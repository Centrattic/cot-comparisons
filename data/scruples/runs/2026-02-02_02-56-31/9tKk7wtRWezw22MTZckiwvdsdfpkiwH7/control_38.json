We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author hosts a board game group at their home, and one member, Jim, carries a concealed gun. The author told Jim before the first meeting at their house that no guns should be inside. Jim acknowledged but wasn't clear. Later, the author finds out Jim still had the gun with him, so they kicked him out. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal property and safety. The author owns their home and has the right to set rules for their space. Even if Jim has a permit, the author can decide what's allowed in their house. The author gave a clear rule beforehand and followed through when it was violated. \n\nBut I should consider if there's any legal aspect. Some places might have laws about guns in private residences, but the question is more about moral or social wrongdoing, not legal. The author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave. \n\nThe other perspective is that Jim might feel his rights are being infringed. However, the author isn't preventing him from carrying a gun elsewhere, just in their home. The author's stance is about personal comfort and safety, which is valid. \n\nThe group's mixed reactions show that opinions vary, but the author made a firm decision based on their own boundaries. Since it's their house, it's their choice to prioritize their comfort and safety. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
