We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author has a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim beforehand to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't seem to confirm, and later someone told the author that Jim had the gun with him while they were out of the room. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he was armed, leading Jim to quit. Now the group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, the author's house is their own space. They have the right to set rules for their home. Even though Jim has a legal permit, the author is within their rights to request no guns in their home. That's a basic safety and privacy issue. The author gave a clear warning first, so it's not like Jim was caught off guard. Jim's action of keeping the gun despite the warning could be seen as a violation of the host's terms.\n\nBut, the author could have handled it differently. Instead of immediately kicking Jim out after one incident, maybe discussing it again or being more explicit about the consequences. However, the author did state their position upfront, and Jim's behavior crossed that line. The other group members' reactions also suggest that some support the author's decision.\n\nAnother angle: Jim might feel his rights were infringed because he's legally allowed to carry. But the author's right to their own property takes precedence here. It's a personal choice about safety and comfort in their home. The fact that Jim is now sending conflicting messages (removing number but sending propaganda) shows he's upset, but that's his response, not the author's fault.\n\nSo, considering property rights and the author's right to enforce their own rules, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
