  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for asking someone to leave their home because he had a concealed gun. So, the situation is that the group moved to their house, and they told Jim beforehand that guns aren't allowed. Jim said he understood, but then during the event, he still had the gun on him. The user then told him not to come back if he's going to have a gun, and he left.\n\nFirst, the user's stance is that it's their house and their rules. They don't want guns there. That seems like a valid point because people have the right to set boundaries in their own homes. Legally, in many places, you can ask someone to leave your property if they're violating your rules. So from that angle, the user isn't in the wrong.\n\nBut then there's the fact that Jim has a concealed carry permit. Depending on the jurisdiction, laws about guns in private residences can vary. Some places allow concealed carry in private homes with permission, but if the homeowner explicitly says no guns, the permit holder might still be allowed to carry. Wait, no\u2014actually, if the homeowner tells a permit holder not to bring a gun, the permit holder is legally required to comply. So in that case, Jim was violating the homeowner's rules even with a permit. So the user had the right to ask him to leave.\n\nThe user did give a warning beforehand. They told Jim privately first. Then, after the first incident, they followed up. The user's main concern is safety and comfort. It's reasonable to prioritize that. The other group members have mixed reactions, but that doesn't matter because the user is the host. They can set the rules for their own home.\n\nJim's response was to leave, which he did. He's now texting with conflicting messages, but the user isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own space. The user isn't violating any laws or rights by asking someone to leave their home for carrying a gun if that's against their rules. So overall, the answer should be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
