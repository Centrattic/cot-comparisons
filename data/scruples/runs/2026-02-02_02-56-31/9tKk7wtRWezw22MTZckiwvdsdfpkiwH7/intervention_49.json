  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for asking a group member to leave their home because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the key points: The group moved to the person's house, and they made it clear that no guns were allowed. Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, was told to leave his gun in his truck. However, he still had the gun on him during the first meeting at the house. The host confronted him, leading to Jim leaving the group. The rest of the group is split on whether the host was right.\n\nThe host's perspective is that it's their home, so they set the rules. They see the presence of a gun as a serious issue and addressed it immediately. Jim's side is that he has a permit and hasn't had issues before, but the host's house is a private space where the owner can set their boundaries.\n\nLegally, in most places, if the host is comfortable with guns, they can allow them. But since the host is anti-gun, they can also restrict them. The host made their stance clear beforehand, and Jim didn't comply. The host's action was to protect their own comfort and safety, which is their right. The fact that Jim didn't follow the rule and continued to bring the gun despite being told shows a disregard for the host's rules. \n\nThe other group members' reactions don't negate the host's right to set boundaries. Even if some think it was harsh, the host has the authority over their home. The ongoing communication from Jim after being asked to leave might indicate he's not accepting responsibility, which supports the host's decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the host isn't in the wrong. They had the right to enforce their rules in their own home, and Jim's actions breached that. The answer should be B.\n"
