  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking someone to leave their hobby group because he brought a concealed gun to their house. They mentioned they told Jim privately beforehand that guns weren't allowed, and he didn't fully confirm he'd follow that. Then after the first meeting, Jim still had the gun with him when they weren't present, leading to the user kicking him out.\n\nFirst, the user's stance is their house, their rules. That's a common-sense view. People should feel safe in their own homes. Guns can be a sensitive issue, especially for someone who's anti-gun. The user set a clear boundary before the event, which is reasonable. Jim didn't adhere to that, so the user took action. \n\nJim's response was to leave the group, which he did. The others in the group have mixed reactions, but some support the user's decision. The user's main point is about safety and respecting their personal space. They didn't act out of malice but to enforce a rule they set. \n\nNow, considering if they're in the wrong. Legally, the user can set rules for their house, including no guns, unless there's a specific law against it. But the question is about moral or social wrongdoing. Since they communicated their rules upfront, and Jim didn't comply, the user's action is justified. The user isn't being unreasonable; they're upholding their own safety standards. The fact that others have mixed reactions doesn't make the user wrong. They had a valid reason and handled it directly. So, answer B: No.\n"
