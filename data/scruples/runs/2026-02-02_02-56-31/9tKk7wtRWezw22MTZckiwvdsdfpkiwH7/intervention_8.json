  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking a group member with a concealed gun to leave their home. They set up the situation: it's their house, they told Jim privately not to bring the gun, but he still did. Then after a game night, someone told them Jim had the gun there when they were in the kitchen. The user texted him to leave the group if he's going to bring the gun. Jim quit. The group is split on whether it's fair. The user's point is that it's their house and their rules. Jim is now sending conflicting messages and propaganda.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main factors here. The user has a right to control their own home. Many people are uncomfortable with guns in their homes, especially if they're anti-gun. The user did communicate the rule to Jim beforehand. Jim didn't follow the rule, even after being asked. The user's response was to not allow him to come again if he didn't comply. That seems like a reasonable boundary. The fact that Jim had a concealed carry permit doesn't necessarily override the host's rules. People can choose their friends and group members based on their comfort levels. \n\nBut some might argue that Jim was just following the law by having his concealed gun, and the user is overreacting. However, in many places, it's legal for someone to carry a concealed weapon in private property unless the owner prohibits it. So the user's rule is valid. The user did give a clear instruction, and Jim didn't adhere, leading to the user enforcing the rule. The user's action was to protect their own space and safety, which is a personal right. \n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed, but that's common in such situations. The user isn't in the wrong for setting personal boundaries, especially when it's their home. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
