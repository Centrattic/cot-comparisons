We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The situation is that the author made it clear they don't want guns in their home and Jim was carrying one. The author asked him to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim still carried it into the house. Then, after the first meeting at the author's house, someone else told the author that Jim was still carrying the gun when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he had the gun, leading to Jim leaving.\n\nFirst, the author's house. So, the author has the right to set rules in their own home. They made their stance clear beforehand. Jim had a concealed carry permit, but the author didn't want any guns there. The key point is whether Jim violated the author's rules. The author told him to leave the gun in the truck, but he didn't comply. Then, when the author found out he still had the gun, they asked him not to come again.\n\nThe author's perspective is that it's their house and their rules. The other group members have mixed reactions. One side says it's harsh but fair, another thinks the author was too uptight. But the author's argument is that it's a serious issue, not a minor rule like snacks. \n\nLegally, in the US, even if someone has a concealed carry permit, the homeowner can set their own policies. So the author isn't in the wrong for asking Jim to leave the gun. Also, the author gave a heads-up before the event. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author enforced the rule. The author's action was to protect their own space and safety. \n\nJim, on the other hand, might have felt his rights were infringed, but in this context, the author's right to their own home takes precedence. The author's response was reasonable given the circumstances. The fact that Jim continued to carry despite the warning makes the author's decision justified. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author clearly communicated their rule, and Jim broke it. The author's decision to remove him from the group in their own home is within their rights.\n"
