  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they were wrong to kick someone out of their hobby group for carrying a concealed gun to their home. Let me break down the details provided.\n\nFirst, the user's hobby group meets regularly, and they've shifted locations to the user's house. There are five people in total. Jim, one of the members, has a concealed carry permit and has mentioned he's always armed. The user told Jim privately before the first game night at their house that no guns are allowed, specifying that he should leave his in his truck if he brought it. Jim's response was acknowledging but not fully confirming. Then, after the first session, someone else told the user that Jim still had his gun with him when they were out of earshot. The user then texted Jim, saying he was disrespectful and that he couldn't come anymore if he had the gun. Jim responded that he wouldn't come back, effectively leaving the group.\n\nThe user's perspective is that it's their house, so they have the right to set rules against guns. The other group members have mixed reactions: one doesn't care, one thinks it was harsh but fair, and another thinks the user was overreacting. Jim continues to text the user, sometimes saying to lose his number and sending anti-user links.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong. The key points here are about the user's right to their own home and rules versus Jim's right to carry a concealed gun. In the US, under the Second Amendment, individuals with a concealed carry permit can legally carry a gun in public places. However, private property owners can set their own rules. So, the user isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave the gun outside.\n\nThe user did communicate the rule beforehand and gave Jim a chance to comply. However, Jim didn't follow the rule, which led the user to take action. The user's reaction was to exclude Jim for violating the rule, which is within their rights as the host. The user's concern about safety is valid, as having a gun in the home, even if the person is permitted, can be a safety issue for the host and others.\n\nThe mixed reactions from the group don't necessarily mean the user is wrong. Some people might prioritize safety over others' rights, while others might see it as harsh. But from a legal standpoint and personal safety perspective, the user's actions seem justified. The issue here is about personal boundaries in a private space. The user isn't obligated to allow someone to carry a gun in their home, even if that person has a legal right to do so elsewhere. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for enforcing their rules.\n"
