We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts game nights at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their home, so he should leave it in his truck. Jim responded ambiguously. Later, another member tells the author that Jim still had the gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then texts Jim, saying he's disrespectful and can't come back if he brings a gun. Jim leaves the group. Some group members think it's fair, others think it's harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal property rights and safety. The author is making a rule for their home. They had a conversation with Jim upfront, which is reasonable. Even though Jim might have thought he could bring the gun (since he has a permit), the author's house is private property. The author set the rule, and when Jim didn't comply, they enforced it. \n\nJim's actions could be seen as a violation of the agreed-upon rules. Even if he had the right to carry in public, in a private home, the host can set their own rules. The author's stance is about feeling safe in their own space, which is a valid concern. The other members' mixed reactions don't negate the author's right to make that decision. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing? The author didn't force Jim to leave; they gave a clear rule, Jim didn't follow it, and then left voluntarily. The author isn't preventing someone from exercising their legal rights in public; they're setting boundaries in their private home. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
