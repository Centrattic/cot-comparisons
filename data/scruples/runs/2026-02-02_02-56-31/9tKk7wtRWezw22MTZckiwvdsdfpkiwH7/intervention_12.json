  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were wrong for asking someone to leave their hobby group because he brought a concealed gun to their house. They mentioned being anti-gun but it's their home, so they set the rule. The other person, Jim, didn't comply, and now the group is split on whether it was fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he might legally be allowed to carry in that state. But the host's home is private property, so they can set their own rules about guns. So legally, the host has the right to ask him to leave if he doesn't follow the rules.\n\nNext, the social situation. The host felt uncomfortable and addressed it before the first game night. Jim didn't comply, which led to the host taking action. The host's main concern is safety and personal comfort. They didn't make a big deal about minor things but took a firm stance on the gun because it's a serious issue. The group's mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the host was wrong; it's about personal boundaries.\n\nJim's response was to quit, which he had the right to do. The host isn't forcing him to stay. The fact that Jim is continuing to contact the host with conflicting messages might complicate things, but the initial decision to set the rule seems valid. The host isn't in the wrong because they're enforcing their own home's rules, which is their right. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
