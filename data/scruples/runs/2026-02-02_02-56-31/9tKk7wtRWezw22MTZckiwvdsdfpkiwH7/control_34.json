We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he carried a concealed gun to their home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is hosting a game night at their house and has made it clear they don't want guns there. Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, was told to leave his gun in his truck. But during the first event, Jim still had the gun with him when the author wasn't around. The author then told him he couldn't come back if he was armed, leading Jim to leave.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house, and they have the right to set rules. Jim, on the other hand, might argue that he's within his legal rights to carry, even in someone else's home in some states. However, the author specifically communicated their discomfort, so Jim's choice to ignore that could be seen as a violation of their hospitality.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, the author can set their own rules for their home. Socially, it's about respecting boundaries. Jim was informed beforehand and still chose to ignore it, which might make the author justified in removing him. The other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily reflect the rightness but show different perspectives.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Some might argue that the author could have handled it more gracefully, like discussing it further instead of an immediate kickout. However, the author's main point is that it's their house and they have the right to enforce their rules. Since Jim violated a clear boundary, the author's action seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
