We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author hosts a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author told Jim upfront that guns aren't allowed in their house, so he should leave it in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't clearly affirming. Then, during the first game night, Jim kept his gun with him when he shouldn't have, according to another group member. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit. The rest of the group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author made their rules clear before the event. They specified that guns weren't allowed. Jim didn't comply, which the author saw as a serious issue. The author's main argument is that it's their house and they set the rules. On the other hand, some might argue that Jim had a concealed carry permit and that he was following the law by carrying in public, so the author's rule might infringe on his rights. But in the US, private property owners can set their own rules about guns, even if they're more restrictive than local laws. So the author has the right to prohibit guns in their home. \n\nJim's actions\u2014bringing the gun despite being told not to\u2014could be seen as a violation of the host's rules. The author made it clear, and Jim didn't follow through. The author then took action after the violation. The other group members' mixed reactions don't change the fact that the author is within their rights to enforce their rules. The argument that the author was \"uptight\" might be a personal opinion but doesn't negate the author's right to set boundaries. Also, the author's concern about safety is valid, and they had the right to prioritize their comfort and safety in their own home. So, based on this reasoning, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
