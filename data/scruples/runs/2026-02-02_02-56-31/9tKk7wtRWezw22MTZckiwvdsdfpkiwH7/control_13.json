We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he carried a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the key points here are that the author made it clear they didn't want guns in their house and asked Jim to leave his at his truck. Jim didn't follow through and still had the gun on him when the author wasn't around. Then another group member told the author about it. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had the gun. Jim left the group.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and they have the right to set rules. The other group members have mixed reactions. Some think it's harsh but fair, others think the author was too strict. \n\nNow, considering the legality, Jim has a concealed carry permit, which means he's legally allowed to carry. However, in private homes, the owner can set their own rules. So the author isn't violating any laws by banning guns in their home. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally or socially. The author gave a warning first, and Jim didn't comply. The author then took action after the violation. Jim was informed and left after being told. \n\nThe other group member's opinion is split. One person doesn't care, another thinks it's fair, and one thinks the author was too uptight. But the author's main argument is about safety and personal comfort in their own home. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they own the space and set clear boundaries. Jim didn't adhere to them, and the author followed through with the consequence. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
