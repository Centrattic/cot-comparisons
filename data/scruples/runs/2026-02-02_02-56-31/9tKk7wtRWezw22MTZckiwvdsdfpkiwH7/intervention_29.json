  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because that person brought a concealed gun to their house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user's house. They've set up a game night there, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The user told Jim upfront that no guns are allowed in their house. Jim said he understood but later, when the user was in the kitchen, Jim was still carrying the gun. The user then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun, and Jim left. The user is now getting mixed reactions from the group. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh but okay, and one is critical.\n\nThe user's main point is that it's their house, and they have the right to set rules. They don't want guns in their home for safety reasons. They acted quickly because they consider it a serious issue, not a minor infraction. Jim is retaliating with texts and sending propaganda.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the user made clear their rules before the event. They gave Jim a chance to comply, but he didn't. The user then enforced the rule after the fact. Legally, as the host, they can set their own rules regarding weapons on their property. It's their right to feel unsafe and to enforce that. The other members' mixed reactions don't negate that. Even if Jim has a permit, the user's right to their own space is key here. The user didn't kick Jim out publicly; they privately addressed it. So, the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong because it's their house and they have the right to enforce their rules.\n"
