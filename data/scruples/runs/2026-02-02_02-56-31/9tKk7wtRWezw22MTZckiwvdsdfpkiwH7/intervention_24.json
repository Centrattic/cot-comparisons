We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They run a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The user told Jim privately not to bring the gun into the house. Jim seemed to agree, but later someone else told the user that Jim had the gun with him when the user was in the kitchen. The user then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, and Jim quit. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe user's stance is that it's their house and their rules. They don't think it's unreasonable to not want a gun there. Jim is now pestering them with texts and sending propaganda.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. To answer A or B. \n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the user's right to set rules in their own home. Legally, in the US, as a homeowner, you can set your own policies regarding guns. Some states have specific laws about this, but generally, the homeowner can request that guns not be brought into their property. So, the user isn't breaking any laws by asking Jim not to have a gun in their house.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The user had previously communicated the rule, and Jim either misunderstood or didn't comply. The user then took action after the breach. It's their home, so enforcing their rules isn't unreasonable. The fact that Jim didn't follow the rule after being told is Jim's issue, not the user's. \n\nThe group's mixed reactions don't matter as much. The user's right to their own space and safety comes into play. Even if others think it's harsh, the user isn't in the wrong for standing their ground on safety. \n\nJim's response of quitting is his choice. He can choose not to participate if he can't comply with the rules. The user isn't obligated to let him stay if he breaks the rules. The continued contact from Jim is separate, but the initial decision to remove him isn't wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, not in the wrong). The user had the right to set the rule, communicated it, and followed through when it was broken. It's their space, and safety concerns are valid. The other group members' opinions don't override that.\n"
