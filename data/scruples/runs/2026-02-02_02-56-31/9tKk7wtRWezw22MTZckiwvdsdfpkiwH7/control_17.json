We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of his concealed gun. So, the situation is that the group now meets at the author's house, and Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, was told to leave his gun in his truck. But then, after the first game night, another member told the author that Jim had his gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he had a gun, leading to Jim quitting. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, in the U.S., if someone has a valid permit, they can carry a gun in public places. However, private property owners can set their own rules. The author owns their home, so they can decide whether guns are allowed. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong here because they can enforce their rules on their property.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author had already communicated clearly to Jim before the first meeting at their house that guns weren't allowed. Jim was aware of this. However, he still brought the gun, even if he didn't explicitly confirm he would leave it in the truck. The author's decision to enforce the rule after the first incident is about their personal boundaries. It's their space, so they have the right to prioritize their comfort and safety.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions don't necessarily make the author wrong. Some people might think it's a big deal, others not. But the key is that the author's house, their rules. The fact that Jim continued to argue via texts after being asked to leave suggests he didn't take the request seriously, which might validate the author's stance.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author gave a clear warning before the first meeting, and Jim might have believed he was complying, but then broke the rule. The author acted when the rule was broken, which is a reasonable response. The author isn't forcing Jim to not have a gun; they are just not allowing it in their home. That's a standard host rule, like no smoking or no pets.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They set clear boundaries, and Jim violated them. The author has the right to enforce their rules on their property. The answer should be B (No).\n"
