  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking someone to leave their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. They mention that they're anti-gun, and they had already told Jim to leave his gun in his truck. But Jim still had it with him during the event at their house, which led to the user kicking him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of concealed carry in the area. If Jim has a valid permit, he's legally allowed to carry a gun in most places, except maybe certain private properties that prohibit it. The user's house is private property, so if they have a rule against guns, they can require Jim to leave it outside. But if the law requires that he can carry in his own vehicle even on private property, maybe there's a conflict. However, the user's main point is about their own home. If the user made it clear that no guns are allowed, Jim's presence with a gun could be a violation of that rule. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The user's comfort in their own home is important. They made their stance clear before the event, but Jim still brought the gun. The user's reaction was to kick him out after the fact because he didn't follow the rule. The other group members are split, which shows that maybe some see it as reasonable while others don't. \n\nThe user's actions seem to be within their rights as the host of the event. They set the rules, and Jim didn't comply. The user didn't make a big deal until after the fact when they found out. It's possible that the user could have addressed it during the event, but they chose to act after, which might be seen as a bit late. However, the main issue is the violation of the stated rule. \n\nI should also consider if there's any obligation to allow someone's legal rights, even in private spaces. But in this case, the user's house is their own space, and they can set the rules. So, the user isn't in the wrong for enforcing their rule. The answer would be B.\n"
