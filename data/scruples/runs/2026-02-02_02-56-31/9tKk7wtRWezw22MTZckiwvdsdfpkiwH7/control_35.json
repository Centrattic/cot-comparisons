We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that the author hosts game nights at their house, and Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, brought his gun. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed, but Jim still had it with him during a session. The author then asked him to leave the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if Jim has a valid permit, he can carry in public places. However, private property is different. The author's home is private property, so they can set their own rules. So legally, the author has the right to prohibit guns on their premises. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the personal right to feel safe. The author is anti-gun, which is their right. Having a gun in the house might make them uncomfortable or unsafe. Since it's their home, they can enforce rules that make them comfortable. Others in the group have mixed reactions, but the author's decision is about their own space.\n\nJim's actions: He was told beforehand to leave the gun in his truck, but he didn't. That's a breach of the host's rules. The author addressed it after the first incident, which seems reasonable. Kicking someone out for not following a clear rule is within the host's rights.\n\nThe argument that it was \"harsh\" might come from others not valuing the host's safety. But the author had a right to enforce their rules. The fact that Jim is still contacting the author with links doesn't change the initial decision's validity.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author made a reasonable decision to enforce their home's rules for their safety and comfort. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
