We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote about kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts a board game group at their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author told Jim privately to leave his gun in the truck. Jim's response was not fully affirming. Later, another member tells the author that Jim had his gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author confronts Jim, leading to him leaving the group. The group has mixed reactions. The author's stance is that it's their house and their rules.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Key factors here are the author's right to set boundaries in their own home versus Jim's right to carry a concealed gun. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state, but generally, if someone has a permit, they can carry in public places. However, private property owners can set their own rules. So the author is within their legal right to prohibit guns in their home, even if someone has a permit. \n\nThe author communicated the rule clearly. Jim, despite being told to leave his gun in the truck, didn't comply. The author then enforced the rule by asking him not to come back if he's carrying. Jim left on his own, so the author didn't \"kick him out\" per se. The other group members have mixed opinions, but that's common in such situations. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on personal comfort and safety in their own home. Since it's their property, they have the right to set such conditions. Jim's actions violated the rule the author set, so the author's response seems justified. The fact that Jim continued to text with conflicting messages might show he wasn't fully committed to following the rule. \n\nSo, considering the legal rights and the situation, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a clear boundary and enforced it when it was violated. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
