We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a board game group that moves to their house, and one member, Jim, carries a concealed gun. The author tells Jim not to bring the gun, but Jim still brings it. The author then kicks him out.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house where the meetings are now held. They set a rule about no guns in the house. Jim had a concealed carry permit but didn't follow the rule. The author's stance is that it's their house and their rules. That seems like a valid point. Jim should have respected that. \n\nThe user is asking if the author was wrong to kick Jim out. The key factors here are consent and personal boundaries. The author made it clear before the first meeting at their house that guns weren't allowed. Jim's response wasn't a clear agreement, but the author still set the expectation. When Jim didn't comply, the author took action. \n\nJim's actions could be seen as a violation of the author's stated rules. The author isn't violating any laws by setting their house rules. Even if Jim had a permit, the author is under no legal obligation to allow a gun in their home. The split reactions from the group aren't relevant to the author's right to enforce their own space. \n\nThe author's response was firm but justified. They didn't make a big deal out of something minor; it was a safety-related rule. Jim's continued presence with the gun after being asked not to bring it would be a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
