  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking a group member to leave because he brought a gun to their house. They have a board game group that moved to their home, and Jim has a concealed carry permit. The user told him upfront not to bring guns, but later found out he still had it with him. The user then asked him to leave, leading to him quitting. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, the user's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules. Legally, in most places, the homeowner can set rules about guns on their property. So they have the right to prohibit guns in their home. The user made it clear beforehand, which is reasonable. Jim, having a concealed carry permit, might have brought the gun expecting to carry it, but the user's house isn't a public space where concealed carry is mandatory. The user's action was based on personal comfort and safety, which is valid.\n\nHowever, some might argue that Jim was following the law by carrying, but the user's right to their home overrides that. The user didn't make it a public issue but addressed it privately first. The split reactions in the group show differing opinions, but the user's actions were within their rights. The ongoing texts from Jim suggest he's upset, but the user isn't obligated to keep him in the group if he doesn't comply with the rules. So, the answer is B.\n"
