  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking someone to not bring a concealed gun to their house during a hobby group. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe user hosts a board game group at their house now. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The user told Jim privately to leave his gun in the truck. Then after a game night, someone told them that Jim still had his gun with him when the user was in the kitchen. The user then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun, and Jim quit. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe user's main argument is that it's their house, and they set the rules. They consider this a serious matter. Jim is sending conflicting messages now. The user is upset and wants to know if they were wrong.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, in the US, as a homeowner, you can set rules about guns on your property. Even if someone has a concealed carry permit, you can ask them to leave the weapon if they enter your home. The user isn't violating any laws here by doing that.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's about personal comfort and safety. The user doesn't want guns in their home, which is a valid personal choice. They addressed it privately first, which is reasonable. Then, after the second incident, they made a firm decision. Jim chose to leave, which is his choice as well.\n\nSome might argue that it was harsh, but since it's the user's home, they have the right to enforce their rules. The fact that Jim had a permit doesn't override the homeowner's right to restrict guns in their house. The user's actions are about personal safety and comfort, which is a strong justification.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions are common in such situations. One person doesn't care, another thinks it's fair, and one thinks it's too strict. But the user's stance is consistent with their right to control their space. Jim's continued texting and sending links show he's upset, but that doesn't make the user wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They set a clear boundary, and Jim chose to leave. The answer should be B (No).\n"
