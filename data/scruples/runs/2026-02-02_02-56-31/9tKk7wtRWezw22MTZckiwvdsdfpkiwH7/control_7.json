We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The author's house is the meeting place now, and Jim has a concealed carry permit but the author is anti-gun. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but if Jim has a valid permit, he's probably allowed to carry in that area. However, the author owns the house, so they can set their own rules. Some places allow private property owners to prohibit guns, even if the person has a permit. So legally, the author might be in the right.\n\nThen there's the matter of safety. The author is uncomfortable with guns in their home, and since they're anti-gun, this is a personal boundary. They gave Jim a heads-up before the event, which is fair. When Jim didn't comply, the author had to enforce the rule, which makes sense because allowing guns could make others feel unsafe too.\n\nLooking at the group's reaction, some people think it's harsh but fair, others don't care, and one thinks the author was too uptight. The author's reasoning is about their own home and safety, which is a valid concern. The fact that Jim continued to text with links to propaganda suggests he's not backing down, but the author's decision was about a one-time rule violation after prior notice. \n\nSo, the author's actions seem justified. They set clear rules for their home, and when someone broke them, they took appropriate action. It's their right to control their space, and the issue isn't something trivial like snacks. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
