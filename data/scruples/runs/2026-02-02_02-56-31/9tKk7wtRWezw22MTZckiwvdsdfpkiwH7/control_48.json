We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts a board game group at their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author is anti-gun but hadn't mentioned it before. Before the first meeting at their house, they privately told Jim to leave the gun in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't clearly affirmative. Then, during the event, Jim kept the gun on him when the author wasn't around, and the author found out from another member. They then told Jim he couldn't come again if he had a gun. Jim left the group. The group's reactions are mixed, and the author is now being criticized by some.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal property rights versus others' rights. The author owns their home and can set rules about what's allowed there. Guns are a sensitive topic, and depending on the jurisdiction, there might be laws about carrying guns in private residences. But the author explicitly told Jim their rule, and Jim didn't follow it. The author took action after the first incident, which might be seen as strict, but it's their right to enforce their own space.\n\nBut wait, does Jim's concealed carry permit affect this? In some places, a private homeowner can prohibit guns on their property even if the person has a permit. So the author's rule is valid. The author didn't kick Jim out immediately but gave a warning first. However, Jim didn't comply, leading to the final decision. The author's stance is about their comfort and safety, which is understandable.\n\nThe counterargument might be that the author was too quick to remove Jim over a single occurrence. But the author felt it was a serious issue, not a minor infraction. Since it's their home, they have the right to prioritize their comfort and safety. The other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author was wrong. They set a boundary, and Jim didn't respect it. The author's actions are within their rights, so the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
