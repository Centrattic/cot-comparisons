  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they did the right thing by asking someone to leave their game group because he was carrying a concealed gun. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is the host of the game nights. They moved the meetings to their house because they got closer and the original location was in a less safe area. The group has five members. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The user told Jim privately that they don't want any guns in their house, so he should leave his in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't clearly affirming. Then, after the first game night, another member found out that Jim still had his gun with him while the user was in the kitchen. The user then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had the gun, leading to Jim quitting the group. The reactions from the others are mixed.\n\nThe user feels it's their house, so they have the right to set rules. Jim argues he has a right to carry, but the user is anti-gun. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nLegally, in the U.S., if someone has a concealed carry permit, they can carry in most places, including private property unless the host explicitly prohibits it. So the user has the right to ask him not to carry in their home. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the user had the right to enforce it. The user's action was about safety and personal comfort in their own home. The user did give a warning first, then followed up when the rule was broken. The user's decision to exclude Jim was based on respecting their own space and safety.\n\nOthers in the group have mixed reactions, but the user's actions are justified. It's their home, and they can set boundaries. Even if others disagree, the user isn't in the wrong for enforcing their rules. The key points are ownership of the space and prior communication of the rule. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
