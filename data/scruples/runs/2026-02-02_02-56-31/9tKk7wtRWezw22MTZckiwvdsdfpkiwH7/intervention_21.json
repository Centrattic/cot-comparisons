  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for asking a group member to leave their game night because he had a concealed gun. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: They have a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he carries a gun. The user told Jim he can't have the gun in the house, but Jim didn't follow through and still had it during the game night. The user then kicked Jim out, and the group is split on whether it's fair.\n\nSo, the user's main argument is that it's their house and they can set rules. They don't want guns there. Jim didn't comply with the agreed-upon rule, so the user took action. Now, the others are divided. \n\nI need to consider a few things. Legally, in the US, as a property owner, you can set rules about what's allowed on your property. So, the user has the right to say no guns. Jim, having a concealed carry permit, might be allowed to carry in public, but private property rules can override that. The user gave a heads-up before the first game night, so Jim had a choice to comply or not attend. \n\nThe user's response was to ask Jim to leave after he violated the rule. Since it was their home, that's within their rights. However, some might argue that it's a small issue over a hobby group and that people should be more flexible. But the user's stance is about personal safety and comfort. \n\nThe user also mentions that Jim later harassed them with texts and propaganda links. That might not be relevant to the initial decision but shows ongoing conflict. \n\nThe group's mixed reactions: some say it's harsh but fair, others think it's being too uptight. The key factor is the user's right to their own space. Unless there's a legal obligation to allow the gun, the user isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). They had the right to set boundaries in their home. The user acted in their own comfort and safety, which is valid. The fact that Jim didn't comply and then left voluntarily supports that the user had the right to enforce the rule.\n"
