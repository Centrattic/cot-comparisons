We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he carried a concealed gun to their house. The author is anti-gun but had allowed the group to meet at their home, which they own. They informed the member (Jim) beforehand that guns weren't allowed, but he still brought his gun. The author then asked him not to come back if he was going to have a gun.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the U.S., concealed carry laws vary by state, but generally, if someone has a valid permit, they can carry in public places. However, private property rules can differ. The author owns their home, so they can set their own rules. Legally, the author isn't obligated to allow guns on their property, even if the person has a permit. So, from a legal standpoint, the author is within their rights to enforce a no-guns policy in their home.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The group had moved meetings to the author's home, and the author had communicated the rule clearly before the meeting. Jim's actions violated that rule, which the author considered important enough to enforce. The author's decision to ask him to leave wasn't based on a minor issue like snacks but a serious one\u2014guns in the home. The other group members' reactions are mixed, but two support the author's decision. It seems the author prioritized their personal safety and comfort, which is understandable.\n\nJim's response was to leave the group, which he had the right to do. The author isn't at fault for enforcing their own house rules. The argument that the author was \"uptight\" or too harsh doesn't outweigh the author's right to control their property. Also, Jim's continued texting with mixed messages after being asked to leave might indicate his own issues, not the author's wrongdoing.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within their rights and made a reasonable decision based on their personal boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
