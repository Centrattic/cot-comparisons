  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a board game group that meets at the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author is anti-gun and told Jim he had to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't follow that, and after the first game night, another member told the author that Jim still had his gun with him. The author then kicked Jim out, and now there's some backlash from the group.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear before the event that guns weren't allowed in their home. That seems like a reasonable request since it's their house. They gave a specific instruction to Jim. Then Jim didn't comply, and the author acted on it. The key point here is whether the author overstepped by removing Jim because of his gun. \n\nSince the author communicated their rules in advance, and Jim didn't follow them, the author had the right to enforce that. It's their property, so they can set the conditions for being there. Jim's choice to carry a gun in a private residence where it's prohibited is on him. The author isn't violating any laws or rights by asking someone to leave if they don't follow the house rules. \n\nThe other group members have mixed reactions, but one person's opinion that it was \"harsh but fair\" suggests that while some might see it as strict, it's understandable. The person who thinks the author is a shrew might just be in disagreement with the strictness, but the author's stance is about personal safety and comfort. \n\nJim's continued texting with propaganda links is an example of the conflict escalating, but the initial action was about enforcing house rules. The author isn't in the wrong here because they have the right to control their space. The answer should be B (No).\n"
