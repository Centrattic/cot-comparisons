  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for asking Jim to leave the group because he had a concealed gun. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user hosts a board game group that recently moved to their house. Jim, one of the five members, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The user told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their house, asking him to leave the gun in his truck. Jim responded with an acknowledging but not exactly agreeing reply. Then, after the first game night, another group member told the user that Jim had his gun on him while they were out of earshot. The user then sent Jim a text saying it's not a game and he can't come if he has a gun. Jim quit the group. The reactions from others are mixed, with one thinking it's harsh but fair, one indifferent, and another saying the user is being uptight. The user now faces Jim's mixed messages and propaganda links.\n\nFirst, the user's main point is that it's their house and their rules. Legally, as a gun owner, Jim might have the right to carry in public, but in a private residence, the host can set their own policies. So the user isn't violating any laws by asking him not to bring a gun into their home. \n\nHowever, the user did give Jim a chance by asking him to leave the gun in the truck. Jim's response wasn't explicitly confirming he'd follow the rule, so maybe he didn't take it seriously. Then, when the user found out he still had the gun, they took action. The user's decision seems to be about personal safety and comfort. \n\nThe user is anti-gun, which is their personal belief. The fact that Jim was carrying in a private home where the host had explicitly asked him not to might be seen as a breach of trust or boundaries. The user didn't just kick him out immediately; they gave a warning first. Jim's choice to leave after being told again suggests he wasn't willing to comply, so the user's action was enforcing their own rules.\n\nThe other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily invalidate the user's decision. The user isn't in a position to force others to accept weapons in their home. It's about personal space and safety. The user isn't being unreasonable here. Jim could have chosen to respect the host's wishes or leave, but he didn't. The user isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary they're comfortable with.\n"
