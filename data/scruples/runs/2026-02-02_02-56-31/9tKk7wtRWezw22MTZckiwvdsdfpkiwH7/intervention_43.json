  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking a group member to leave their home because he was carrying a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: They host a hobby group at their home. Jim has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The user told Jim he couldn't have the gun in the house. Jim agreed but later was still carrying it during a session. The user then asked him to leave, leading to Jim quitting the group.\n\nNow, the user's perspective is that it's their house, so they can set the rules. They don't want guns there. Jim's response was to stop attending. The group has mixed reactions.\n\nLegally, in the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If the user's state allows concealed carry, then Jim could legally have the gun on him, but the user has the right to prohibit it in their home. Some states allow property owners to restrict guns on their premises, even if the person has a permit. So the user isn't breaking any laws by setting that rule.\n\nMoral standpoint: The user is comfortable with their home being a gun-free zone. They addressed the issue directly and privately first. When Jim didn't comply, they took action. It's their choice to prioritize their comfort and safety. On the other hand, Jim might feel it's unfair since he's legally allowed to carry, but the user's right to their own home takes precedence here.\n\nThe other group members have varied opinions, but that's expected. The user isn't wrong for enforcing their own rules, especially regarding something as personal as having a gun in their home. Jim chose to leave, which is his right too. The user isn't being unreasonable; they set clear boundaries and followed through when those boundaries were crossed.\n\nSo, considering both legal and personal rights, the user isn't in the wrong. They're upholding their own safety and comfort in their home. The answer should be B.\n"
