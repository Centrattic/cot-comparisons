  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user, let's call them Alex, is asking if they're in the wrong for asking someone named Jim to leave their house during a hobby group meeting because Jim has a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Jim has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. Alex is anti-gun but this never came up before. When the group moved to Alex's house, Alex told Jim to leave his gun in the truck. Jim didn't explicitly agree but didn't say no either. Later, Alex finds out that Jim still had the gun in the house during the session. Alex then tells Jim he can't come anymore if he brings a gun, and Jim quits. The group is split in their reactions.\n\nNow, the key points here: it's Alex's house, so they have the right to set rules. Alex didn't want guns in their home, which is a personal boundary. Jim had a concealed permit, so he's allowed to carry in public areas, but when entering a private home, that's different. Jim didn't follow Alex's rule, and Alex enforced their boundary. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, Jim may have the right to carry in public but not in private homes unless the homeowner allows it. So Alex's request aligns with the law. Jim's presence with a gun in the house could make others uncomfortable, even if he's legally allowed. Alex had to make a decision for their own comfort and safety, and it's reasonable to enforce that once it's their home.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions don't change the fact that it's Alex's house. The one person who says it's harsh but fair probably recognizes the right to have such a rule. Another person doesn't care, but it's about Alex's boundaries. The last person seems to downplay the issue, but Alex took a firm stance on a serious matter, which is understandable.\n\nJim's response of quitting the group is his choice. Alex made a clear rule, and Jim didn't comply. The back-and-forth with Jim after isn't relevant to whether Alex was in the wrong initially. \n\nSo, the answer is B. Alex wasn't in the wrong because they set a rule for their home and followed through when it was violated. It's about personal space and safety, and that's their right.\n"
