We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is hosting game nights at their house now. They told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed in the house. Jim had a concealed carry permit. The author made it clear he needs to leave his gun in the car. Then, after the first event, it's revealed that Jim still had his gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then texts Jim, telling him he's not allowed anymore if he brings a gun, leading Jim to quit. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nSo, the main issue is about the author enforcing their own house rules. The author's stance is that it's their house and they can set the rules. Jim, on the other hand, has a concealed carry permit, but the author didn't want the gun in their home. The key here is whether the author overstepped by removing Jim for carrying a legally allowed weapon, even though they had been warned.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the author's state has a \"shall issue\" or \"constitutional carry\" policy, Jim might be legally allowed to carry. However, the author is within their rights to set rules for their own property. So even if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the host can ask him to leave the gun at the door. The problem is that Jim didn't comply with the host's request, which is a breach of trust.\n\nThe author could have handled it differently, maybe with more communication. But the fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite the host's explicit request might be a bigger issue. The author is concerned about safety and setting boundaries in their home. Jim's actions were disrespectful, as he didn't follow through on the agreement.\n\nThe group's reactions are split. Some think it's fair because it's the host's house, others think it's harsh. But the core is the host's right to enforce their own rules. So, the author isn't in the wrong for removing Jim for violating the house rules. Jim chose to bring a gun into a space where the host had made it clear it wasn't allowed. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
