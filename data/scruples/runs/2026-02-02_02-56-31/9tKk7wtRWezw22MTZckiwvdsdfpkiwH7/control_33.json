We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a board game group that started meeting at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that they don't want guns in their house, so Jim should leave his in his truck. Jim didn't explicitly agree. Then, after the first game night, another member told the author that Jim had his gun with him when the author was out of the room. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun, and Jim quit. The group's reactions are mixed. The author's stance is that it's their house and their rules, and they considered it a serious matter.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The possible answers are A (Yes) or B (No). Let me think about the key points here.\n\nFirst, the author is the host of their own home. People generally have the right to set rules for their own property. Guns can be a sensitive issue, and the author being anti-gun is their personal stance. Jim, on the other hand, has a concealed carry permit, which means he's legally allowed to carry in public places. However, private property rules might allow the host to ban guns on their premises, even if the guest is legally allowed elsewhere. \n\nThe author gave Jim a heads-up before the event, which is reasonable. But Jim didn't fully comply, as he still brought the gun into the house. The author then enforced their rule after the fact. The problem here might be whether the author overstepped by banning Jim permanently for a single incident. However, the author's reasoning is that it's a serious safety issue, not a minor infraction like bringing the wrong snacks. \n\nSome might argue that the author could have handled it more diplomatically, like removing Jim once they found out, but since the author wasn't present when the gun was there, they had to rely on another member's report. Jim's non-committal response might have contributed to the misunderstanding. \n\nOn the other side, if Jim had a permit and was within legal rights to carry, maybe the author's reaction is too harsh. But since it's the author's home, they can set their boundaries. There's no law against a private host banning guns on their property. So legally and ethically, the author might be justified. \n\nThe group's mixed reactions also play a role. One person says \"harsh but fair,\" which might suggest that while the action was strict, it's understandable. The other person calling the author a \"shrew\" is probably a minority view. \n\nConsidering all that, the main factors are the right to control one's property and the seriousness of the issue. Guns are a major safety concern, so the author having a zero-tolerance policy isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
