  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for asking a guy to leave their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun to their house. They're in a board game group that moved to their house. The user is anti-gun, and they told Jim he had to leave his gun in the truck. But later, they found out he still had the gun with him during the event. The user then told him he couldn't come if he was armed, leading to him leaving the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They own the house and set the rules. They mentioned it's their right to have a gun-free space. They gave a clear warning, and when Jim didn't comply, they took action. That seems reasonable because safety is a valid concern. They didn't make a big deal out of it beyond the issue, just asked him to leave if he wasn't going to follow the rule.\n\nOn the other hand, Jim might argue that he has a legal right to carry a concealed gun, so he felt he had the right to do so in his own home. But the user's house isn't public, so the legal aspect might not apply the same way. However, the user's safety and comfort are their own priorities. They were clear about the rule, and Jim didn't follow it. The user's reaction was to enforce their own boundaries, which is understandable.\n\nThe group's split reactions are normal. Some see it as fair, others not. But the user's main point is about their own space. Even if Jim felt it was harsh, the user isn't obligated to host someone who doesn't respect their rules. The ongoing texts from Jim seem to be his issue, not the user's.\n\nSo, the user is not in the wrong. They set clear boundaries and followed through when they were violated. It's their home, and they have the right to decide who can be there. The answer should be B.\n"
