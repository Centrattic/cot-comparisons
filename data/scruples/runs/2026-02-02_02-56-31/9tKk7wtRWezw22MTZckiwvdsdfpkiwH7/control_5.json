We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun in their home.\n\nFirst, the context: the author hosts a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed in the house, and Jim was supposed to leave his in his truck. However, during the first session at the author's house, Jim kept his gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author found out through another group member and then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he brought a gun. Jim quit the group. The reactions from others are mixed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal property and rules. The author is in their own home, so they have the right to set rules. Guns are a sensitive topic, and the author is anti-gun, so this is a valid concern. The author gave a clear warning beforehand, and Jim didn't comply, leading to the author enforcing their rule. The fact that Jim kept texting with conflicting messages (saying he wanted to leave but then sending propaganda) complicates things, but the initial action was about the author's personal space.\n\nLegally, in many places, the host can set rules about firearms on their property. So the author isn't violating any laws. The author's decision is about personal comfort and safety, which is a reasonable stance. Even though some might think it's extreme, it's their right to enforce their own policies. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
