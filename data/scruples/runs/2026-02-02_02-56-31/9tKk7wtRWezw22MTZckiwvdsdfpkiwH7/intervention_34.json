  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for asking their friend to leave the hobby group because of his concealed gun. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the group used to meet at a shop, but now they're at the person's house. The person is anti-gun, and Jim has a concealed carry permit. The person told Jim privately before the first meeting at their house that no guns would be allowed, specifying that he should leave it in his truck. Jim didn't respond clearly. Then, during the first game night, Jim kept the gun with him when the host was out of earshot. The host found out through another group member, confronts Jim via text, and Jim leaves the group.\n\nThe host's reasoning is that it's their house and their rules. They consider a gun a serious issue, not like a snack mistake. Jim then texts back with mixed messages and sends propaganda.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. Some places allow carrying in private homes with permission, others not. But since Jim has a concealed carry permit, he might legally be allowed to carry in his own home or public places. However, private property rules can vary. If the host doesn't want guns on their property, they have the right to set that rule. But if Jim has a permit, maybe he can carry in public, but private homes might be different. Wait, actually, many states allow CCW in private homes if the owner permits it. So if the host is against it, Jim can't carry there. But if the host didn't explicitly allow it, then Jim is violating their rule.\n\nBut the host did tell Jim beforehand, so Jim should have known. However, Jim still brought the gun. The host is within their rights to enforce their own property rules. So the host isn't in the wrong for asking Jim to leave. The issue is that Jim didn't follow the rule, and the host took action. The host's friends are split, but the main point is about property rights. The host isn't being unreasonable if they set a rule for their home. So answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
