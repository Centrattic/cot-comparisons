  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. They were meeting at a shop before but moved to their house. Jim has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The user told him privately to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim still had it during the first game night at their house. The user then told Jim he couldn't come if he had the gun, and Jim quit. The group is split in their opinions.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and the user's right to set rules for their own home. The user argues it's their house, and not having a gun is a reasonable rule. But Jim had a concealed carry permit, which might mean he's allowed to carry in public places, including someone's home. However, the user isn't saying he can't carry; they just want him to leave it in the truck. The issue is whether the user overstepped by enforcing this rule strictly after one incident.\n\nOn one hand, the user has the right to control who enters their home and what's allowed. They made a clear rule beforehand, and Jim didn't fully comply. On the other hand, Jim might have felt that his rights as a concealed carrier were being violated. But the user didn't ask him to conceal it in the house; they just asked to leave it in the truck. If Jim is allowed to carry in public, then leaving the gun in his truck is a reasonable compromise. However, if he had to have it on him for some reason, maybe during a bathroom break, that's different.\n\nThe user's reaction seems to be about safety and personal comfort. They might be anti-gun, but the main issue is about enforcing their home rules. The other group members have mixed reactions, but two are on the user's side. The user's actions seem justified because it's their home and they set the rules. But maybe there's a way to be more understanding if Jim felt his rights were being infringed. However, given the situation, the user's stance is about their own safety and comfort, so they're probably not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
