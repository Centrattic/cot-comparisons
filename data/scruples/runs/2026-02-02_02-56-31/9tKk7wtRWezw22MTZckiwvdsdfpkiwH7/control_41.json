We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author hosts a board game group at their house now, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author told Jim that they don't want any guns in their house, so Jim should leave his in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't exactly agreeing, and then later, when the author was in the kitchen, Jim told someone else he still had his gun with him. The author then kicked Jim out of the group, leading to Jim quitting. The rest of the group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that it's their house and they set the rules. They don't want guns in their home for safety reasons. That seems reasonable to me. People should be allowed to set boundaries in their own homes. Jim, on the other hand, had a concealed carry permit, which might mean he's legally allowed to carry in public places, but in a private home, the owner can set their own rules. So the author's stance is about personal safety and comfort.\n\nBut here's a twist: Jim might have felt that since he's licensed, he can carry in the group's usual meeting place, which was a hobby shop before. Maybe he didn't realize that the rules change when moving to a private residence. However, the author did communicate their rule to Jim before the first game night. Jim's response wasn't clear, but later actions showed he didn't comply. The author gave a warning before taking action, which is fair. \n\nSome might argue that the author overreacted because it's just one instance and maybe Jim didn't mean to break the rule. But the author's perspective is that this is a serious issue. They value safety and trust in their home. If someone doesn't follow a clear rule after being told, it's understandable to remove them to maintain the environment they want. \n\nThe group's mixed reactions show that there's no consensus, but the author's right to set rules in their home is a strong point. Legally, in many places, the homeowner can enforce a no guns policy in their residence. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They made their expectations clear, Jim didn't comply, and the author took action to protect their space. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like giving a second chance or discussing it further. But the situation involves personal safety, which is a valid concern. The author isn't being unreasonable for prioritizing their comfort and safety. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
