We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that they run a board game group, and after moving the meetings to their house, they told Jim he couldn't have the gun in the house. Jim didn't explicitly agree but then later mentioned to another member that he still had the gun with him when the user was out of the room. The user then told Jim he couldn't come back if he continued to do that. Now, the group is split on whether the user was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They own the house where the meetings are now held, so they have the right to set their own rules. Guns in the home can be a personal safety issue, especially if someone is anti-gun. The user made it clear they didn't want guns in their home, which is a reasonable request. The key point here is that Jim was carrying the gun on him, not just having it in the house. Concealed carry laws vary, but in many places, it's legal to carry a concealed gun in private residences with the owner's consent. However, the user didn't want him to carry it in their home, so if Jim didn't get permission to do so, that's a violation of the user's rules.\n\nBut there's a nuance. The user asked Jim to leave the gun in his truck, and he did so during the first session. Then, after the first session, when the user was in the kitchen, Jim still had the gun. The user's rule was about not having the gun in the house, but Jim had it on him. Depending on the state's concealed carry laws, if the user's home is considered a private residence and they didn't give explicit permission for Jim to carry it there, then Jim might be in violation. However, if the user's rule was about not having the gun in the house at all during the gatherings, and Jim had it on his person, that could still be against the user's stated rules, especially if they consider carrying it in their home as not respecting their boundary.\n\nThen there's the aspect of communication. The user told Jim privately before the first session. But Jim's initial response was acknowledging but not exactly affirming. Maybe he thought it was okay to carry it for some reason, or maybe he misunderstood. The user followed up after the first session when the issue occurred. They made it clear it was a serious matter, which is understandable. The user's point is that it's their house and their rules, which is a valid stance. People can choose to enforce their own boundaries in their personal space.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it was harsh but fair, others don't care, and one thinks the user was too uptight. That shows that people have different opinions, but the user's decision is about their own comfort and safety. It's not about being a shrew but about enforcing their own rules. The fact that Jim is now texting back and forth between leaving his number and sending propaganda might indicate he's not taking the user's boundaries seriously, which supports the user's position.\n\nLegally, the user can set the rules for their home. If they don't permit guns, and Jim respected that the first time but then brought it in again, the user has a right to ask him to leave. The user isn't wrong for doing so, especially if they felt disrespected by Jim bringing the gun in despite being asked. The main issue is whether the user's rule was clear and if Jim understood it. Since the user did communicate it before the event and then followed up after the incident, it seems like they were clear.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set their own rules in their home, and Jim's continued presence with a concealed weapon violates that. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
