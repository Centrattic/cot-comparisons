  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a hobby group that meets at someone's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The person in question (the host) told Jim he can't have his gun in the house. Jim agreed but later kept his gun with him when the host was away, leading the host to kick him out.\n\nFirst, the host says it's their house, so they have the right to set rules. That makes sense. People usually have the right to decide what's allowed in their home. Guns are a big deal, so the host's concern for safety is valid. Jim was carrying a gun despite being asked not to. Even if he had a permit, the host's rules should override that if it's their property.\n\nThen, the group's reactions are mixed. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh. But the host's main point is about safety and respect for their space. Jim didn't follow through on the agreement, which could be seen as disrespectful. The host addressed it right away, which is responsible. \n\nJim's response of not coming back isn't surprising if he doesn't want to comply with the host's rules. The host isn't forcing him to join, just enforcing house rules. The other members' opinions vary, but the host's decision is about their personal comfort and safety.\n\nSo, considering all that, the host isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries in their home, especially regarding something as serious as guns. The answer should be B.\n"
