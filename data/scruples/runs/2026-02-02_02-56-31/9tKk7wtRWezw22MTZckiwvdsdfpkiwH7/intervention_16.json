  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for asking Jim to leave their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. First, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nThe user owns their home and has the right to set rules about what's allowed there. Guns are a sensitive topic, especially in a private setting. The user made it clear beforehand that guns weren't allowed in their house. Jim had a concealed carry permit, but he brought the gun anyway, knowing the user's preference. The user took action after the first game night, which might seem strict, but it's their home.\n\nOn the other hand, Jim had a permit, so he might feel he's within his rights to carry. However, the user's rules apply in their own space. The user gave a warning first, which is reasonable. Others in the group have mixed reactions, but the key point is the user's right to their own property and safety.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. They communicated their rules, and when those were broken, they took action. It's about respecting personal boundaries in a private residence. So the answer should be B.\n"
