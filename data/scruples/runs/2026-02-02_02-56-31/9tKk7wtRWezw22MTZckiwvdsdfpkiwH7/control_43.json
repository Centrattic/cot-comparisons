We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he carried a concealed gun to their house.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The group meets regularly, moved to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author tells Jim privately that he can't have a gun in the house, so it needs to stay in his truck. Jim's response is non-committal. Later, another group member tells the author that Jim had his gun on him during the event when the author was away. The author then texts Jim, stating he's disrespectful and can't come back if he brings a gun. Jim quits the group. The group's reactions are mixed. The author's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules, considering the gun as a serious issue.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I need to consider the legality and the social norms. Legally, in the U.S., concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he can carry in public places, but private property owners can request firearms to be secured or not present. So, the author, as the host, can set rules for their home. Jim agreed to leave the gun in his truck initially but didn't comply after being reminded. The author's action of asking him to leave is within their rights.\n\nSocially, the author is enforcing their personal boundaries. The situation isn't about minor issues like bringing wrong snacks but a safety concern. The author addressed the issue after the first incident, which is reasonable. The mixed reactions from the group don't negate the author's right to set house rules. Jim's non-compliance led to the consequence of being asked to leave. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their comfort and safety in their own home.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
