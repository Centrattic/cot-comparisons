We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author hosts a board game group that's moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their house. Jim didn't clearly agree, but after the first game night, another member overheard Jim saying he had his gun with him when the author was away. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun, and Jim left the group. Some group members think it's fair, others think it's harsh.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are personal property rights and the author's comfort in their own home. The author set a clear rule beforehand, and Jim didn't comply. Even though Jim has a legal right to carry, the author is within their rights to set boundaries in their home. However, there's a split in the group, so maybe some see it as overreacting. But the author's stance is about safety and personal space. Legally, if the author doesn't want guns in their house, they can enforce that. The conflict here is more about personal values than legal wrongs. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's their house and they can set their rules. The answer would be B.\n"
