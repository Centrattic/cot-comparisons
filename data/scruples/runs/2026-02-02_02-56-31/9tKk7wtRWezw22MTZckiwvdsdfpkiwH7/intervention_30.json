We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person had a concealed gun. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: There's a board game group that moved to the user's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The user told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed in the house, so he should leave it in his truck. Jim didn't exactly agree, but after the first event, someone else found out that Jim had his gun with him during the game night. The user then told Jim he couldn't come back if he had a gun, leading to Jim leaving the group. The group's reactions are mixed, and now the user is being criticized by one member.\n\nThe user's stance is that it's their house and their rules, so not allowing a gun is reasonable. The other person's argument is that it's a bit harsh, especially since it's the first time and Jim had done it before without issues.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as the homeowner, the user has the right to set rules about what is allowed in their home. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if someone is licensed, they can carry in public places, but private property owners can restrict it. So the user is legally within their rights.\n\nEthically, it's a personal boundary. The user is uncomfortable with guns in their home, and that's a valid feeling. They addressed it upfront, but when the boundary was crossed, they took action. It's a matter of respecting personal space and safety. \n\nThe group's divided reactions make sense. Some might see it as necessary for the user to enforce their rules, others might think it's an overreaction. But given that the user made it clear beforehand, and the issue was about a safety concern (even if the user is anti-gun, the presence of a weapon in their home is a red line), enforcing that rule is understandable. \n\nJim's response of quitting is his choice, and the continued contact (texting back and forth) is his issue, not the user's fault. The user acted to maintain their own comfort and safety in their home. So I think the answer is B; they're not in the wrong.\n"
