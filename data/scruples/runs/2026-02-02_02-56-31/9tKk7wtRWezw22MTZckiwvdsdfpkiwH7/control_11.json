  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for asking Jim to leave their home because he was carrying a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun, and after finding out Jim had his gun with him during the game night, they kicked him out. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear beforehand that no guns were allowed in their house. Jim was given a heads-up and told to leave the gun in his truck. However, Jim didn't comply the first time. The author then followed up after the fact when another member informed them. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author set the rule in advance, Jim didn't follow it, and the author took action based on their own home rules. It's their house, so they have the right to establish safety guidelines. Jim's actions could be seen as a breach of trust or safety. But maybe the author could have handled it differently, like giving a warning first. However, the situation is about personal property and safety. The author isn't in the wrong if they set boundaries and enforce them.\n"
