We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author hosts a board game group at their house now, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author told Jim directly that they don't want guns in the house, so he should leave his in the truck. Jim didn't explicitly confirm, and later, when the author was out of earshot, Jim revealed to another member that he still had the gun with him. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he's armed, leading to Jim leaving.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to set rules for their own home versus Jim's right to carry a gun. In the U.S., concealed carry laws vary by state, but generally, if someone is licensed, they can carry in public places. However, private property owners typically have the right to prohibit guns on their premises. So the author's decision to not allow guns in their house is within their legal rights.\n\nJim's actions here were a direct violation of the rule the author set. The author gave a clear instruction, and Jim didn't follow it. The author then enforced the rule, which is reasonable. The other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily make the author wrong; they're just different opinions.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's nuance. Did Jim have a right to carry in the home? Well, the author made it clear that guns weren't allowed. If Jim was carrying in a place where the host specifically prohibited it, even if he's licensed, the host can enforce that. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B, No.\n"
