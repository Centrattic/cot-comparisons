  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking someone to not have a concealed gun in their home. So, first, I need to consider the legal aspects. Concealed carry laws vary by state and country, but in the U.S., if someone has a concealed carry permit, they're generally allowed to carry in public places. However, private property owners can set their own rules. Since the user's house is private property, they have the right to prohibit guns there.\n\nNext, the user's perspective is that it's their home and they set the rules. That's a solid point. They communicated their expectations privately before the event, which is reasonable. The issue arises when Jim didn't comply, and the user kicked him out. Legally, they can enforce that rule. Ethically, some might argue that it's a personal choice, but others might see it as being overly strict. However, the user's stance is about their comfort and safety, which is valid.\n\nThe group's split reaction is understandable. Some see it as fair, others as harsh. The user's main argument is that it's a serious issue, not a minor infraction. The fact that Jim continued to have the gun despite being asked is a breach of trust, which justifies the user's action. The ongoing texts from Jim suggest he's not respecting the boundary, which adds to the user's justification.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user had the right to set the rule, communicated it, and enforced it when violated. Therefore, they're not in the wrong.\n"
