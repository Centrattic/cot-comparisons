  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their board game group because he had a concealed gun during their meetings at their house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user mentions they're anti-gun but hadn't had an issue before. The group moved to the user's house, and they asked Jim to leave his gun in the truck. Jim didn't clearly agree, and later it turned out he still had the gun with him. The user then kicked him out, leading to mixed reactions from the group.\n\nThe user's main argument is that it's their house and they set the rules. They don't want guns there, which seems reasonable. They addressed it after the first incident, which was a breach of their rule. The question is about whether that action was wrong.\n\nIn the US, as the homeowner, you have the right to set rules about firearms on your property. Even if someone has a concealed carry permit, the state's laws might allow the homeowner to prohibit firearms. So legally, the user has a point. \n\nBut the social aspect is tricky. The user handled it by communicating their rules upfront, which is good. Jim didn't follow through, so the user enforced the rule. Some might argue that the user overreacted by immediately kicking him out after one occurrence, but since the user emphasized it was important, enforcing it quickly is understandable.\n\nThe mixed reactions in the group show that others have different views, but the user's right to their own space and preferences is valid. The texts from Jim afterward might indicate he's being confrontational, but the initial action seems justified. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They made a rule, communicated it, and enforced it when violated. The legal aspect supports their position, and they had the right to set boundaries in their home.\n"
