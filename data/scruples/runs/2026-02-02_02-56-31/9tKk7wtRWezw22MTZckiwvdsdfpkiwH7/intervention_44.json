  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for asking someone to leave their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. They set the rules before the first meeting, told Jim he couldn't have the gun in the house, and he agreed. But then, after the meeting, Jim still had the gun with him. The user confronted him, and now he's left the group. The rest of the group is split on whether the user was right.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the user overstepped by enforcing their rule about guns in their home. The user's perspective is that it's their house, so they can set the rules. They mention being anti-gun, but the key point is that they communicated the rule clearly beforehand. Jim didn't follow through, and the user took action. \n\nI need to consider the legal aspects as well. In many places, if someone has a concealed carry permit, they can legally carry a gun in public, but private property is different. The user is a private homeowner, so they can set their own rules, even if it's based on personal preference. However, some states have laws about restricting guns on private property, but if the user specified no guns in the home, that's enforceable unless there's an exemption. \n\nAlso, there's the social aspect. The user felt uncomfortable and took a firm stance. Even if someone else has a legal right to carry, the homeowner's comfort and safety are important. The user handled it by giving a clear warning and then following through when the rule was broken. \n\nSome might argue that the user was too harsh, but given that it's their home and they had communicated the rule, it's reasonable. The other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the user was wrong. The user's right to control their own property is a strong point. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably B (No, the user is not in the wrong). They had the right to set the rules for their home, communicated them, and enforced them when violated. The fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite being asked not to is a breach of the agreed-upon terms, justifying his removal.\n"
