We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that the author hosts game nights at their house and told Jim upfront that guns aren't allowed. Jim was carrying one, and when the author found out, they asked him to leave. The group is split on whether it was fair.\n\nFirst, the author made their stance clear before the event. They told Jim directly that guns aren't allowed in their home. That seems like a reasonable rule, especially since it's their house. The user is anti-gun, which is a personal right, but the main issue is about respecting the host's rules.\n\nJim didn't comply with the rule. Even though he mentioned he has a concealed carry permit, he was carrying the gun in the house despite being told otherwise. The author followed through on the rule after a warning. The other members' reactions are mixed, but the author's right to set boundaries in their own home is a key point here.\n\nThe user might be wondering if respecting the host's rules is more important than gun rights. Since the author clearly communicated the rule beforehand, and Jim violated it, the author isn't in the wrong. The fact that Jim kept texting with conflicting messages also shows he didn't take the rule seriously. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
