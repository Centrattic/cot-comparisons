  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking a group member to not bring a concealed gun to their house. They set up a hobby group that moved to their home, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The user told Jim upfront to leave his gun in the truck. Jim didn't comply, and the user kicked him out. The group is divided on whether this was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a permit, he's legally allowed to carry in public places, but private property can have rules. The user's house is private property, so they can set rules about guns. But maybe there's something about \"open carry\" vs. concealed? If the law allows concealed carry in private homes, then maybe the user can't enforce that. But if the law allows the property owner to prohibit guns, then the user is within their rights.\n\nNext, the user's right as the host. They mentioned it's their house and their rules. Even if Jim has a permit, the host can ask him to leave the gun outside. But if Jim was on the premises legally, and the user asked him to not bring the gun, and he didn't comply, the user can remove him for violating the house rules. However, if the law requires that a permit holder can carry in private homes unless prohibited, then the user might have gone too far.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The user is anti-gun, but they had to communicate clearly. They did tell Jim beforehand. Jim didn't follow through, so the user took action. The user's response was firm, which some might see as harsh, but others support. The key is whether the user had the authority to enforce that rule. If the user's house allows them to do that, then they're not in the wrong. If the user's actions were based on a misunderstanding of the law about gun ownership, then maybe they are in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the user's follow-up text to Jim was about being disrespectful. Maybe the user felt violated, but did they have a legal right to do that? If the user can legally restrict guns on their property, then they're not in the wrong. If not, maybe they were too hasty.\n\nAnother angle: some states have \"gun-free\" zones or specific laws about private property. Without knowing the state, it's a bit tricky, but generally, property owners can post signs and require no guns. However, in some states, permit holders can carry unless the property is a prohibited place (like schools, government buildings). If the user's home isn't a prohibited area, and the law allows the host to prohibit guns, then the user is okay.\n\nThe user's actions were to kick Jim out after he didn't comply. The user's reasoning is based on control over their property, which is a valid stance. Even if Jim feels it's his right to carry, the host can set boundaries. The user might not be in the wrong if the law supports their right to restrict guns at their home.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions show it's a contentious issue, but the user's position as the host gives them the authority. Unless the law prohibits the user from doing so, they are within their rights. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
