We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for asking a guy named Jim to leave their home game group because he had a concealed gun. So, they set the scene that they have a small group that's been meeting for six months, moved to their house because the shop wasn't great. They told Jim privately that he couldn't have his gun in the house, but he only kind of acknowledged it. Then after the first meeting, someone told them Jim still had his gun there. The user then texted him saying it was disrespectful and he couldn't come anymore. Jim quit the group. The rest of the group is split in their opinions.\n\nFirst, the user is asserting that it's their house, so they can set the rules. They don't want guns in their home, which they think is a reasonable rule. They felt it was important enough to kick someone out over. The user's argument is that it's about safety and personal boundaries. \n\nJim had a concealed carry permit, so he's legally allowed to carry a gun, but the user's home is a private space. The user made their stance clear beforehand, but Jim didn't comply. The user then followed up after the incident, which led to Jim leaving. The user is being accused by some in the group of being too uptight, but others think it's fair. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, in the US, even if someone has a concealed carry permit, the homeowner can request that the gun be left outside the home. So the user isn't violating any laws by asking the gun to be left outside. So from a legal standpoint, the user isn't in the wrong.\n\nEthically, it's about personal boundaries. The user made their preference known. Jim didn't follow it, which the user found disrespectful. Since Jim chose to carry the gun into the house despite the request, the user enforced their rule. It's reasonable for someone to not want guns in their home for safety or comfort reasons, especially if they're anti-gun. The user addressed it directly and only after a violation. So ethically, it's a personal choice. \n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it's harsh but fair, others not. But the user's reasoning is that safety and respect for their space were at stake. The user didn't just kick Jim out immediately; they gave him a warning first. The fact that Jim continued to carry the gun after being asked is a breach of the user's rules. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is not in the wrong. They have the right to their own home rules, and they communicated them. Jim didn't comply, so the user had to enforce it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
