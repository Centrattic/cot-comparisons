We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they made it clear they didn't want guns in their house. Jim had a concealed carry permit and carried a gun, which the author found out about before the first game night at their home. The author told Jim privately that he needed to leave the gun in his truck. Jim's response was non-committal. Then, after the first session, another member told the author that Jim still had the gun on him when the author was out of the room. The author then sent Jim a text saying he was disrespectful and couldn't come again if he brought a gun. Jim quit the group. The reactions from others are mixed, with some thinking it's harsh but fair, others not caring, and one thinking the author was too uptight.\n\nSo, the key points here are: it's the author's house, they set the rules upfront, and Jim didn't comply. The author gave a clear rule and Jim didn't follow it. The author is anti-gun, which is their personal preference, but they have the right to enforce their own house rules. The other members' mixed reactions might indicate that some see the author's stance as reasonable, while others think it's an overreaction. However, the core issue is about respecting the host's boundaries. Since the author made their rules known and Jim didn't adhere, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
