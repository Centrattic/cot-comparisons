  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for asking someone to leave their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. They set up the situation where they moved game nights to their house and made it clear they didn't want guns there. The guy, Jim, had a concealed carry permit and initially said he'd leave his gun in the truck. But later, someone else told the user that Jim still had the gun with him when they weren't around. The user then told Jim he couldn't come if he had the gun, and Jim quit. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, the user's stance is about their own home rules. They don't want guns in their house, which is a personal right. They addressed the issue privately first, which is a reasonable step. Then when they found out Jim wasn't complying, they enforced their rule. The user's reasoning is that it's their house, and this is a serious matter, not a trivial one like snacks.\n\nJim's response was to quit, which he did. The user isn't kicking people out for minor issues; it's a safety-related rule. The other group members are split, but some side with the user. The key here is whether the user overstepped. Since it's their home, they have the right to set boundaries. Even if Jim had a permit, the user isn't required to allow him to carry in their private residence. The user's action was about enforcing a personal boundary, not about Jim's rights in public spaces. The continued communication from Jim seems to be his issue, not necessarily the user's.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, they're not wrong). The user is within their rights to set rules for their home, especially regarding safety. Jim's decision to leave is his choice, not the user's wrongdoing.\n"
