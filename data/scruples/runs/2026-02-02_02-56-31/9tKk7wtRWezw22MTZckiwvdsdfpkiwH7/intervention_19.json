  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they were wrong to kick someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. First, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The user is anti-gun, and they made it clear they don't want guns in their house. They had a private conversation with Jim, telling him to leave the gun in his truck. But Jim still kept it with him during the game night, which the user found out later.\n\nNow, the user's main argument is that it's their house and they set the rules. They felt it was a serious issue and addressed it immediately. On the other hand, Jim might argue that he has a concealed carry permit and it's his right to carry, especially in public places. But the user's home is a private space, so state laws might allow or restrict guns in private residences differently. However, even if allowed, the host can set their own rules.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it's fair, others not. But the user's point is about their own right to enforce rules in their home. Legally, in many places, the host can ask someone to leave if they violate house rules. So, from a legal standpoint, the user isn't in the wrong. Ethically, it's a personal choice. The user isn't forcing Jim to attend; they're just saying that if he does, he must follow the rules. Jim chose to leave after being told, so it's a mutual decision.\n\nAlso, Jim's continued texting after being asked to leave might be seen as pestering, which is another issue. But the original action was about enforcing the no guns policy. The user didn't kick him out publicly; they gave him a warning first. So, the answer would likely be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
