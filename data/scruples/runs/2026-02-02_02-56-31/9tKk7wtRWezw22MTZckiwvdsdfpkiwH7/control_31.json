We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is part of a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim not to bring guns into the house, and Jim didn't confirm he would comply. After the first game night, another member told the author that Jim had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit. The group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, the author's stance is about safety in their own home. They're anti-gun, which is a personal belief, but the main issue here is about setting boundaries in their house. The author gave a clear rule beforehand, but Jim didn't clearly agree. Then, he didn't follow the rule during the event, which the author considered disrespectful. The author then enforced their rule by asking him to leave the group if he continued. \n\nNow, considering the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but in places where it's legal, individuals can carry guns in public and private spaces unless prohibited. However, the author is the host of their home, so they have the right to establish their own policies. Even if Jim has a permit, the author can decide not to allow guns in their house. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that rule.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is at fault morally or socially. The author gave a warning before the event, but Jim didn't confirm. Then, during the event, he didn't follow through. The author took immediate action, which some might see as harsh, but the author's perspective is that it's their house and a serious matter. The group's mixed reactions might indicate that some see the author's actions as reasonable and others as overly strict. However, the fact that one member didn't care and another thought it was fair suggests that the author isn't entirely off base.\n\nJim's response was to quit, which he did. The author's action was to enforce their rule, which is about personal comfort and safety. Even if Jim felt it was a minor issue (like wrong snacks), to the author, it's a significant matter of safety. The author isn't forcing Jim to attend; they're just enforcing their home rules. The back-and-forth texting from Jim might indicate he felt wronged, but that doesn't negate the author's right to set boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their home's rules, especially regarding something as personal and sensitive as guns. The key here is the host's authority over their space. The answer should be B (No).\n"
