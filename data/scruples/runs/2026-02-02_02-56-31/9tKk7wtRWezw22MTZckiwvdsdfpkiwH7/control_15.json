We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author has a board game group that meets at their house now. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed in the house, expecting him to leave it in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't fully affirming. Then, during the first game night, Jim told another member he still had his gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then texted Jim, saying he was disrespectful and couldn't come if he had a gun. Jim quit the group. The group has mixed reactions, and Jim is still texting the author with conflicting messages.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal property rights and safety. The author's house is their own, so they have the right to set rules for their home. The issue is whether it's reasonable to prohibit guns on private property. In many places, as long as the property owner is not a felon and complies with local laws, they can set such rules. So the author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave his gun in the truck. Jim's insistence on having the gun on the premises despite being told otherwise is a violation of the host's rules.\n\nThe author's action was to enforce their own rules, which is their right. Jim could have chosen not to attend if he couldn't comply. The author didn't act out of malice but to ensure their home is safe according to their comfort. The other group members have mixed feelings, but the author's stance is based on personal safety and control over their space.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might think it's an overreaction since Jim has a permit and is lawfully carrying. However, private property rights often override concealed carry laws. The author isn't banning guns in general but enforcing their own home rules, which is within their rights. Also, the situation escalated quickly, but the author addressed it after the first incident, which shows they took it seriously without prior issues.\n\nAnother angle: Could there be a misunderstanding in communication? The author asked Jim privately, and Jim's response wasn't explicit. But the author got confirmation from another member that Jim had the gun on him, leading to the decision. The author's follow-up message was clear, and Jim's response was to leave. The author isn't in the wrong here because they communicated their rules, enforced them after a breach, and it's their home.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
