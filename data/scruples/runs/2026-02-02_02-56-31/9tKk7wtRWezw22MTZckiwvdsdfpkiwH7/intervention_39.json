  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. They have a board game group that moved to their house. Jim has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he carries a gun. The user told him upfront that guns aren't allowed in their house. After the first game night, someone told them Jim had the gun with him while they were out. The user then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun, leading to Jim quitting. The reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user was right to set that rule. It's their house, so they have the right to set boundaries. Guns can be a sensitive topic, and the user is anti-gun. They clearly communicated their expectations beforehand. Jim didn't follow through, which the user saw as disrespectful. They addressed it after the fact, which makes sense because it's a safety issue. The other group members have different opinions, but the user's stance is about their personal comfort and safety in their home. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did Jim actually break any laws? Concealed carry is legal in many places, so if he was compliant with the law, maybe. But the user's house is private property, so they can set their own rules. The user gave a clear warning and then followed through when the rule was broken. It's about consent and safety. The user isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own space. The answer would be B, No.\n"
