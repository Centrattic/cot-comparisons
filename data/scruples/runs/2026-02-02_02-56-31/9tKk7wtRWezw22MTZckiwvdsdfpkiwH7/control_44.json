We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: The group meets at the author's house now. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed, and Jim was supposed to leave his gun in the truck. Jim didn't comply and had the gun on him during the session. The author then banned him.\n\nThe key points here are about personal property and safety. The author's house, their rules. They had a clear rule set before the event. Jim didn't follow it, so the author enforced the rule. The author's stance is that it's their right to have a safe space without guns.\n\nBut wait, there's a nuance. Jim has a concealed carry permit, which is legal in many places. So, does that mean Jim has a right to carry even in private homes? It depends on local laws. If the author's house isn't a prohibited place for concealed carry, then Jim might not have done anything illegal. However, the author is the host and can set their own policies. Even if it's legal, the host can choose to ban guns on their property.\n\nThe other group members are split. Some think it's harsh but fair, others think the author was too uptight. But the author's main argument is about safety and personal boundaries. They made the rule clear before the event, and Jim didn't follow through. So the author followed through on their stated policy.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Like giving Jim a second chance or discussing it more before banning him. But given the situation, the author felt it was a serious issue and acted accordingly. The fact that Jim continued to contact the author with conflicting messages after being banned might indicate he didn't take the rule seriously, which reinforces the author's decision.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. It's their house, they made the rules, Jim didn't follow them. The answer should be B (No).\n"
