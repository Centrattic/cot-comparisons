We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that the group now meets at the author's house, and the author made it clear they don't want guns in their home. Jim had a concealed carry permit and brought his gun, which the author found out about after the first meeting. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, leading to Jim leaving.\n\nFirst, the key points here are ownership of the house and personal rules. The author states it's their house and their rules. In many places, as a homeowner, you have the right to set conditions for who can enter your property, including not allowing weapons. So legally, the author can ask someone to leave if they're carrying a gun, unless there are specific laws that protect concealed carry in private homes. However, since Jim has a concealed carry permit, he might have a legal right to carry in public, but private property is different. The author is not obligated to allow someone with a gun into their home if they're uncomfortable.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is anti-gun and felt it was a serious issue. They communicated their boundaries clearly initially, and when Jim didn't follow through, they enforced the rule. The author's action is about personal safety and comfort. Even if Jim's actions were legal, the host's right to set their own rules is important in a social setting. The reactions of the group split, but that's common in such situations. The author's firm stance is understandable given that it's their home and a potential safety concern. Jim's continued texting might just be him expressing frustration rather than the author being in the wrong. The main issue is about personal boundaries, and the author has the right to enforce them. So the answer is B.\n"
