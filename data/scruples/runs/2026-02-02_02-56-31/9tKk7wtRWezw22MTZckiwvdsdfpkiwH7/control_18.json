We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is hosting a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. The author told Jim before the first meeting at their home that they don't want guns there, and that he should leave his in the truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't fully affirming. Later, the author found out that Jim had his gun during a session when they were in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe key points here are about personal property rights and safety. The author is in their own home, so they have the right to set rules about what's allowed there. Guns can be a sensitive topic, especially since the author is anti-gun. Even though Jim had a permit, in the author's home, the host can decide whether firearms are allowed. \n\nThe author gave a warning beforehand, so Jim was aware. Even if Jim felt he had the right to carry, the host's rules take precedence in their own home. The author's decision to enforce that rule after Jim violated it seems reasonable. The fact that Jim continued to carry despite being told not to could be seen as a breach of trust or respect. \n\nThe reactions from the group are split, but that's not uncommon. One person thought it was harsh, but another said it was fair. The author's stance is about their personal space and safety. Since it's their house, they aren't in the wrong for enforcing that rule. Also, Jim's continued texting back and forth with links and threats of removing his number might indicate he feels wronged, but that doesn't negate the author's right to their own space. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are within their rights to set rules for their home, especially regarding firearms, and they did address the issue after a prior warning.\n"
