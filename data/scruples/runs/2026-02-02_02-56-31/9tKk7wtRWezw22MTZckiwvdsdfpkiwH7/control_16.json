We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author hosts a board game group. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun to the game nights. The author, being anti-gun, told Jim privately before moving to their house that guns aren't allowed. Jim supposedly acknowledged but didn't confirm. Then, during the first house meeting, Jim had the gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author found out through another member, then told Jim he couldn't come back. Jim left the group. The group reactions are mixed. The author is being criticized by one member for being too strict.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries, right? The author made it clear that their house is no guns. Jim either didn't take it seriously or misunderstood. The author acted when the rule was broken. Legally, in the US, the homeowner can set rules about their property, including no guns. Depending on the state, even if Jim has a concealed carry permit, the owner can restrict guns on their premises. So legally, the author is probably in the right.\n\nEthically, it's about respecting someone's home. If you're invited into someone's home, you should follow their rules. Jim brought a gun despite being told not to. The author had a right to enforce their space. The fact that Jim continued to text with propaganda might show he's not taking the author's boundaries seriously, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe other members have mixed reactions, but that's normal in group settings. The author's stance is about safety and comfort in their own home. Even if some see it as harsh, the author's right to their space is a strong point. The problem here is not about the author being wrong but about differing opinions on personal boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're asserting their right to control their home environment. Jim violated a clear rule, and the author took appropriate action.\n"
