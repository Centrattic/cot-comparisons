Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their dad, who was abusive to their older brother Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The dad mellowed out after the author was born, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18, and now the dad has died. The author and their mom are trying to plan the funeral but Jeff is refusing to help, and when the author confronted Jeff, he got angry.\n\nThe author asked if they're in the wrong for telling Jeff he has an obligation to help with the funeral for their mom's sake. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. They went to Jeff's place to convince him. Jeff's reaction was harsh, but his reasoning is that the dad was abusive to him. So the question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff to help.\n\nOn one hand, the author might think that family obligations are important, and that Jeff should put aside past trauma to help with the funeral. But on the other hand, Jeff has legitimate reasons for not wanting to participate. Abuse can have long-lasting effects, and forcing someone to take part in a funeral for someone who harmed them could be triggering or disrespectful to their feelings.\n\nThe author might not have considered that Jeff's trauma is valid and that he has the right to set boundaries. By saying Jeff has an obligation, the author might be dismissing his experiences and the emotional burden he carries. The author's approach could have been more empathetic, understanding Jeff's perspective first before trying to convince him.\n\nBut the author also mentions that their mom is upset, so there's a balance between respecting Jeff's feelings and supporting the mom. However, the decision to attend a funeral is personal. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but perhaps the way they framed it as an \"obligation\" without considering Jeff's trauma is where the issue lies.\n\nSo, the author's intent was good, but the approach might have been flawed. They might not be in the wrong entirely, but maybe there's room for understanding that Jeff's choice is valid. The question is whether the author's action of insisting on Jeff's help was wrong. Since Jeff has a right to decline due to his past, the author might be partially in the wrong for not respecting that initially.\n"
