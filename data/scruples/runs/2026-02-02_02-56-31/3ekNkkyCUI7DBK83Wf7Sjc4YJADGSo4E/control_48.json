Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me.

Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, especially when drinking. After the author was born, the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff moved out when he was 18, left the situation, and hasn't looked back. Now the dad is dead, and the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, saying he doesn't want to help because of the past abuse. The author is torn between supporting mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author wrong for telling Jeff he should help?\n\nHmm. Let's think about obligations. Family obligations can be tricky, especially after abuse. Jeff's experience with his father was traumatic. If someone was abused, is it wrong for them to not want to participate in honoring the abuser's funeral? The author might think Jeff has a duty to family, but Jeff's trauma could override that. The author's intention was to help mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough. \n\nThe author told Jeff he's making their mom upset and called him a dick for not helping. That might have come off as judgmental. Jeff's reaction was defensive, which makes sense if he's hurt and angry. The author's approach might have been confrontational, not empathetic. Maybe instead of telling Jeff he has an obligation, the author should have discussed how to support mom without putting pressure on Jeff, given his history. \n\nAlso, the author went to Jeff's house uninvited, possibly to convince him, which could be seen as overstepping if Jeff wasn't expecting that. The author might not have considered Jeff's right to disengage from the situation. However, the author's concern for mom is valid. There's a balance between respecting Jeff's feelings and trying to help mom. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions could be seen as not respecting Jeff's boundaries. Jeff's trauma is real, and the author's approach might have been insensitive. The author is in the middle, but pushing Jeff to participate might not be fair. On the other hand, trying to mediate is a good intention, but the method was flawed. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer is probably B (No), but let me check. If the author's action was well-intentioned but the approach was wrong, then maybe they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, if they had the right to tell Jeff he has an obligation, considering the past, then maybe they are. \n\nBut given that Jeff was abused, expecting him to help could be seen as invalidating his trauma. The author might not have considered that. So the answer could be A (Yes), if the author was inconsiderate. Wait, the author's mom is upset, so they tried to help her. But maybe they should have handled it differently. \n\nIn the end, the author's intention was good, but the execution might have been wrong. The key is whether Jeff has an obligation despite the abuse. If the author pressured Jeff without considering his trauma, that's where they went wrong. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe yes. So answer A? But I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck.\n\nThe author says Jeff has an obligation. Jeff was abused. Obligations can be family-based, but if the person was abusive, maybe the obligation isn't there. The author's statement that Jeff has an obligation might be the issue. So the author is wrong for assuming that obligation exists without considering Jeff's past. Therefore, answer A. But some might argue that family still has obligations regardless. But in this case, Jeff's trauma is significant. So the author is wrong. So answer A.\n"
