Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he should help with their father's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff when he was younger. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now, after the dad's death, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive, so Jeff's resentment is understandable. The user's mom wants closure, but Jeff has no obligation to participate if he doesn't want to. The user tried to mediate, but Jeff's reaction was hostile. The question is whether the user was wrong in pushing Jeff to help.\n\nFactors to consider: Did the user overstep by imposing their mom's wishes on Jeff? Jeff has his own reasons for not wanting to be involved. The user's intention was to help Mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's trauma. However, is there a moral obligation to attend a parent's funeral regardless of past? It's a sensitive area. In some cultures, there's expectation, but personally, it's more about individual choice. The user might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but maybe they should have been more empathetic towards Jeff's feelings. Alternatively, maybe Jeff is within his rights to not participate, and the user's approach was too confrontational. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the user was trying to help their mom, but also maybe A (in the wrong) for not respecting Jeff's autonomy. It's a bit of a grey area. The key points are the user's intent versus Jeff's rights. Since Jeff was abusive, the user might have a valid point in wanting the family to come together, but they might have pushed too hard without understanding Jeff's trauma. Hmm. Maybe the user isn't in the wrong because they acted out of concern for their mom, but they could have handled it more gently. The answer is likely B.\n"
