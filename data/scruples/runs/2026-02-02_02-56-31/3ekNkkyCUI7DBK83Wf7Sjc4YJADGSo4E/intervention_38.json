Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they did the wrong thing by telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves a lot of family dynamics, especially with a history of abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's perspective. Jeff had a really bad experience with their dad, physical abuse, drunk, yelling. He moved out as soon as he could and hasn't been in contact. The user, being the younger sibling, didn't experience the same level of abuse. Their mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral planning. The user went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help because of the past trauma. \n\nSo, the user is torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's reasons. The question is whether the user was wrong to pressure Jeff. \n\nFrom one angle, family obligations can be important, especially for the mother's sake. But Jeff has valid reasons to not want to be involved, given the abuse. The user's approach might have been too direct, using words like \"needs to stop being such a dick,\" which could have been insensitive. Maybe the user should have approached it with more empathy, acknowledging Jeff's pain first before asking for help. \n\nOn the other hand, the user was trying to help their mom, which is a good intention. But they might not have considered Jeff's emotional state. The key points are: the history of abuse, the user's lack of understanding of Jeff's trauma, and the method used to approach Jeff. \n\nSo, the user might not be entirely wrong, but their approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they tried to mediate without understanding the depth of Jeff's feelings, maybe they are partially at fault. But considering Jeff's valid reasons, maybe the user is not wrong. \n\nHmm, hard to say. I think the answer is B, they are not in the wrong. They had good intentions, even if the execution was flawed. Jeff's refusal is understandable. The user's role was to communicate their mom's feelings, which is a valid family responsibility. The main issue is that the user didn't handle it with enough empathy, but that doesn't make them wrong. So, B.\n"
