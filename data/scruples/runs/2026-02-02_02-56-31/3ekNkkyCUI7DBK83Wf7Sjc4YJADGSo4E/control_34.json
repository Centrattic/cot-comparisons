Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother to help with the funeral of their abusive father. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father was abusive towards Jeff, the older brother, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now the father died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has valid reasons not to want to be part of the funeral due to past abuse. The author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through since they weren't present for that. The brother's refusal isn't about money or obligation but emotional reasons. \n\nWas the author wrong in assuming Jeff has an obligation? Well, family obligations can be complex, especially in cases of abuse. The author might have thought that despite the past, Jeff should help for mom's sake. However, forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive could be traumatic. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a healthy boundary.\n\nAlso, the way the author approached Jeff (telling him he's being a dick) could have been confrontational. Maybe the author should have tried a more empathetic approach, understanding Jeff's perspective first before insisting. \n\nBut then again, the author was trying to mediate between Jeff and their mom. The mom is grieving, and the author wanted to support her. However, the key point is whether the author had the right to impose this on Jeff. Since Jeff has his own reasons, the author might not be in the wrong, but they might have misjudged the situation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is right to want the family to come together, but they didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough. It's a balance between respecting Jeff's boundaries and Mom's wishes. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author acted with good intentions but might have overlooked Jeff's trauma. However, their main goal was to help their mom, which is understandable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help but could have handled it more sensitively.\n"
