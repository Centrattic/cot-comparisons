Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic with abuse from the father, Jeff's resentment, and the mother's distress.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drinking, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't reconciled, while the author stayed. Now that the dad died, the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral, and the author tried to mediate by telling Jeff he should help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry, accused the author of not understanding his trauma, and refuses to help.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to help Mom, but Jeff's refusal is rooted in past trauma. The author might have thought Jeff had an obligation, but Jeff's stance is based on personal history.\n\nIn terms of morality, obligations can be subjective. While family duties are often expected, Jeff's trauma might make participation impossible. The author's approach was confrontational, which Jeff took as invalidating his feelings. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help Mom, but maybe could have handled it more empathetically. However, the question is if they're in the wrong for telling Jeff he has an obligation. Since Jeff has valid reasons to refuse, the author might be wrong to impose that obligation. But the author's intent was good. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author tried to mediate for Mom's well-being, but maybe could have approached it differently. The key is that Jeff isn't obligated to help if he has trauma. The author's statement might have been misguided, but the intent was good. So the answer is B.\n"
