Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially towards Jeff, but mellowed out after the user was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused. The user is torn between their mom's feelings and Jeff's justified anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Jeff was abused by their dad, so he might have valid reasons to distance himself. The user's mom is grieving and might need support from both children. The user tried to mediate, but Jeff's response was hostile.\n\nIs the user wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Well, family obligations can be complex. On one hand, funerals are traditionally family affairs, but Jeff's trauma might make it difficult. The user might have a point in trying to encourage Jeff for their mom's sake, but they might have overstepped by implying an obligation.\n\nThe user's approach might have been confrontational. Instead of telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" maybe a more empathetic approach could have worked. However, the user's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. Jeff's anger is also justified given his past. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It's a tough call. They might not be entirely wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but they might have handled it poorly. However, the key point is that they pushed Jeff to do something he's not comfortable with, given his history. So maybe the answer is that they are in the wrong (A) because they imposed an obligation without considering Jeff's trauma.\n"
