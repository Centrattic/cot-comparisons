Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive father. The situation involves family dynamics with a lot of past abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother, Jeff, has a history of abuse from their dad. The author, who is younger, wasn't around when the abuse was severe because their dad mellowed out after the author was born. Now that the dad is dead, the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place and told him he should help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry and refuses.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The author's argument is that Jeff has a duty to help, especially for Mom's well-being. Jeff's argument is that he has valid reasons not to participate because of the abuse. \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, family obligations can be strong, especially when it comes to respecting a parent's passing and supporting the mother. On the other hand, Jeff's trauma from the abuse is real and significant. The author is trying to mediate between the mother's needs and Jeff's refusal, but Jeff's refusal is based on justified pain.\n\nIs the author wrong for insisting that Jeff help? If Jeff has legitimate reasons to not participate, perhaps the author shouldn't have pushed him. However, the author's intention was to support their mother, which is understandable. The line between respecting Jeff's boundaries and fulfilling familial duties is blurry here.\n\nAlso, the author didn't force Jeff but was trying to convince him. Jeff's response was hostile, but that might be due to his unresolved trauma. The author's approach was to appeal to Jeff's sense of duty for their mother, which might not be fair if Jeff is still hurt. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's feelings adequately. However, Jeff's right to refuse is valid. So the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author's intention was to support their mom, and it's not entirely their fault Jeff refused. The author tried to mediate but Jeff had his own reasons. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to ask, even if the outcome wasn't what they hoped.\n"
