Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the main question is about whether it's right to tell their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking, and Jeff moved out as soon as he could. The brother, Jeff, hasn't helped with the funeral. The person went to talk to Jeff and told him he needed to help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused. Now the person is wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nOn one side, the person is trying to help their mom who's upset. They probably felt Jeff should contribute because it's their family, and maybe they think it's important to honor their mom's wishes. On the other side, Jeff has a valid reason to be upset with the dad. The abuse was real, and he might not want to participate in a funeral for someone who was so harmful to him. \n\nThe person's argument is that even though Jeff went through that, he should help for Mom's sake. But Jeff's reaction shows that he feels the person doesn't understand his pain. The person might not be in the right because they didn't consider Jeff's feelings and history. They might have assumed Jeff had no right to refuse, not realizing how deep his resentment runs. \n\nAlso, the person might not have the authority to make Jeff feel obligated. It's possible that Jeff's decision to not participate is his own, based on his past. The person's approach could have been more understanding, offering support instead of demanding help. \n\nBut then again, the person was trying to support their mom, which is a good intention. However, the way they approached Jeff might have been too confrontational. It's a tough balance. Maybe the person isn't entirely in the wrong because they wanted to help their mom, but they could have handled it better. \n\nIn the end, whether they're in the wrong depends on how the situation is viewed. If Jeff's choice is seen as a personal matter, then the person might be wrong to push. But if the person was just trying to help their mom, maybe they're not. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their intention was to support their mom, but there's nuance here.\n"
