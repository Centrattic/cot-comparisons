Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Their dad was abusive, especially to Jeff when he was younger. He drank a lot, was violent and yelling. After the author was born, he mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18, didn't look back. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff, told him he should help for Mom's sake, and Jeff got angry, refused to help. The author is now wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nSo the main points here: Jeff had a bad experience with their dad, which is valid. The author is trying to help their mom by getting Jeff involved, but Jeff doesn't want to. The author is caught between Mom and Jeff's feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to help Mom, which is understandable. They were trying to reconcile the family during a difficult time. But Jeff has legitimate reasons not to want to participate in the funeral. Abuse is serious, and forcing someone to be part of a funeral for someone who hurt them isn't right. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they're pressuring Jeff to take part in something he's not comfortable with. Even though the author's motives are good, they might not have considered Jeff's trauma. However, if the author is trying to support Mom's emotional needs, there's a balance. But ultimately, each person has the right to decide their involvement. \n\nThe key is whether the author had the authority to tell Jeff he had an obligation. Since Jeff has a valid reason to want no part in the funeral, the author shouldn't impose that obligation on him. The author might have acted out of good intentions but didn't respect Jeff's boundaries. \n\nSo the answer is probably A (author is in the wrong), because they didn't consider Jeff's valid feelings and pushed for something he wasn't ready to do. It's not right to make someone participate in a funeral if they don't want to, especially after abuse. The author should have focused on supporting Mom without forcing Jeff's involvement.\n"
