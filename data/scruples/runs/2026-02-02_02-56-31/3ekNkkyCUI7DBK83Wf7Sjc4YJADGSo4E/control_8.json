Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The author, the younger sibling, wasn't subjected to the same level of abuse. The dad mellowed out after the author was born, maybe because he got sober. Now the dad has died, and they're planning the funeral. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, so the author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help. But Jeff got angry and refused, saying he won't help because of the abuse he went through. The author hasn't told their mom yet and is conflicted between supporting her and understanding Jeff's position.\n\nThe question is whether the author did the wrong thing by asking Jeff to contribute. Let me think about the key points here.\n\nOn one side, the author is trying to help their mom, who is grieving and upset. The author might feel that it's important for the family to come together, even if the dad was abusive. The author might believe that, despite the past, it's about honoring the family and respecting their mom's feelings.\n\nOn the other side, Jeff has reasons to be upset. The dad was abusive to him, and the author acknowledges that. Jeff's trauma from the abuse could be a valid reason for him to not want to participate in the funeral. The author might not fully understand Jeff's pain, especially since the dad was kinder to them. The author's approach might come off as dismissive of Jeff's feelings, which could make Jeff feel pressured and angry.\n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved, but they didn't consider whether Jeff is even willing or able to participate. The author might not have realized that Jeff's refusal is rooted in his own trauma. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and his right to choose not to help with the funeral.\n\nBut wait, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The mom is suffering, and maybe the author thought it was important to support her. However, the author didn't take into account Jeff's perspective and the fact that he might not want to reconnect with the family over a funeral for someone who hurt him. The author's approach was to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which could be seen as imposing their will without understanding Jeff's reasons. That obligation might not exist in Jeff's eyes, especially given the dad's behavior.\n\nAnother angle: family obligations can be complex. While the author might believe that contributing to the funeral is a shared responsibility, Jeff might see it as contributing to the memory of someone who was abusive. The author didn't acknowledge that Jeff's feelings are valid and might not have approached the situation with empathy. Instead of trying to convince Jeff, maybe the author should have supported Jeff's choice and helped the mom find other solutions, like handling the funeral without Jeff's involvement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's perspective and his right to make his own decision about participating in the funeral. The author's approach was to push Jeff to help without understanding his trauma, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
