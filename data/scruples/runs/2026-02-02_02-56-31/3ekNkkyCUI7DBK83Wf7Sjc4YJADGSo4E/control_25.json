Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their dad's funeral. The author's brother, Jeff, didn't want to help with the funeral because their dad was abusive when Jeff was younger. The author told Jeff he has an obligation to help for their mom's sake, and Jeff got really angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff, so Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. The author, on the other hand, wasn't subjected to the same treatment, so maybe they don't fully understand Jeff's feelings. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author tried to mediate.\n\nIs the author wrong for telling Jeff he should help? Well, the author's intention was to support their mom. But maybe they didn't consider that Jeff's trauma is real. The author might not have the right to impose their own feelings of obligation onto Jeff, especially given their different experiences with their dad. Families can have different perspectives, and forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them could be traumatic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that family obligations are important. But if Jeff doesn't want to do it, is it the author's place to tell him he has to? The key here is whether the author overstepped by not respecting Jeff's feelings and trauma. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. Even though Jeff has his reasons, the author was trying to help their mom. However, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author's action was to mediate and support their mom, and not forcing Jeff to attend, maybe they're not wrong. But wait, the author told Jeff he has an obligation, which might not be fair. The obligation part might be where the author is wrong. So maybe A? Hmm. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's action was to tell Jeff that he has an obligation to help. If Jeff doesn't feel that obligation due to his experiences, then maybe the author was wrong to pressure him. So maybe A is correct. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. \n\nThe author's mom is upset, and the author is trying to help. But Jeff's trauma is real. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but the way they approached it by stating obligation might be wrong. The answer is probably B, because the author isn't in the wrong for trying to help their mom, even if the approach was flawed. But maybe the answer is A because the author didn't respect Jeff's boundaries. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's action was to tell Jeff he must help. If Jeff's reasons are valid, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that. So answer A. But I'm still torn. Let me check the original post again. The author's main point is that they understand why Jeff doesn't want to help but still told him he should. The key is that the author is caught between mom and Jeff. Maybe the author isn't wrong because they're trying to help their mom, but they might not have the authority to make Jeff help. However, the answer is A if the author overstepped. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They had good intentions and were following their mom's request. Even if Jeff is upset, the author isn't wrong for trying to make him help. But maybe they are wrong because they forced the issue. I'm not sure. Let me think of it this way: family obligations can vary, and if Jeff doesn't want to participate, the author's insistence might not be right. So maybe A. \n\nBut I think the correct answer here is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, even if the approach could be better. The question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether their approach was perfect. So the answer is B.\n"
