Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff to help with their dad's funeral. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, their dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the user was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the dad is dead, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user went to Jeff and told him he needs to help for Mom's sake, which led to Jeff getting angry and refusing.\n\nSo the key points are: the dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, which is why Jeff is resistant. The user is caught between supporting Mom's emotional needs and understanding Jeff's trauma. The user's action was to confront Jeff, expecting him to participate in the funeral, which Jeff refuses.\n\nNow, considering obligations, family dynamics, and emotional impact. The user might feel Jeff has a duty to help, especially for the mom. But Jeff's trauma from the dad's abuse could make it hard for him to participate. The user's approach might have been heavy-handed, not considering Jeff's feelings. However, the user's intent was to help their mom, which is valid. \n\nIs the user wrong? Well, they might not have considered Jeff's perspective enough. But they weren't attacking Jeff; they were trying to mediate. However, telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" might be pushing him to do something he's not ready for, especially given the history. So maybe the user is in a tough spot, but their intent is good. The answer might depend on cultural expectations around family responsibilities versus personal trauma. In some views, family obligations are strong, but others prioritize individual well-being. Since the user is between two sides, it's a complex situation. But the user might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom while acknowledging Jeff's past. However, maybe they should have approached it differently. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the user was trying to help and their mom is important. Jeff's refusal is his choice, and the user's intervention was to encourage participation, not force it. The user isn't the one refusing; Jeff is. So the user's action was to bridge the gap, which is reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
