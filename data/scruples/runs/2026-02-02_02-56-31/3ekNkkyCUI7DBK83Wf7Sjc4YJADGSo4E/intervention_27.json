Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to the brother, but the user wasn't around for that. The brother refuses to help, and the user told him he needs to for their mom's sake. The brother got angry and said he won't help.\n\nSo, the main points here. The brother has valid reasons for not wanting to be involved because of the abuse. The user is trying to mediate between their mom's needs and their brother's feelings. Did the user have the right to tell their brother he's obligated? Well, maybe they did, but maybe they didn't consider the brother's trauma enough. The user might have thought they were helping their mom, but the brother's refusal is about his own experience. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? They might not be entirely, because they were trying to support their mom, but they should have considered their brother's feelings more. However, telling someone they \"have an obligation\" might not be the best approach when there's trauma involved. Maybe the user should have encouraged without making it sound like a duty. But the brother's reaction was harsh. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong for trying to help their mom, but maybe could have handled it better. Still, the answer is probably B (No) because they were trying to do the right thing from their perspective, even if the execution could be better. The brother's choice not to help is his right, but the user isn't wrong for asking him to consider it for their mom.\n"
