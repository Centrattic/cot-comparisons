Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their dad's funeral and whether the older brother, Jeff, should help. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help their mom, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, especially when drunk. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in touch since. The author wasn't around during the worst of the abuse because they were born later. The dad mellowed out after the author was born, maybe due to sobriety. Now the mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nThe author's intention was to support their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff's reaction was strong\u2014he called the author an idiot, mentioned the past abuse, and refused to help. The author is caught between their mom's feelings and Jeff's justified anger.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to mediate a situation where Jeff has a valid reason to be upset. The author might not have considered Jeff's trauma when suggesting he has an obligation. But the author also wanted to help their mom, who is grieving. The key point is whether the author had the right to impose on Jeff's decision not to participate. Since Jeff has a history of abuse, his choice not to help might be a personal one based on his experiences. The author's approach might have been insensitive, assuming Jeff should help despite the past. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. Alternatively, the author was trying to help their mom, which is understandable. \n\nBut considering Jeff's history, the author's message might have been dismissive of his feelings. The question is about obligation. The author told Jeff he has an obligation, but if Jeff's trauma makes it impossible, that obligation might not be fair. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's decision, even if they meant well. On the other hand, the author was trying to support their mom. It's a tough call. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help their mom, but maybe A (in the wrong) for not respecting Jeff's feelings. Hmm. I think the answer is B, but I'm a bit conflicted. The key is Jeff's justified reasons and the author's intentions.\n"
