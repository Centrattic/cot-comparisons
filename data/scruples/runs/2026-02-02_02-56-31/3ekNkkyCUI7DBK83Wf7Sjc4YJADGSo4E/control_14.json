Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. The situation involves family dynamics, past abuse, and current tensions.\n\nFirst, the author's dad was abusive to their brother Jeff, especially when drinking. He mellowed out after the author was born, maybe due to sobriety. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now, the dad died, and Jeff refuses to help with the funeral, which is upsetting their mom. The author tried to convince Jeff, leading to an argument where Jeff called the author an idiot and refused to help.\n\nThe key points here are: Jeff's past trauma from the abuse, the author's intention to help their mom, and Jeff's right to set boundaries. The author might feel they're helping Mom by getting Jeff involved, but Jeff might not want to participate because of the abuse. \n\nI need to consider ethical aspects. Is the author wrong to pressure Jeff? Well, Jeff might feel no obligation to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive. The author might not realize that forcing Jeff could add trauma. On the other hand, the author is trying to support their mom, which is understandable. However, respecting Jeff's boundaries is important too. \n\nThe author's approach was confrontational, telling Jeff what he \"needs\" to do, which might not be the best way to handle a sensitive issue. The author could have approached it more empathetically, maybe finding a middle ground. So, while the author's intention is to help their mom, the method might be wrong. Hence, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the author was just advocating for their mom's feelings, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the key is that Jeff has valid reasons to not want to participate. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries.\n"
