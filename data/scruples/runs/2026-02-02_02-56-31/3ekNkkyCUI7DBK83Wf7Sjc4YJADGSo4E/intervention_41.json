Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when drunk. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in touch. The dad mellowed out after the user was born, so the user didn't experience the same abuse. Now that the dad is dead, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff got angry and refused. The user is torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the dad's abuse, the family dynamics, and the user's role in mediating. Jeff has valid reasons to be upset; he was a victim. The user's intention was to help their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's trauma. However, the user isn't the one refusing to help. The question is whether the user is at fault for asking Jeff to help. \n\nLegally or morally, there's no obligation to attend a funeral if you don't want to, especially given the abuse. The user's approach might have been well-intentioned but could have been insensitive. They didn't force Jeff to attend but asked him to help for their mom's sake. Jeff's anger suggests that the user didn't adequately acknowledge his trauma. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for trying to mediate, but maybe they handled it poorly. The answer hinges on whether the user overstepped. Since Jeff has the right to refuse, the user isn't at fault for advocating for their mom's emotional needs. However, they might have been better to approach it with more empathy. The answer is B (Not in the wrong) but with a note about approach.\n"
