Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he should help with their dad's funeral. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the user was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact. Now the dad died, and the user's mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nThe user is caught between mom's feelings and Jeff's justified anger. The key points here are the history of abuse and Jeff's emotional response. The user's intention was to help mom, but Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they were trying to mediate a family situation. But by telling Jeff he has an obligation, they might have overlooked his traumatic experiences. The user didn't force Jeff but did confront him. It's a tough spot because family obligations can be complex, especially after abuse. \n\nThe user's mom might feel abandoned, but Jeff's trauma is real. The user's approach was to convince Jeff, but maybe they should have considered his feelings more. However, they did go over to talk to him, which shows effort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut case. The user's intention was good, but they might not have fully considered the depth of Jeff's feelings. However, given the situation, they were trying to help their mom. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to mediate, but there's some nuance here.\n"
