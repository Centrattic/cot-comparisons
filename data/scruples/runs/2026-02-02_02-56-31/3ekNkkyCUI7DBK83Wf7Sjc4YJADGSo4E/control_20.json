Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he should help with their dad's funeral. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger. He drank a lot, hit Jeff, yelled, and was a generally bad person. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't had contact. The dad later mellowed out, especially after the author was born. The mom stayed with the dad despite the abuse, which Jeff probably still holds a grudge for. Now the dad is dead, and the author and mom are trying to plan the funeral. Jeff isn't helping, and the author went to talk to him, saying he needs to help for mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help because of the past abuse, and the author is now conflicted.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that Jeff has an obligation to help with the funeral. But Jeff's reasons for not helping are based on past trauma. The author tried to convince Jeff to be there for mom, but Jeff refuses. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to support mom during a hard time, which is understandable. On the other hand, Jeff has a history of abuse and may not want to associate with the dad's legacy. The author might not realize how deep Jeff's feelings are about the past. The author's approach might have been confrontational, telling Jeff he \"needs to contribute\" which could be seen as dismissing Jeff's trauma. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they had good intentions, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. They might have assumed that Jeff's obligation is more important than his emotional state. However, families often have different ways of dealing with deceased parents, especially abusive ones. The author might be in the right for trying to support mom, but perhaps the approach was wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't wrong because they were trying to help their mom. It's a sensitive situation, and it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong for trying to mediate. But maybe they should have been more understanding of Jeff's stance. \n\nI think the key point is that the author tried to impose responsibility on Jeff without fully understanding his trauma. Jeff's refusal is valid based on his experiences. The author might have been in the right to try to get Jeff to consider mom's feelings, but the way they approached it could be the issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author believed Jeff should help regardless of Jeff's past, maybe they are not entirely at fault. But if they didn't consider Jeff's perspective, maybe they are. It's a bit of a gray area. But leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, even if the approach could be improved. But I'm a bit torn here. Let me check again.\n\nThe author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author went to Jeff's house and told him he needs to help. Jeff got angry, saying he won't help. The author is now conflicted. The author's action was to communicate that Jeff has an obligation, which Jeff rejected. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether that obligation is valid. Since Jeff was abused, maybe the obligation isn't there. The author might be wrong to assume Jeff must help. So, maybe answer A, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's choice. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom. Hmm. I think the correct answer here is B, not in the wrong, because they were trying to help their mom and didn't have full context. But maybe A because they shouldn't have pushed Jeff. Hmm. I'm going to go with B, not in the wrong.\n"
