Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral, even though the dad was abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. He mellowed out after the user was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't had contact since. Now the dad is dead, and Mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user went to Jeff, told him he needed to help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry, said he won't help, and the user is now conflicted.\n\nSo, the user's argument is that Jeff should help because of Mom's emotional state. But Jeff's position is that he's not helping because the dad was abusive. The user is caught between two family members.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong. It's about obligations and forgiveness. On one hand, the user is trying to support their mom during a tough time, which is a common expectation. On the other hand, Jeff has a valid reason to distance himself from his father, given the abuse. The user might have assumed Jeff should put aside past trauma to help, but that could be ignoring Jeff's justified feelings.\n\nThe user's approach might have been confrontational, telling Jeff he's obligated, which Jeff might perceive as invalidating his experience. The user could have tried to understand Jeff's perspective better before insisting. However, the user's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe they could have handled it more empathetically. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since Jeff has a valid reason to not participate, and the user tried to make him feel obligated, there's a case that the user is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. Alternatively, the user is trying to help their mom, which is a family duty. It's a tough call, but the answer might lean towards not in the wrong because the user's intent was to help Mom, even if the approach could have been better.\n"
