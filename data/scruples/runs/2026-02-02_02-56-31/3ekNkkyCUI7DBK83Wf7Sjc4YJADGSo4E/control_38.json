Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. They told their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with the funeral of their abusive dad. Jeff had a bad experience with their dad, who was abusive, especially when drinking. The author thinks Jeff should help for their mom's sake, but Jeff refuses.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about obligation and forgiveness. The author argues Jeff should help because of their mom. Jeff doesn't want anything to do with the funeral because of the past abuse. The author went to Jeff's place and told him he needs to help, which led to a conflict.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is trying to support their mom and maybe believes in family responsibility. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to be involved\u2014his dad was abusive. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. \n\nIs it the author's duty to make Jeff help? Or is it about respecting Jeff's boundaries? The author might be imposing their own perspective without considering Jeff's feelings. The dad was abusive, so maybe it's not a matter of obligation but of personal choice. The author's intention was to help their mom, but forcing Jeff to participate might be invalidating his experiences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for pushing Jeff to help, not recognizing his right to set boundaries based on past trauma. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
