Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, and Jeff left home early. Now the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the user tried to convince Jeff, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive, which is a serious issue. The brother Jeff has a valid reason to be upset and not want to participate, given the abuse. The user is trying to mediate for their mom's sake, but that could be seen as pressuring Jeff to reconcile with someone he had a traumatic relationship with.\n\nThe user's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. However, pressuring a sibling to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive might not be fair to Jeff. The user might not realize the emotional toll this could have on Jeff. Also, the user's approach led to Jeff feeling attacked, which caused him to lash out.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is grieving and might need support from both children. The user is caught in the middle, trying to balance both their needs. But the key point is whether the user overstepped by telling Jeff he \"has an obligation.\" Obligations can be cultural or family expectations, but in cases of abuse, the emotional readiness is important. The user might not have considered Jeff's boundaries and trauma, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They acted with good intentions but didn't consider Jeff's perspective and emotional state. Pressuring someone to participate in a funeral for an abuser can be harmful. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the user is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and didn't fully understand the emotional context.\n"
