Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, especially when drinking. After the author was born, the father mellowed out. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact since. The father died, and the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff to help, but Jeff reacted negatively, refusing to participate.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the obligation, the history of abuse, and the author's role in pushing Jeff. The author's intention was to help their mom, but Jeff's refusal is understandable given the past abuse. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff. They might not have considered that Jeff has a valid reason to be upset and not want to participate. The author's approach might come off as imposing an obligation that Jeff doesn't feel he has, especially given the abusive history. \n\nObligations can be tricky. While family members might feel a cultural or familial duty, if the person had a deeply negative experience with the deceased, that obligation isn't straightforward. The author might have assumed Jeff still has a duty, but Jeff's trauma and resentment could override that. \n\nThe author's mistake was possibly not respecting Jeff's boundaries and emotional state. They might have thought they were helping their mom, but they didn't account for Jeff's justified feelings. The author's message might have sounded like they were making Jeff choose between his mother and the past, which is a harsh position.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it differently. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer leans towards B (No), because the author's intentions were to help their mom, and Jeff's refusal is rooted in valid reasons. The author isn't wrong for trying to mediate, even if the outcome wasn't successful.\n"
