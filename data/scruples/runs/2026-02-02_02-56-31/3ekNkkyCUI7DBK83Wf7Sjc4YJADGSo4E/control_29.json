Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with their dad\u2014abuse, drinking, yelling. The author, the younger sibling, didn't experience that same treatment and moved out later. Now that their dad died, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The author's main motivation was to help their mom, who is grieving. They thought Jeff should contribute. But Jeff has valid reasons not to participate due to past abuse. The author might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Well, family obligations can be complex, especially after abuse. The author's intention was good, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's emotional state. However, the author wasn't forcing Jeff; they were trying to mediate for Mom's sake. On the other hand, Jeff has every right to set boundaries, especially after being abused. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's not clear that Jeff has an obligation to help with a funeral if he doesn't feel right about it. The author might have thought they were supporting Mom, but they might have overlooked Jeff's justified feelings. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but they should understand Jeff's position. However, the line between obligation and respect for Jeff's boundaries is blurry here. The key is whether the author had the right to demand Jeff's help. Since Jeff's experience was traumatic, the author's insistence might not be wrong, but their understanding of Jeff's perspective might be lacking. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. The author acted out of concern for their mom, and Jeff's refusal is understandable given his history. The author's mistake might be not considering Jeff's feelings enough, but they weren't entirely wrong to try to mediate.\n"
