Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, the situation: The dad was abusive to Jeff, the older brother, especially when he was drinking. After the younger sibling was born, the dad mellowed out. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in touch. Now, the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help for Mom's sake. Jeff was angry, called the author an idiot, and refused to help.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he should help. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that Jeff should help for Mom's sake. But Jeff has a history of being abused by their dad. The author was not subjected to the same abuse, so maybe they don't fully understand Jeff's feelings. However, the author was trying to mediate between the mom and Jeff. \n\nIs it wrong to ask someone to participate in a funeral for a parent they had a bad relationship with? Well, there's a difference between cultural obligations and personal boundaries. In some cultures, family obligations are important, but in others, people might choose not to participate in a funeral if they have unresolved trauma. \n\nThe author's intention was to help the mom, which is understandable. But Jeff's refusal could be due to his own trauma. The author might not have considered that Jeff could be in a place where he can't emotionally handle the funeral. \n\nHowever, the author did approach Jeff calmly, explained Mom's feelings, and tried to reason with him. Jeff's response was hostile, which complicates things. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to mediate. \n\nBut maybe the author overstepped by implying Jeff had an obligation. Jeff might feel that the family didn't support him during the abuse, so why should he help now? The author might not have considered that angle. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's mom is hurt and needs support. The author wanted to help her by involving Jeff. It's a tough spot. \n\nIn conclusion, while Jeff's reaction was harsh, the author's actions were based on concern for the mom. The author isn't wrong for trying to reach out, even if Jeff didn't take it well. The key is that the author's intent was to help, and Jeff's refusal is his choice. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
