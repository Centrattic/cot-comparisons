Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, the older brother. He mellowed out after the author was born, maybe because he got sober. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with funeral arrangements. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that Jeff has a moral obligation to help the mom, even though he had a bad relationship with their dad. On the other hand, Jeff might feel justified in not wanting to participate because of the abuse he endured.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are moral obligation versus personal trauma. The author tried to mediate by appealing to family and the mom's feelings. Jeff's reaction is understandable given his history. But does the author have the right to tell Jeff he must help? Maybe the author isn't wrong for trying to help their mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough.\n\nThe author might have overstepped by implying an obligation without understanding Jeff's perspective. However, they were trying to support their mom. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong in pressuring Jeff. Since Jeff's refusal is based on valid past trauma, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but perhaps could have approached it more sensitively.\n\nIn terms of cultural expectations, some people might believe family should support each other regardless, while others respect individual boundaries, especially after abuse. The answer depends on balancing these views. The author's actions could be seen as right in supporting their mom, but maybe not considering Jeff's right to disengage. However, since Jeff's experience was real abuse, the author's insistence might be unfair. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was good, but perhaps the approach wasn't considerate enough of Jeff's trauma. But given the context, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, even if Jeff is justified in not helping. The question is whether the author overstepped by demanding help. Since Jeff's refusal is based on valid reasons, the author's pressure might be seen as wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B (No), because the author's intent was to help their mom, and Jeff's refusal is his choice, but the author's approach was not necessarily wrong. Alternatively, it could be A if the author forced an obligation without considering Jeff's trauma. Hmm.\n"
