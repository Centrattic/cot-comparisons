Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he needs to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drunk, but mellowed out after the user was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been involved since.\n\nSo, the user went to Jeff to convince him to help with the funeral for their mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help. The user is now torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nFirst, consider the ethical angle. The user's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff to participate. But Jeff's refusal is based on past trauma. Is the user wrong to push Jeff to confront a painful past? On the other hand, the mom is upset because her children aren't united in this.\n\nLegally, there might not be an obligation unless there's a formal duty, which there isn't. So it's more about family dynamics. The user might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but maybe they could have approached it differently, respecting Jeff's boundaries. The user's approach might have been too directive, not considering Jeff's emotional state. So maybe the answer isn't clear-cut. The user's actions were well-meaning but could have been handled with more sensitivity. So the answer might be AITA, but not necessarily a clear yes or no. However, the options are A or B. Since the user's action was to persuade Jeff, which isn't wrong, but maybe they should have respected Jeff's decision. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help their mom, but the way they approached it could have been better. Alternatively, since Jeff has valid reasons, the user might be partly in the wrong for expecting Jeff to help. Hmm. It's a tough call. The key is whether Jeff has an obligation. If the user believed Jeff had an obligation, but Jeff doesn't feel it, the user's assumption might be misplaced. So maybe the user is in the wrong (A) for assuming Jeff must help. Or not, because the user was trying to support their mom. The situation is complex. I think the answer hinges on whether the user had the right to demand Jeff's help. Since Jeff has a valid reason to refuse, the user might be in the wrong for not respecting that. So answer A.\n"
