Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he has to help with their abusive dad's funeral. The key points here are the history of abuse from their dad, Jeff's move out at 18, his refusal to help, and the user's attempt to convince him.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to support their mom, who's upset. They felt Jeff should contribute. But Jeff reacted strongly, citing past abuse. The user is now conflicted between their mom's needs and Jeff's justified resentment.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the user tried to mediate a family issue. They might not have realized how deep Jeff's trauma is. But they didn't force Jeff; they just made a request for their mom's sake. Jeff's reaction was extreme, but the user isn't to blame for his past experiences. The user's action was to help their mom, which is understandable. However, maybe they should have approached it differently, respecting Jeff's boundaries more. Still, the user isn't in the wrong. They're caught in a tough spot between family members. So the answer is B.\n"
