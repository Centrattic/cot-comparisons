Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. The situation is about their brother not helping with their dad's funeral, and the user told their brother he has an obligation to help for their mom's sake. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was younger. He drank a lot and was mean. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't come back. The dad mellowed out after the user was born, so the user didn't experience the same abuse. Now that the dad died, the mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nThe user went to Jeff's place to convince him, saying he needs to help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry, called the user an idiot, and refused to help. The user is now wondering if they were wrong to push Jeff.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse, the user's lack of direct experience with it, and the request to help despite that history. The user's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. But Jeff's refusal is rooted in his traumatic experiences. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, does the user have the right to tell Jeff he must help? Families often have complex emotions, especially after abuse. Pressuring someone who has been a victim of abuse to participate in a funeral might be insensitive, even if the motive is to help the mother. However, the user's concern for their mom's feelings is valid. \n\nBut the user might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma, given that they weren't subjected to the same treatment. Maybe the user's approach was well-intentioned but didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. Telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" could sound like ignoring his past. However, the user might not be entirely wrong because they're trying to mediate between mom and brother. \n\nOn the other hand, the user could have approached it more empathetically, perhaps suggesting compromise rather than obligation. But since Jeff was already against helping, confrontation might not be the best approach. The user's action might not be malicious, but the method could be questioned. \n\nIn summary, while the user's intent was to help their mom, they might not have considered the depth of Jeff's trauma, leading to a conflict. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because they pressured Jeff without fully understanding his reasons, but there's also a case for B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to support their mother. The balance here is tricky. However, given the context of abuse and the brother's refusal, the user's approach might be seen as insensitive, hence A.\n"
