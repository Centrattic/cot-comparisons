Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive father's funeral. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when drinking. He mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18, and hasn't had contact since. Now that the dad is dead, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff refused, angry about past abuse. The author is conflicted between supporting Mom and understanding Jeff's position.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting Jeff to help. Let's consider the ethics here. On one hand, the author might feel that as family, Jeff should help for Mom's sake. But on the other hand, Jeff has a history of abuse from their father. Expecting someone to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to them could be hurtful and unrealistic. The author might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma or the fact that the father's behavior was unacceptable. \n\nThe author's reasoning for Jeff's obligation could stem from a sense of family duty, but it's possible they're not acknowledging the severity of the abuse Jeff endured. The father's actions were harmful, and holding Jeff responsible to help could be seen as invalidating his experiences and emotions. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that Jeff's refusal is a valid response to his trauma. However, the author's intention was to support Mom, which is understandable. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the author had the right to pressure Jeff. Since the father was abusive, Jeff's decision not to participate is a personal choice that should be respected. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but the expectation that Jeff has an obligation to help, given the abuse, is where the problem lies. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but considering the ethical angle, it's more about whether the obligation exists despite the abuse. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) because they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. Hmm.\n\nI think the key here is that the author might not fully appreciate the trauma Jeff went through. The father's behavior was abhorrent, and expecting Jeff to help in the funeral could be adding insult to injury. The author's approach might be well-meaning but misguided. So the author is not in the wrong entirely because they're trying to help their mom, but they might be overlooking Jeff's justified feelings. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that request. Since Jeff's refusal is a reasonable response to his history, the author's expectation might be the wrong part. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the author's intention was to help their mom, but the situation's complexity makes it not entirely their fault. Alternatively, maybe A if the author should have considered Jeff's perspective more. But given the information, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they're caught between two family members and their intention was to help Mom.\n"
