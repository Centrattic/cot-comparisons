Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, the older brother. The user's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user went to Jeff and told him he needs to help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jeff had a really bad experience with their dad. He moved out as soon as he could and hasn't looked back. The dad became sober after the user was born, which might explain why the user didn't experience the same abuse. Now, the dad's died, and the user feels Jeff should help with the funeral, even though Jeff might not want to.\n\nThe mother is hurting both from her husband's death and her son's absence. The user is caught in between, trying to mediate. The user's message was to convince Jeff to help, but Jeff reacted negatively, feeling that the user doesn't understand his pain. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they were trying to help Mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has valid reasons not to want to participate. The user didn't force him, but they might have assumed he should help regardless of his past trauma. Maybe the user should have considered Jeff's feelings more before approaching him. However, they were acting out of concern for Mom's emotional state. It's a tough situation where both sides have valid points. \n\nThe user might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but perhaps they could have approached Jeff more sensitively. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The key is whether they have an obligation to make Jeff help. Since Jeff has a history of abuse, it's understandable he doesn't want to participate. The user might have overstepped by implying Jeff has an obligation, not considering his right to disengage. So maybe the user is partially at fault for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. But they were trying to help. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer hinges on whether the user respected Jeff's autonomy versus trying to push for Mom's sake. Since Jeff's trauma is real, the user might have been wrong to pressure him without understanding his stance better. So answer A, they are in the wrong.\n"
