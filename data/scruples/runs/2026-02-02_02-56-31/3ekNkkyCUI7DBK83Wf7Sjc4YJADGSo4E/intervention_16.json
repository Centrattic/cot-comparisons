Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their father's funeral and whether the older brother, Jeff, should help. The user went to Jeff's house to convince him to help their mom because she's upset. Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the siblings and their parents. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the user was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact much. Now, the dad is dead, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The user tried to mediate but Jeff reacted negatively.\n\nThe user's argument is that Jeff has an obligation to help with the funeral for Mom's sake. Jeff's side is that he doesn't want to be involved because of past abuse. The user's mom is caught in the middle, dealing with grief and family tension.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, the user's intention was to help their mom by encouraging Jeff to participate. But they might not have considered Jeff's trauma. The user's approach was confrontational, calling Jeff out for being a \"dick,\" which could have been seen as dismissive of Jeff's feelings. However, the user also acknowledges their brother's pain and the father's abuse, which shows some empathy.\n\nLegally or in terms of family obligations, there might not be a strict requirement for Jeff to participate. Emotionally, it's complex. The user tried to mediate but may not have handled it the best way. However, the user's main goal was to support their mom, which is understandable. Jeff's refusal is also valid given his history. The user isn't necessarily wrong for trying to bridge the gap, but maybe the method was harsh. However, since the options are only A or B, and the user's intent was good, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
