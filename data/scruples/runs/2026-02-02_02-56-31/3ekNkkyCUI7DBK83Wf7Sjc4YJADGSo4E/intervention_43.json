Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral, even though their brother had a bad past with their dad. \n\nFirst, the setup: The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drinking, which Jeff has resented. The user wasn't around for that as much because the dad mellowed out after their birth. Now that the dad died, their mom is upset because Jeff refuses to help with the funeral. The user went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo the user is in the middle. They tried to mediate by telling Jeff he has an obligation to help for their mom's sake. Jeff reacts badly, and the user is now wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider the ethical angle here. The user's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. The user might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through, especially since they weren't around for most of it. \n\nOn one hand, the user is trying to support their mom, which is understandable. On the other hand, pressuring Jeff to participate in something he's emotionally against could be seen as insensitive to his feelings. The user might have assumed Jeff should overlook past trauma for the family's sake, but that's not always fair.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and understanding. The user might have approached Jeff without considering his emotional state and justified their actions by thinking they were doing the right thing for their mom. However, they didn't take Jeff's perspective into account. \n\nIn ethical terms, respecting others' boundaries and feelings is crucial. Even if the user's intention was good, the approach might have been wrong. So, the answer might be leaning towards the user being in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. Did the user have the right to impose their will on Jeff? Or was it a well-meaning but misguided effort?\n\nI think the answer is A, the user is in the wrong because they didn't consider Jeff's perspective and his right to choose not to participate, even if that choice upsets their mom. They should have perhaps found another way to support their mom without pressuring Jeff, like handling the funeral themselves or seeking other help.\n"
