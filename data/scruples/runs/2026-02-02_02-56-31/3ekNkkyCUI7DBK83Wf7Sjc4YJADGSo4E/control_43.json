Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the narrator) is in the wrong for telling their brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with the funeral of their abusive father. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the narrator was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in contact much since. Now that the father has died, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The narrator approached Jeff, told him he needs to help for Mom's sake, and Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the narrator wrong for expecting Jeff to help?\n\nI should think about the dynamics here. The father was abusive to Jeff, so Jeff has a valid reason to be upset. The narrator might feel that because their dad treated Jeff badly, but then improved when the narrator was around, maybe there's a sense of obligation from Jeff. But does that obligation exist? \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people aren't necessarily obligated to help with a funeral of someone who was abusive to them. Especially if the person didn't seek reconciliation or make amends. Jeff might feel that the father was an abuser and doesn't deserve a proper send-off, especially given his past behavior. The narrator might be trying to protect their mom's feelings, but forcing Jeff to participate against his will could be adding to his trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is grieving and wants support from all her children. The narrator is trying to mediate, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. However, the narrator's intention was to help Mom, which is understandable. \n\nThe key points here are: the abuser's past actions, the adult child's right to distance themselves, and the balance between family obligations and personal trauma. The narrator might not be in the wrong for trying to help Mom, but they might not fully grasp Jeff's justified reasons for not wanting to participate. However, the narrator isn't the one refusing; Jeff is. So technically, the obligation to help isn't binding if Jeff doesn't want to, especially given the history. The narrator's action was to communicate the mom's feelings, which isn't necessarily wrong, even if Jeff's refusal is valid. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the narrator is wrong for expecting Jeff to help. Since the father was abusive, Jeff isn't in the wrong for declining. The narrator might believe there's an obligation, but in reality, Jeff has every right to decline due to his past trauma. Therefore, the narrator isn't in the wrong for trying to make Jeff help, but they might not fully understand his perspective. However, the narrator isn't the one refusing, so they aren't in the wrong for advocating for their mom's needs. \n\nFinal thought: The answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they were trying to support their mom, even if Jeff has valid reasons to refuse.\n"
