Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their brother he has to help with their abusive dad's funeral. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive when the older brother, Jeff, was younger. He'd drink a lot, hit Jeff, yell at the mom and Jeff. But after the author was born, the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. The author wasn't subjected to the same abuse as Jeff and left home when he was 18. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to tell him he needs to help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for pushing Jeff to help. From what I read, the key points are the history of abuse, Jeff's justified anger, and the author's attempt to reconcile Mom's feelings with Jeff's trauma. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Well, maybe they didn't consider how their words might land. The author might have assumed Jeff should help because of family obligations, but Jeff's trauma is real. However, the author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. \n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? If Jeff's refusal stems from valid reasons (abuse), then maybe the author should have understood. However, the author was trying to mediate between Mom and Jeff, which is a common family role. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to help their mom and didn't know that Jeff had such strong negative feelings. But then again, they might have overstepped by telling Jeff he has an obligation. But the mom asked the author to talk to Jeff, so the author was following her request. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have respected Jeff's boundaries, but they didn't know the extent of Jeff's trauma. It's a tough call. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they were acting from a place of trying to help their mom, even if they didn't realize Jeff's feelings. So answer B.\n"
