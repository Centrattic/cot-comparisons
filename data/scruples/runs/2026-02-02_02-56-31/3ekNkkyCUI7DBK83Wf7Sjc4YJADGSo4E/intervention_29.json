Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he should help with their dad's funeral despite Jeff's past abuse.\n\nFirst, the situation: their dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drunk. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved since. After the dad's death, the mother is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user tried to convince Jeff, arguing that he should help for their mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to participate.\n\nNow, the user is caught between their mom's feelings and Jeff's justified anger. The core issue is whether the user was wrong to pressure Jeff into helping, given his history with their dad.\n\nOn one hand, the user might feel they were trying to support their mom, who's grieving and upset. They might think Jeff should put aside past issues for family duty. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate, given the abuse he endured. The user might have overlooked Jeff's trauma and his right to choose not to engage with his abusive father's funeral.\n\nThe key points are empathy for Jeff's past and the mother's emotional state. The user's intention was to help their mom, but they didn't consider Jeff's feelings as much. By telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" despite the abuse, the user might have dismissed Jeff's justified resentment. Obligations can be subjective, especially in the context of trauma. The user's approach could have been more understanding and supportive of Jeff's decision, rather than insisting he should help.\n\nSo, while the user's intention was good, the method might have been flawed. They might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but they could have approached the situation with more sensitivity to Jeff's experiences. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the user was trying to mediate a family issue, but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
