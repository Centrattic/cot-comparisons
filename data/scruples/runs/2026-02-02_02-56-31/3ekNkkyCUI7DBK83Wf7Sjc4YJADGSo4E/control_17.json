Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: Their dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drunk, and became less so after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18, and hasn't been in touch. Now that their dad died, their mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to ask him to help, but Jeff was angry and refused.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the father's abuse, Jeff's experience, and whether there's an obligation to help with the funeral. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to reconcile their mom's feelings with Jeff's justified anger. The author's intention was to help their mom, so maybe that's a good motive. But Jeff's refusal is understandable given his traumatic history. The author told Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which might be the issue. Obligations can be subjective, especially in family matters involving past trauma. \n\nThe author might be in the right for trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff, but the way they framed it (obligation) could be seen as pressuring Jeff to engage with someone he has a legitimate reason to cut off. The question is whether the author overstepped by imposing a duty on Jeff.\n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't forcing Jeff to attend the funeral but to help with planning. However, given Jeff's history, maybe that's too much to ask. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's emotional state enough. \n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the obligation is fair. Since Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to be involved, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to help mom, but their approach could be questioned. However, the question is strictly whether they are in the wrong, not how they could have done better. \n\nIn some cases, family obligations are expected, but when there's abuse involved, it's more complex. The author's perspective is that Jeff should help for mom's sake, but Jeff's refusal is a personal choice. The author isn't necessarily wrong for advocating for their mom's emotional needs, even if Jeff's stance is justified. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because the author is trying to help their mom, even if their brother has reasons not to participate. The obligation isn't clear-cut, and the author isn't forcing Jeff to attend, just to contribute. The wrong here would depend on if the author had the right to demand it. Given the circumstances, the author's action isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
