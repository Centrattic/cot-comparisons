Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves family dynamics, abuse history, and a funeral obligation.\n\nFirst, the author's brother, Jeff, had a terrible time with their dad who was abusive. The dad stopped drinking after the author was born and mellowed out, so the author didn't experience the same abuse. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't helped with the funeral planning. The author tried to convince Jeff to help, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is now questioning if they were wrong to tell Jeff he should help.\n\nSo, the key points are: Jeff's right to disengage from the funeral due to past trauma, the mother's emotional state, and the author's role in mediating. \n\nThe author's intention was to support their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has valid reasons to be upset and not want to participate. The author might have assumed Jeff should feel obligated, not considering Jeff's feelings. However, the author might also be trying to protect their mom's feelings, which is understandable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't force Jeff, just tried to persuade him. Jeff's refusal is his right, so the author's attempt might not be wrong, but maybe they should have been more sensitive. But since the author is caught between two family members, it's a tough spot. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but maybe a nuanced view. However, the question is strictly A or B. Given the circumstances, the author's action isn't malicious, so B makes sense.\n"
