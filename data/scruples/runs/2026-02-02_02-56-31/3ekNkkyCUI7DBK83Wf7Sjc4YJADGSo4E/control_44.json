Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the older brother (Jeff) should be expected to help with their father's funeral, even though the father was abusive.\n\nFirst, the author's dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now the dad died, and the author and mom want Jeff to participate in the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff, urging him to help for Mom's sake. Jeff reacts angrily, saying he won't help because of the abuse. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to push Jeff.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, the author is trying to support their mom by getting Jeff involved. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author might believe that family obligations extend to funeral arrangements, regardless of past issues. The author's intention was to help Mom, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeff had a very traumatic experience with their father. The father was abusive, and Jeff has chosen to distance himself from the family because of that. Forcing him to participate in a funeral might be retraumatizing. The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's trauma, especially since the father was less abusive when the author was born. The author asked Jeff to help, which could be seen as invalidating Jeff's feelings and experiences.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by expecting Jeff to help. The author's argument is that Jeff has an obligation, but family obligations can be subjective, especially in cases of abuse. Jeff's refusal could be a valid decision based on his past. The author might not have considered that Jeff's mental health and well-being are important, and pushing for his involvement could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's approach might have been confrontational. Jeff's anger suggests that the author triggered bad memories. The author might not have approached the situation with enough empathy, not realizing that Jeff's trauma is a legitimate reason to opt out of the funeral. The author's intention was to help the mom, but in doing so, might have overlooked Jeff's needs and boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom. However, they might not have considered Jeff's perspective and trauma enough. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because their intention was good, but they might have handled it poorly. However, depending on the context, pushing someone to participate in a funeral after abuse could be seen as wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key is whether the author had the right to pressure Jeff. Since Jeff's trauma is valid, the author might have been wrong to insist. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, which is a judgment call. Given the circumstances, I think the answer is B, but some might say A. However, since the author's action was based on their mother's feelings and not considering Jeff's trauma, maybe A. Wait, but the author did mention understanding why Jeff doesn't want to help, so perhaps they're not entirely wrong. Hmmm. Maybe B. The author's intention was to help the mother, and while they might not have handled it perfectly, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The final answer is B.\n"
