Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: Their dad was abusive towards the brother, Jeff, especially when he was younger. The author wasn't around when the worst happened because they were born later. The brother left home at 18 and hasn't been in touch since. Now, the dad died, and the mother is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff, telling him he should help for mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to participate.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff. The key points here are the history of abuse, Jeff's valid reasons for not wanting to help, and the mother's emotional state. The author's intention was to support mom, but Jeff's trauma is real. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation for family members to participate in funerals unless there's a legal binding, which there isn't here. Emotionally, it's complicated. The author might feel caught between siblings, but did they overstep by imposing their will? The author's argument is that Jeff should help for mom's sake, but Jeff's refusal is due to his past trauma. The author might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's feelings. \n\nIs the author wrong? They tried to mediate, but forced involvement could be harmful. The answer might hinge on whether the author respected Jeff's autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help, but perhaps could have handled it differently, considering Jeff's perspective more. However, given the situation, the author's action was\u51fa\u4e8e\u597d\u610f, so possibly not in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the author might not realize that Jeff has a right to refuse. The obligation isn't absolute. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for assuming obligation where there isn't one. The answer might be A. But I need to check again. \n\nThe user wants a simple A or B. The key is whether the author was wrong. Since Jeff's reasons are valid and the author pushed him, maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the author's intent was to help mom and they didn't know Jeff's feelings, it's complicated. However, the author should have considered Jeff's past before demanding help. So, the answer might be A. But others might say the author was trying to help. Hmm. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for expecting Jeff to participate against his will, given the abuse history.\n"
