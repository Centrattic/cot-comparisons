Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the situation: The dad was abusive to Jeff, the older brother, especially when he was drinking. After the author was born, the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18, and the author stayed with the parents. Now the dad is dead, and the author and mom are handling the funeral. Jeff is refusing to help, which is hurting the mom. The author tried to convince Jeff, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the author's main point is whether they were wrong to ask Jeff to help. The question is about obligation. The author's mom is upset, but Jeff has valid reasons not to participate due to past abuse. \n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation.\" The obligation part is key. Family obligations can be subjective. Jeff might feel no obligation because of the abuse. The author might be projecting their own relationship with the dad (which improved) onto Jeff. \n\nThe author's intention was to help the mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough. Telling someone they have an obligation could be seen as pressuring them, especially if their reasons for not participating are valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's mom is struggling, and the author is trying to mediate. However, whether they were wrong depends on whether they overstepped. The author's advice might be well-intentioned, but if Jeff's reasons are legitimate, the author might not be in the right to insist on that obligation. \n\nAlso, the author didn't inform the mom about Jeff's outburst, which might be part of the situation. But the main point is the obligation. \n\nI think the author's position assumes that Jeff has a duty to help despite his past, but given the abuse, Jeff might have a right to refuse. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. Therefore, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
