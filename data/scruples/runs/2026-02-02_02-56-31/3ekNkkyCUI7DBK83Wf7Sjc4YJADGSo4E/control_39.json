Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive when the brother, Jeff, was younger, but became mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home when he was 18 and hasn't been in touch. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff was angry and refused. The author is now caught between mom's feelings and Jeff's justified anger.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong to push Jeff. Well, the author's intention was to help mom, which is understandable. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate in the funeral of someone who abused him. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a way of dealing with his past trauma. By pressuring Jeff, the author might have dismissed his feelings. However, the author also might not have realized the extent of the abuse or Jeff's pain. \n\nOn one hand, respecting Jeff's choice is important. On the other hand, the author is trying to support mom. But the author's approach might have been confrontational, telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which could sound dismissive of his experience. Obligations in such emotional situations aren't straightforward, especially when the deceased was abusive. The author might not have been in the wrong for wanting to help mom, but perhaps the way they approached Jeff was inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering the options, the author's actions could be seen as well-intentioned but misguided. They might not be in the wrong entirely, but their approach could have been more empathetic. The key is whether the author understood Jeff's perspective. Since the author acknowledges understanding Jeff's reasons but still tried to push him, maybe there's a balance here. The answer might lean towards not in the wrong (B) because the intent was to help mom, but the execution was flawed. However, depending on cultural or familial expectations, the obligation might be seen as valid. But given the abuse context, Jeff's refusal is understandable. So the author isn't in the wrong, but their approach could be questioned. The final answer is B.\n"
