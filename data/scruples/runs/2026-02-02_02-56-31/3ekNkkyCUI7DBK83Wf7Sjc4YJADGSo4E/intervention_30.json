Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their dad's funeral and whether the older brother, Jeff, should help. The user went to Jeff and told him he has an obligation to help with the funeral for their mom's sake. Now Jeff is upset and won't help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, which is a big deal. The user's mom stayed with him despite the abuse, which Jeff might still hold against her. The user is trying to mediate because mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping. \n\nThe user's main point is that they told Jeff he has an obligation to help. Is that the right approach? Well, considering Jeff's past with the dad, maybe the user didn't consider how hurtful it might be to bring up obligations. Jeff might feel that the dad didn't deserve any help, especially after the abuse. The user might have been trying to help their mom but didn't take into account Jeff's feelings and justified anger.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is grieving and might need support from both children. The user is caught in the middle. But the key question is whether the user was wrong in demanding Jeff to help. The user might not have realized that Jeff's refusal is a valid emotional response to past trauma. Instead of emphasizing obligation, maybe the user should have tried to understand Jeff's perspective better or found a different way to support mom without pressuring Jeff.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the user was wrong to tell Jeff he had an obligation because they didn't acknowledge his valid reasons for not wanting to participate. The answer could be A, but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing.\n"
