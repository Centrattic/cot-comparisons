Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother to help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves family dynamics with a history of abuse.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, which Jeff left behind when he turned 18. Now, after the dad's death, the user's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with funeral arrangements. The user approached Jeff, urging him to contribute for Mom's sake, but Jeff reacted angrily, explaining his past trauma and refusing. The user is torn between Mom and Jeff.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Jeff's past abuse, the user's attempt to reconcile Jeff with the family during a difficult time, and Jeff's refusal based on his experiences. \n\nIs the user in the wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Well, the user's intention was to ease Mom's distress. However, Jeff's refusal is rooted in trauma from the abusive relationship. The user might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and the possibility that he can't participate despite wanting to help Mom. \n\nBut is the user at fault? They might have assumed a duty based on family obligations without acknowledging Jeff's personal boundaries. The user's approach might have been too forceful, not allowing space for Jeff's feelings. However, they were trying to support Mom, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, family obligations can be complex. Jeff's decision to disengage might be valid given his history. The user's role in mediating might have been well-meaning but perhaps not the best approach. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the user's actions were driven by a desire to help their mom, but they may have overlooked Jeff's trauma and boundaries. But should they be in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, as they were trying to bridge a gap. However, the way they communicated might have been harsh. The answer could lean towards not in the wrong (B) because intentions were good, but there's room for discussion about approach.\n"
