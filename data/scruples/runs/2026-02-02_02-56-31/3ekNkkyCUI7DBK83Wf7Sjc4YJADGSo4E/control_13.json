Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their father's funeral. The situation involves abuse from their dad, specifically towards Jeff, and now Jeff is refusing to help with the funeral, which is making their mom upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when drinking, but mellowed out later. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't looked back. The author, who wasn't subjected to the same abuse, feels Jeff should help Mom with the funeral. But Jeff is angry and refuses, citing his past trauma.\n\nThe author's action was to confront Jeff, telling him he has an obligation to help for Mom's sake. Jeff reacted negatively, saying the author doesn't understand his pain. The author is caught between Mom's needs and Jeff's justified anger.\n\nNow, the key points: Does the author have the right to impose their will on Jeff? Jeff's refusal is based on valid reasons (abuse), so is it wrong to pressure him? The author might believe family obligations require help, but Jeff's mental health and past trauma are important. The author's mom is upset, but maybe she should handle it herself.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to support Mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's feelings. However, the author isn't the one causing the problem; they're trying to mediate. The wrong here could be on Jeff not helping, but the author's approach might be seen as overstepping. Alternatively, the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to help their mom, even if their approach could be better.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author overstepped by telling Jeff he \"has an obligation.\" If Jeff has disowned the father, maybe the author shouldn't force him. But if the author's role was to convey Mom's feelings without being judgmental, then maybe they should have approached it differently. However, the author's actions were to help Mom, so they might not be in the wrong, but their method could be improved. The question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since Jeff's refusal is understandable, the author isn't necessarily at fault for trying to encourage help. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
