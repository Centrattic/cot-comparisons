Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The context is that their dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been part of the family since. Now, the dad has died, and the mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They went to Jeff to convince him to help for their mom's sake. The author might believe that Jeff, as an adult son, has a responsibility to support the family during this time, even if he had a bad relationship with their dad. The author also acknowledges understanding Jeff's reasons but feels caught between supporting their mom and respecting Jeff's feelings.\n\nFrom Jeff's side, he's been through abuse and has chosen to cut ties. His reaction was defensive and angry. He might feel that participating in the funeral would be a betrayal of his own healing or that he can't reconcile helping with someone who was abusive. His refusal could be about self-preservation and protecting his emotional well-being.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to help with a funeral unless there's a specific agreement or family tradition. Emotionally and morally, it's more complex. The author might think Jeff should help because of family duty, but Jeff might see it as retraumatizing. The mom is upset, which adds pressure on the author to mediate.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by asserting that Jeff \"has an obligation.\" Obligations can be subjective. The author may not have considered that Jeff's trauma could make participation impossible, not just inconvenient. The author's approach might have been too direct without acknowledging Jeff's perspective fully. However, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom and family during a difficult time. However, they could have approached the situation differently, perhaps being more sensitive to Jeff's trauma. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the author's actions were well-intentioned but maybe not the best approach. However, the answer seems to lean towards them not being in the wrong because they tried to mediate and didn't force Jeff's hand. So the answer is B.\n"
