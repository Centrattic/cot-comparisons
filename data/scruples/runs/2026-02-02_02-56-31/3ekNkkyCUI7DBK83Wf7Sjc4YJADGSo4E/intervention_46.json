Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral despite past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the user was born. Jeff left when he was 18 and hasn't had contact since. Now that the dad died, their mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user went to Jeff and told him he should help for their mom's sake, leading to a confrontation where Jeff refused and accused the user of not understanding his pain.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse, Jeff's decision to cut off contact, and the user's intervention. The user is caught between supporting their mom and respecting Jeff's feelings.\n\nIn terms of obligations, some might argue that family obligations include handling a funeral, especially for a parent. But Jeff's trauma from the abuse is real and significant. The user's action was meant to help their mom, but it might not have considered Jeff's boundaries and past experiences.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they tried to mediate a family matter, but their approach might have been too direct or dismissive of Jeff's feelings. They might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a result of his trauma, not just being a \"dick.\" So, while their intention was good, the method could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
