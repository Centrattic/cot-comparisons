Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral, given the history of abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, drinking a lot and being physically and emotionally abusive. He mellowed out when the author was born, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18, hasn't looked back. Now the dad is dead, and the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with funeral plans. The author tried to convince Jeff to help, which led to Jeff getting angry and refusing. The author is caught between their mom's needs and Jeff's understandable anger.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he should help. The key points here are the history of abuse, the obligation to help a parent's funeral, and the family dynamics. \n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But Jeff has a legitimate reason to be upset, given the abuse. The author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through, especially since he wasn't present for it. The author's approach might have been confrontational, telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which Jeff might see as invalidating his feelings.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they were trying to mediate a family conflict, perhaps without realizing the depth of Jeff's trauma. The obligation part could be problematic if Jeff doesn't feel he can or wants to participate. However, the author is in a tough spot, wanting to support their mom but also understanding Jeff's position. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had good intentions, but perhaps they could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The brother's refusal is due to valid reasons, so expecting him to help without acknowledging that might be wrong. The author's approach could have been more empathetic. But does that make them in the wrong? It's a judgment call. \n\nIn similar situations, people often debate whether pushing someone to participate in a funeral after abuse is wrong. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help, but the method might be questioned. However, the answer here is binary: A or B. Considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong because they're caught between two difficult sides, and their attempt was to help their mom. But Jeff's valid reasons mean the author might not have considered the emotional impact. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about effectiveness. So the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
