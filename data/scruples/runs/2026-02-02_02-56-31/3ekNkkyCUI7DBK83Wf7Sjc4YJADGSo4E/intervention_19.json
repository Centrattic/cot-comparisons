Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation is complicated because their dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, but when the user was born, the dad mellowed out. Jeff moved out when he was 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now, with the dad's death, their mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nThe user went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused. The user is now questioning if they did the right thing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The dad was abusive, so Jeff has legitimate reasons to be hurt and not want to participate. On the other hand, the mom is grieving and wants closure, needing support from both children. The user is trying to mediate here. \n\nThe user's action was telling Jeff he has an obligation. But Jeff's response was defensive and hostile. The user's intention was to help their mom, but they didn't consider whether Jeff's refusal is a valid boundary. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? The user might not be in the wrong because they acted out of concern for their mom. However, they should have considered Jeff's past trauma and maybe approached it differently, without implying obligation. Maybe the user should have been more empathetic to Jeff's feelings instead of pushing for obligation. \n\nBut is that being in the wrong? The user's action might be well-intentioned but maybe not the right approach. However, the question is whether they're \"in the wrong,\" which is a moral judgment. Since the user was trying to help their mom, they might not be in the wrong. Jeff's refusal is understandable, but the user's approach might have been heavy-handed. So perhaps the answer is B (No, not in the wrong) because their intentions were good, even if the execution could be better.\n"
