Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out later. Jeff left home as soon as he could and hasn't helped with the funeral plans. The user tried to convince Jeff, but he got angry and refused. Now the user is torn between their mom's needs and Jeff's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. Jeff had a traumatic experience with their dad, so his refusal might stem from valid emotional reasons. The user's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But does the user have the right to pressure Jeff into participating against his will? \n\nFuneral obligations can be culturally expected, but they're not legally binding. Each family member can choose their involvement. The user might be assuming Jeff has an obligation because of family ties, but if Jeff has chosen to cut off contact due to abuse, that's a personal decision. \n\nThe user's approach might have been confrontational. Telling Jeff he's \"making Mom super upset\" and calling him a \" dick\" could have escalated the situation. It's possible the user didn't consider Jeff's trauma and instead focused on the mother's needs, which might not be fair. \n\nOn the other hand, the user was trying to mediate a family conflict. They might not have realized the depth of Jeff's resentment. The mother's emotional state is valid, but forcing Jeff to participate could cause more harm. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They might have overstepped by pressuring Jeff without understanding his perspective. They could have approached it more empathetically, acknowledging Jeff's experiences and exploring why he's reluctant. Instead, they made demands, which led to conflict. Therefore, the answer might lean towards \"Yes,\" they are in the wrong for not considering Jeff's feelings and pushing for participation without understanding.\n"
