Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the narrator) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The narrator was born later and the father mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact, while the narrator stayed with mom. Now the father is dead, and mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The narrator went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help. The narrator is now stuck between mom and Jeff, unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are the obligation to help with a funeral, the history of abuse, and family dynamics. The author's argument is that Jeff has an obligation to help for Mom's sake, but Jeff feels justified in not helping because of the abuse.\n\nIs the author wrong to have told Jeff this? Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They were trying to support their mom, who is grieving and upset. The author might feel that as siblings, they should support each other during this time, even if there's past conflict. The author might believe that despite the abuse, the family should come together for the funeral.\n\nFrom Jeff's perspective: He has a history of abuse by their father. Forcing him to participate in the funeral could be traumatic or a violation of his boundaries. He might feel that honoring their father's funeral would be a betrayal of his own healing and respect for the abuse he suffered.\n\nEthically, family obligations can be complex. While some might say that siblings should support each other, especially for a parent's funeral, others argue that personal trauma and boundaries are valid reasons to opt out. The author's intention was to help Mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's emotional state or trauma.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. The author had a right to be concerned for their mom's feelings, but pushing Jeff to participate could be seen as invalidating his past experiences. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a form of self-preservation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach might have been insensitive. Instead of framing it as an obligation, maybe a more empathetic approach would have been better. However, the author's action was to encourage Jeff, not force him. But Jeff's reaction suggests that the author's message was not received as intended.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the obligation exists and whether the author's approach was appropriate. If the author should have respected Jeff's choice without trying to guilt-trip him, then they might be in the wrong. If the author was just trying to mediate between mom and Jeff, maybe they're not in the wrong.\n\nBut considering the history of abuse and the importance of mental health, it's possible that the author should have allowed Jeff to make his own decision without pressure. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for imposing an obligation on Jeff without considering his trauma.\n"
