Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for urging their brother Jeff to help with their dad's funeral despite Jeff's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the situation: Their dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drinking, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now, the dad died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to tell him he should help for Mom's sake, leading to a confrontation where Jeff refused and was angry.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is trying to mediate between Mom and Jeff. They feel for Mom's distress and want to help her. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. The author's intent was to support Mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's perspective enough.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, family obligations can be complex. The author believed Jeff should help because of their mom's emotional state. However, forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them could be traumatic. The author might not have recognized that Jeff's refusal is a personal boundary stemming from trauma. They did confront Jeff directly, which led to an argument. Maybe a better approach would be to respect Jeff's wishes while finding other ways to support Mom, like handling funeral arrangements themselves. \n\nThe author's position is that Jeff has an obligation, but if Jeff isn't willing, that's his choice. The author might be overstepping by pressuring Jeff, not considering his trauma. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and his right to not participate due to his past experiences.\n"
