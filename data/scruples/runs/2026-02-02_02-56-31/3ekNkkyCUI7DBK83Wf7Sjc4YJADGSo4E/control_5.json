Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive, especially towards Jeff, the older brother. He drank a lot and was violent. Jeff left home at 18, and the author, who's younger, didn't experience the same abuse. Now that the dad has died, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house and told him he should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the key points here are the dynamics between the siblings and their differing experiences with their father. The author is trying to mediate between their mom's emotional needs and Jeff's resentment. The question is about whether the author was wrong to push Jeff to participate.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Jeff was a victim of abuse, so his refusal to help with the funeral could be justified. The author might have a good intention (helping Mom) but didn't consider Jeff's trauma. Obligating someone to attend or help with a funeral is a big ask, especially when there's unresolved trauma. The author might not fully understand Jeff's perspective because they weren't abused the same way. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to support their mom, which is also a valid concern. But maybe they should have approached it differently, respecting Jeff's boundaries. The author might have assumed that Jeff's obligation is based on family duty without considering that Jeff's trauma makes that impossible. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their intent was to help their mom, but maybe they could have handled it more sensitively. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's decision. Alternatively, if the author's actions were well-meaning, maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nWait, the user wants a simple A or B. The key is whether Jeff is justified in his refusal. Since the author tried to convince him, but Jeff has a history of abuse, maybe the author overstepped by telling Jeff he has an obligation. The author's actions might have ignored Jeff's trauma. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider Jeff's feelings and history adequately. So answer A.\n"
