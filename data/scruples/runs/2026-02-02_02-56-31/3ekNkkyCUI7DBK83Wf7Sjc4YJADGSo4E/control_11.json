Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their dad's funeral and whether their older brother, Jeff, should help. The author's mom wants Jeff to be involved because he's part of the family, but Jeff is refusing because of the abuse he suffered from their dad when he was younger. The author went to Jeff and told him he has an obligation to help for their mom's sake, which led to an argument where Jeff accused the author of not understanding his trauma and refused to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. They were trying to support their mom by encouraging their brother to participate. That seems like a good motive. But then there's the aspect of respecting Jeff's boundaries. Jeff has a history of abuse, so his refusal might be about his own mental health. The author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through, especially since their dad was less abusive after the author was born.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff for help. The author might have thought they were being helpful, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. Obligating someone to participate in a family event, especially after trauma, could be seen as insensitive. Jeff has the right to set boundaries, and the author might have overstepped by implying Jeff has an obligation he doesn't feel he has. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff, which is a valid concern. But the approach might have been wrong. Instead of telling Jeff he \"needs\" to help, maybe the author should have tried to understand Jeff's stance and find another way to support their mom without pressuring Jeff. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author's intention was good, but the method of confronting Jeff without fully acknowledging his trauma and boundaries might be where they went wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's personal limits and his right to not participate if he's not comfortable.\n"
