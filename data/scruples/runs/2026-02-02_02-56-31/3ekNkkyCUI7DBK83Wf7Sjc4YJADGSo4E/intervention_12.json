Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. The situation is that their dad was abusive to their brother Jeff when he was younger, but improved after the user was born. Now, the dad has died, and Jeff refuses to help with the funeral, causing their mom distress. The user confronted Jeff, who got angry and refused to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The user is trying to mediate between their mom's needs and their brother's justified anger. The dad was abusive, so Jeff's refusal is understandable. But the mom is upset because she wants both her children to come together for the funeral. The user's intention was to help the mom, but they might have overstepped by telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" to help, which could be seen as dismissing his trauma.\n\nIs the user wrong? Well, they were trying to do the right thing by their mom, but maybe they didn't fully consider Jeff's feelings. Obligation might not be the right approach when dealing with trauma. The user might not be in the wrong for trying to help, but perhaps they could have been more empathetic towards Jeff's perspective. However, the answer depends on whether the user's approach was respectful. They did express understanding that Jeff has a lot to deal with but still pushed for obligation, which might not be the best way. \n\nIn cases like this, there's no clear right or wrong. The user's intentions were good, but the method might have been flawed. The key is whether they respected Jeff's boundaries. Since Jeff has a valid reason for not wanting to participate, the user might not be in the wrong, but they could have handled it more sensitively. So maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because they were trying to mediate, but the approach could be debated. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if they forced obligation without considering Jeff's trauma. Hmm. I think B makes more sense here because the user's intention was to help their mom, and they did acknowledge Jeff's feelings, even if their approach wasn't perfect.\n"
