Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, but after the user was born, he mellowed out, possibly due to sobriety. Jeff left home as soon as he could, at 18, and hasn't been in touch. The mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user went to Jeff's house to convince him, and Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help. The user is now conflicted between their mom and Jeff's feelings.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong. They were following their mom's request to reach out. But Jeff's anger is due to past trauma. Obligating someone to participate in a funeral for someone they were abused by might be a sensitive issue. The user might feel it's about family duty, but Jeff's experience is different. The user didn't push for reconciliation, just asked for help with the funeral. But Jeff's refusal is based on his negative experiences. \n\nIs the user wrong? Well, they were trying to help their mom, which is understandable. However, they might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and past trauma. The user's approach could be seen as imposing expectations without considering Jeff's perspective. But is that their fault entirely? The user felt for their mom but also acknowledges Jeff's reasons. So maybe it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points.\n\nIn some cases, people have the right to distance themselves from abusive family members. The user's intent was good, but Jeff's refusal is a personal choice. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to mediate, but maybe the way they approached it could have been more empathetic. However, the question is about obligation. If the user is suggesting that Jeff is obligated, but Jeff doesn't feel that way, it's a matter of perspective. The user's actions might be well-meaning, but Jeff's decision to not help is his own. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No), but with nuances. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting to help their mom, but they might not have handled it perfectly. The key is that Jeff's past experience with the dad gives him the right to refuse, even if the user finds it unfair. The user's attempt to mediate is understandable, but it's not their fault for trying. They might have expected Jeff to be more receptive, but that's not accounting for his trauma. Therefore, the user isn't at fault, but the situation is complex.\n"
