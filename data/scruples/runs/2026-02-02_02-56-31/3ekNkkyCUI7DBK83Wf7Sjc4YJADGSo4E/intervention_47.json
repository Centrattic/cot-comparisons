Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff when he was younger. The user's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and when the user tried to convince Jeff, he got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the user's argument is that Jeff should help for Mom's sake. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to be involved because of the abuse. The user is caught between their mom and brother. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if making Jeff help is fair. Since the father was abusive, Jeff might not feel any obligation. The user might not realize the emotional trauma Jeff has. But the mom is upset, so the user is trying to help her. \n\nOn the other hand, pushing Jeff to participate could be invalidating his feelings. The user might have assumed Jeff's obligation without understanding his perspective. But they did mention Jeff's past, so maybe they do understand but still think Mom needs support.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the user should have respected Jeff's choice. Since Jeff has a history of abuse and chose to cut ties, the user might be in the right for trying to mediate, but maybe overstepped by imposing obligation. However, the user's intention was for Mom's sake, which is understandable. \n\nMaybe the right answer is B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help their mom, but it's a sensitive situation. However, if the user didn't consider Jeff's trauma enough, maybe A. But the user did acknowledge Jeff's reasons. So, B might be the better choice here.\n"
