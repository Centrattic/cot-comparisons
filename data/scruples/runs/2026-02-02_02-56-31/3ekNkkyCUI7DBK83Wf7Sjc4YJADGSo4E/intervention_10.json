Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral, even though their brother had a bad experience with their dad. Let me think about the key points here.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was younger. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved since. After the user was born, the dad mellowed out, maybe due to sobriety. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with funeral arrangements. The user went to Jeff to convince him, and Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help. Now the user is torn between their mom and Jeff's feelings.\n\nSo, is the user at fault? Well, the user's intention was to help the mom, which is understandable. They might have thought Jeff, as a sibling, should contribute. But Jeff has a valid reason to be upset given the abuse. The user might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma. However, the user was trying to mediate a family matter, which can be tricky. Did they overstep? Maybe. But they were trying to support their mom. \n\nOn the other hand, Jeff's reaction is extreme, but his reasons are rooted in past trauma. The user might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a protective mechanism. The user's approach could have been more empathetic, acknowledging Jeff's pain first before asking for help. But was it wrong to ask Jeff to help for the mom's sake? Maybe not entirely, but perhaps the way they approached it could have been better. \n\nI think the user's intention was good, but the execution might have missed the mark. The answer might be that they're not in the wrong because they were trying to help, but they could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since Jeff's refusal is based on justified trauma, the user might have overstepped by implying an obligation. So maybe the answer is AITA? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, in some cultures, family obligations are expected regardless of past issues, so the user's stance might be seen as correct. It's a bit of a toss-up. I need to weigh empathy for Jeff's past versus the family duty. The user's role was to mediate, and they might not be wrong for trying. But pushing Jeff to help against his will could be wrong. I think the answer is that they're not in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but they should have been more sensitive to Jeff's feelings. So the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
