Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral despite past abuse. \n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when drinking. After the user was born, the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18, hasn't had contact since. Now the dad is dead, and the user's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nThe user went to Jeff to convince him to help for their mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help because of the abuse he suffered. The user is torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user did the right thing. \n\nArguments for AITA (A: Yes in the wrong): The user might have forced Jeff into a situation he's not comfortable with. Jeff has valid reasons to not want to participate. Pressuring him could make him resent the user and mom more. The user might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff experienced.\n\nArguments against AITA (B: Not in the wrong): The user was trying to help their mom who's grieving and needs support. They might think family should come together despite past issues. The user's intention was to ease mom's burden, not to force Jeff into something, but maybe they should have approached it differently.\n\nThe key points are intent vs. outcome. The user's intent was good, but they didn't consider Jeff's trauma. Maybe they should have suggested other ways Jeff could help without being directly involved in the funeral. It's about respecting Jeff's boundaries while still helping mom. The user's action was well-meaning but perhaps not the best approach. So, there's a case for both sides, but I think the user did what they thought was right to help their mom, even if the method could have been better. So, maybe they aren't in the wrong.\n"
