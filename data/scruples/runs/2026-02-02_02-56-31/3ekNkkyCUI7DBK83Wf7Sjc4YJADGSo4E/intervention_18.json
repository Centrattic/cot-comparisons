Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff. The user's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The user went to talk to Jeff and told him he needs to stop being a dick and help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the user is caught between their mom and brother. They feel for Jeff because he had a terrible time with dad, but Mom is hurting. The question is whether the user did the wrong thing by insisting Jeff help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Jeff has a right to not engage with the funeral if he doesn't want to, especially given the abuse. The user's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But maybe forcing Jeff to participate could reopen old wounds. However, the user's mom is grieving and might need support from both children.\n\nBut was it the user's place to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation\"? That might be the key. Obligations can be subjective here. Jeff might feel no obligation due to the abuse. The user tried to mediate, but Jeff's response was hostile. The user didn't push further after Jeff's outburst, which is good.\n\nOn the other hand, the user was trying to help their mom, which is a valid concern. But maybe the user should have approached it differently, respecting Jeff's boundaries. The user might not be in the wrong, but maybe they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not if they could have done better.\n\nConsidering all, the user's action came from a place of trying to support their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's trauma. However, since the user was following their mom's request, maybe they're not at fault. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because their intentions were good, even if the outcome was negative. Alternatively, if enforcing an obligation without considering Jeff's feelings is wrong, then A. But the complexity here makes it a tough call. I think the user isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
