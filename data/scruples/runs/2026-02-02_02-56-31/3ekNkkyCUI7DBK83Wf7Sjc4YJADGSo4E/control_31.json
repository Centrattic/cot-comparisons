Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their dad, who was abusive to their older brother Jeff when he was younger but mellowed out after the author was born. Now the dad has died, and the author is telling Jeff that he should help with the funeral for their mom's sake. Jeff gets angry and refuses, and the author is wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider each person's perspective. The author went to Jeff to convince him to help, probably thinking that it's important for their mom to have family support, especially since Jeff left when he was 18 and hasn't been involved. The author might feel responsible because they're younger and Jeff is the older brother, but they're asking Jeff to take some responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. He was abused by their dad when he was younger, and the author acknowledges that Jeff's experiences were real and traumatic. Jeff might feel that honoring someone who was abusive to him is not something he's willing to do, even if the dad improved later. The author's approach might have been too direct or not empathetic enough towards Jeff's feelings.\n\nThe author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author is caught in the middle. The key points here are the author's justification for Jeff's obligation and whether they respected Jeff's past trauma. Obligations in family matters can be complex, especially after abuse. The author might not realize that Jeff's decision is rooted in his own healing and boundaries, not just being a \"dick\" as Jeff put it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They tried to mediate a family conflict, which is commendable, but maybe they didn't fully consider Jeff's perspective when they told him he had an obligation. Obligations can be subjective, especially in cases of abuse. The author might have assumed Jeff's responsibility without understanding his reasons, leading to the confrontation. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been more sensitive. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since Jeff's trauma is valid and the author pushed for involvement without considering his feelings, there's a case to say the author overstepped. Alternatively, the author was trying to help their mom, which is a valid concern too. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to support their mom and may not have fully realized the depth of Jeff's resentment. However, their approach could have been more empathetic. But since they had a genuine intent to help their mother and might not have known how Jeff felt, the responsibility isn't entirely on them. The main issue is Jeff's refusal, but the author's actions were motivated by their mom's well-being, which is understandable.\n"
