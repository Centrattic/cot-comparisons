Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when drinking. The user wasn't around as much when the abuse happened, and Jeff left home early. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user tried to convince Jeff, but he got angry and refused to help.\n\nThe user is caught between their mom's needs and Jeff's justified anger. The question is whether the user was wrong to push Jeff to help. \n\nOn one side, the user was trying to support their mom, who's grieving. It's natural to want to help the parent who's distressed. On the other side, Jeff has a history of trauma from the dad. Forcing him to participate might be invalidating his feelings and his right to disengage from someone who caused him harm.\n\nAbuse survivors often have complex feelings about the abuser, even after death. The user might not fully understand Jeff's trauma, as they were a child when the abuse happened. Telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" might come off as dismissive of his experiences. It's possible the user didn't consider that Jeff might need to distance himself for his mental health.\n\nHowever, the user's intent was to help their mom, which is a valid concern. But maybe there's a different way to approach it, like respecting Jeff's choice while still supporting mom. The user might have been in a tough spot, but the approach could have been more sensitive.\n\nSo, considering the context, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't account for Jeff's trauma and instead imposed an obligation. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong), but I need to check again. Alternatively, if the user's action was out of a good place but the method was flawed, maybe it's a gray area. But the user explicitly told Jeff he has an obligation, which could be the issue. The answer is likely A.\n"
