Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to their older brother Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out when the user was born. Now the dad has died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nSo the user went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused. The user is caught between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's feelings. The question is whether the user was wrong to push Jeff to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive, especially towards Jeff. Jeff left home early and hasn't been back. The user didn't experience the same abuse, so they might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma. When the user told Jeff he should help for their mom's sake, Jeff reacted strongly, which makes sense given his past. \n\nThe user's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But they might not have considered Jeff's perspective. The user might have assumed that because Jeff was their brother, he had an obligation, not realizing the emotional impact of the abuse. Jeff's refusal is a valid reaction; he might not feel any duty to a father who was abusive. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is grieving and wants closure, so the user's effort to support her is also valid. However, the user's approach could have been more empathetic. Instead of framing it as an obligation, maybe they should have tried to understand Jeff's reasons and find another way to support their mom without pressuring Jeff beyond his comfort level.\n\nSo, was the user in the wrong? They might have been too quick to assert Jeff's obligation without considering his past trauma. They should have approached the situation with more understanding and possibly sought a compromise. Therefore, the answer might be AITA (Yes, in the wrong), but depends on the reasoning. The user's intent was good, but the execution could have been better. They should have considered Jeff's feelings more deeply before confronting him.\n"
