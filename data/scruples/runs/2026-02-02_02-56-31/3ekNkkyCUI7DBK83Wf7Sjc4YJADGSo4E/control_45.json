Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The author wasn't around for that because their dad mellowed out after they were born. Now that the dad died, their mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff and told him he should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff was angry and refused.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother's past abuse by the father, the author's lack of direct experience with that abuse, the mom's emotional state, and the author's intervention.\n\nThe author's argument is that they did it for their mom's sake. But Jeff might feel that the author doesn't understand his trauma and is pressuring him to participate in a funeral for someone who hurt him. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, everyone has the right to their own feelings about their parent. Even if the parent was abusive, some people choose to honor or disconnect, and others might feel obligated by family. The author's intention was to help their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's emotional boundaries.\n\nThe author could be in the wrong if they didn't respect Jeff's autonomy and feelings. But if they were trying to mediate and didn't force Jeff, maybe not. However, telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" might imply that he must help, which could be seen as imposing. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is his right, given the history.\n\nAlso, the author might not fully grasp the impact of the abuse on Jeff, especially since they weren't around for it. So, maybe the author's approach was well-intentioned but misguided. They might be in the wrong for assuming Jeff should help, not considering his trauma, and not respecting his decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to support their mom, which is a valid concern. But the method of telling Jeff he's obligated might not be the right approach. There's a balance between respecting family and respecting individual trauma.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't account for Jeff's traumatic experience and his right to refuse. Obligating someone to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them can be seen as dismissive of their feelings. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance. However, the key here is the author's assumption of obligation without considering Jeff's perspective. So A.\n"
