Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by telling their older brother Jeff that he should help with their abusive father's funeral. The key points are the father's history of abuse towards Jeff, Jeff moving out immediately after turning 18, and now not wanting to participate in the funeral.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to help their mom, who's upset that Jeff isn't contributing. The user approached Jeff, explaining the mother's feelings and urging him to help. Jeff responded angrily, indicating he has valid reasons from his past. \n\nThe user is caught between mom's emotional needs and Jeff's justified anger. The question is whether the user was wrong in pressing Jeff to participate. \n\nOn one hand, the user might feel they were advocating for their mom's well-being. On the other, Jeff's trauma and decision to cut ties with his father are significant. Forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them could be harmful. The user might not have considered Jeff's perspective deeply enough, assuming he should put aside past trauma for the funeral. \n\nHowever, the user might have thought they were balancing mom's needs without overstepping. But given the abuse history, Jeff's refusal is understandable. The user's approach could be seen as not respecting Jeff's boundaries, especially if the father's abuse was real and ongoing. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user overstepped by expecting Jeff to help despite his traumatic experiences. Since the father was abusive, Jeff's refusal is valid. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's decision and boundaries.\n"
