Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive towards their brother Jeff, especially when he drank. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in touch. Now that dad's died, the user's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user tried to convince Jeff, but he got angry and refused. The user is torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's reasons.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the brother's past trauma from the abusive father. Jeff might be justified in not wanting to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to him. The user's mom is in a tough spot too, grieving and needing support from both her children. But the user is caught in the middle. \n\nThe user's action was to tell Jeff he should help for their mom's sake. But Jeff has valid reasons for refusing. The user might have overstepped by implying obligation without considering Jeff's trauma. But maybe they were just trying to help their mom. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, they were trying to mediate, but maybe they should have considered Jeff's feelings more. However, they were also trying to help their mother. It's a complex situation. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they had good intentions to support their mom, but maybe they could have approached it differently. But since Jeff's trauma is a valid reason, the user might not be in the wrong for trying to help. But maybe they should have been more empathetic towards Jeff's stance. \n\nI think the answer is B. The user isn't in the wrong, but they need to handle it more sensitively.\n"
