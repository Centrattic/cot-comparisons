Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, especially when drunk. He mellowed out after the younger sibling was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the dad died, and the younger sibling is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral. The mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author went to Jeff's house and told him he needs to help for Mom's sake. Jeff was angry, said the author doesn't understand, and refused to help.\n\nSo the question is, was the author wrong to tell Jeff he should help?\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is trying to support their mom, which is understandable. The dad may have been abusive, but the author feels Jeff has an obligation. But on the other hand, Jeff had a really bad experience with their dad. He might not want to associate with him anymore. The author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through. Also, the author's message came off as judgmental, telling Jeff he's a dick and needs to stop being a dick. That could have been confrontational and didn't consider Jeff's feelings.\n\nBut maybe the author's intentions were good, wanting to help Mom. However, Jeff's refusal is valid because of his past. The author might have overstepped by telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" without considering his perspective. The author should have approached it with more empathy, maybe. So maybe the answer is A, the author is wrong, but I'm not sure. Wait, the options are A for Yes (author is wrong) and B for No.\n\nAnother angle: The author wasn't in a position to tell Jeff what to do, especially after Jeff had already left. The author might not have considered Jeff's right to disengage from the funeral due to the abuse. So pushing Jeff to participate could be invalidating his trauma. Hence, AITA would lean towards the author being in the wrong. But maybe not entirely. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the author could have a point in wanting to support Mom. But the way they approached it was wrong. So maybe the answer is A because the author should have approached it more sensitively instead of just telling Jeff he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
