Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now that the dad died, their mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but he got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the author's main point is that they think Jeff should help for their mom's sake. But Jeff feels he's not responsible because of the past abuse. The question is whether the author is wrong to push Jeff.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is trying to support their mom, which is a valid reason. However, Jeff might have valid reasons to not want to participate after being abused. The author might not have considered Jeff's feelings or boundaries. \n\nObligations can be subjective here. The author assumes Jeff has an obligation, but Jeff might not feel that way. The author might have overstepped by telling Jeff he \"needs to contribute\" without considering his feelings. \n\nAlso, the author's approach led to conflict. Maybe they should have respected Jeff's decision instead of trying to convince him. The key points are empathy and boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help their mom, but maybe in how they approached Jeff. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the obligation is real. Since Jeff had a traumatic experience, the author might not be wrong to try to involve him, but if they forced the issue without understanding, maybe they are. However, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. \n\nHmm. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but they could have handled it better. But according to the options, it's A or B. The user is asking for a yes or no. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the person in the wrong if they forced responsibility on someone with a history of trauma. Since Jeff has a valid reason to not help, the author might not be in the wrong for suggesting he should, but maybe they are if they insisted on it. But the author's mom is upset, so it's a family matter. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they were trying to support their mom and might not have known the full extent of Jeff's trauma. However, maybe the author should have respected Jeff's choice. It's a bit of a toss-up. But the key is that the author's actions were in good faith, even if they could have handled it more sensitively. So the answer is B.\n"
