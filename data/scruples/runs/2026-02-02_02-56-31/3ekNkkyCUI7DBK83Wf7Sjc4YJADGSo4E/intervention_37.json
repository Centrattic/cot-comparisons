Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, but mellowed out after the user was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in touch much. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The user went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the user's main point is that they told Jeff he should help for their mom's sake. The question is whether the user was in the wrong.\n\nFrom Jeff's perspective, he has valid reasons to be angry. His father was abusive, and he might not want to honor someone who treated him so badly. The user is trying to reconcile their mom's need for help with Jeff's justified resentment. The user's approach might have been too direct, especially telling Jeff he has an \"obligation,\" which Jeff took as a personal attack.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is trying to support their mom, who is grieving. They might not have considered how their words would make Jeff feel, possibly invalidating his past trauma. The user could have approached it more empathetically, acknowledging Jeff's feelings while still encouraging him to help for the mom's sake.\n\nThe key here is whether the user's approach was respectful of Jeff's emotions. By framing it as an obligation and criticizing Jeff as being a \"dick,\" the user might have pushed Jeff's buttons. The user might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting to help their mom, but their method could have been better. So, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because of how they communicated, but maybe not entirely. However, given the context, the user's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But the way they approached Jeff could have been more considerate. The answer is tricky, but I think A is more appropriate because the user didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough in their message.\n"
