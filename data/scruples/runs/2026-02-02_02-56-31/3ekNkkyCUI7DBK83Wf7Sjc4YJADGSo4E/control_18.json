Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is at fault for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their father's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: Jeff had a very abusive upbringing with their dad, who was an alcoholic and physically abusive. The author, being younger, didn't experience the same abuse but knows about it from Jeff and their mom. The dad died, and the author and mom want Jeff to help with the funeral, but Jeff refuses, citing the abuse he suffered. The author confronted Jeff, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are about obligation and empathy. The author believes Jeff has a duty to help for his mom's sake, but Jeff feels he can't reconcile with someone who was abusive. The author's actions were motivated by wanting to support their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's trauma.\n\nLegally or morally, there's no obligation for someone to attend or help with a family member's funeral they had a bad relationship with. The author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is a valid response to past trauma. By confronting Jeff, the author might have dismissed his feelings, which could be seen as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to mediate a family conflict and support their mom, which is understandable. However, the approach might have been wrong. The author could have tried to understand Jeff's perspective more before insisting on his participation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance. They acted out of concern for their mom but didn't fully acknowledge Jeff's reasons. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the intention was good, but the execution could have been better. However, depending on the perspective, some might argue A, but given the context, B seems more accurate.\n"
