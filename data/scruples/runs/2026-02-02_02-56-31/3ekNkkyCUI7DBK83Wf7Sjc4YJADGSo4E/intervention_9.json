Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for pressuring their brother Jeff to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, but mellowed out when the user was born. Jeff hasn't helped with the funeral, and the user tried to convince him, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive, which is a serious issue. Jeff had a traumatic experience and moved out early, which might explain his reluctance to participate in the funeral. The user's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the user is caught in the middle.\n\nThe user's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved, which is understandable. However, they didn't consider Jeff's valid feelings about their dad's past abuse. Forcing someone to participate in a funeral against their will, especially given traumatic history, could be seen as insensitive. The user might not have fully respected Jeff's right to choose not to be involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the user was trying to support their mom's emotional needs. It's a tough balance between respecting a brother's wishes and supporting a parent. The user's approach might have been too direct, leading to Jeff's anger. Maybe a more empathetic approach, acknowledging Jeff's past, could have been better. But was the user in the wrong? They had good intentions but might have overlooked Jeff's perspective. So, maybe answer A (yes) because they pressured Jeff without fully understanding his feelings. Alternatively, answer B (no) if the user's motivation was to help their mom, and they had a right to try, even if it didn't work out.\n\nI think the key is whether the user's actions were wrong in pressuring Jeff. Since Jeff has legitimate reasons to not want to participate, the user might have been inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
