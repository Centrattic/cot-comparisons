Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, which Jeff clearly remembers. After the author was born, the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. The mom stayed with the dad despite the abuse. Now the dad is dead, and the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him to help, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is now conflicted between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's perspective.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse, the differing experiences between Jeff and the author, and the author's role in trying to mediate. The question is whether the author was right to push Jeff to help, given Jeff's past.\n\nI think the author's intention was good\u2014to help their mom. But they might not have considered Jeff's trauma. The author might be assuming that because their dad was less abusive to them, Jeff should still help. But Jeff could feel that the dad was a terrible person and doesn't deserve a proper funeral. The author might not realize that their brother's refusal is a valid reaction to past abuse.\n\nAlso, the author's approach might have been confrontational, which led to Jeff getting defensive. Maybe they should have approached it more empathetically, acknowledging Jeff's pain first. However, is the author in the wrong for trying to help their mom? It's a tough spot because family obligations can be complex. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but they might have handled it poorly. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for the action itself, not the method. Since the author's mom is grieving, the author felt it was their duty to reach out. But considering Jeff's justified anger, maybe the author overstepped. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. Wait, but maybe the author didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough. Hmm. Alternatively, since Jeff chose to cut ties, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to reconcile. I think the answer is B, not in the wrong. The obligation part is debatable, but the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. Jeff's refusal is his choice, but the author isn't wrong for trying.\n"
