Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff he needs to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, but mellowed out later. Jeff moved out when he was 18, hasn't helped with the funeral, and got angry when the user asked him to. The user's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The dad was abusive, which is a serious issue. Jeff had a traumatic experience and may have justified reasons for not wanting to participate. The user tried to mediate by asking Jeff to help for their mom's sake. But Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? The user's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. They might feel they're upholding family obligations. However, they didn't consider Jeff's trauma. Forcing someone to participate in a funeral, especially after abuse, could be harmful. The user's approach might have been too direct, not acknowledging Jeff's feelings. \n\nThe key points are: the dad's abuse history, Jeff's valid reasons for not wanting to help, and the user's attempt to balance mom's needs. The user's right to intervene vs. respecting Jeff's trauma. \n\nIn terms of ethics, family obligations can be complex. If Jeff is unwilling, the user might be pushing without understanding. But the user also isn't wrong for trying to help their mom. It's a nuanced situation. However, the user might have overstepped by not considering Jeff's perspective. So, maybe they're not in the wrong, but their approach could be better. But according to the question, the answer should be A or B. Given the circumstances, the user's intention was good, but the method might not be the best. However, the core question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they acted out of concern for their mom and tried to mediate, maybe B is the answer. But if the user's action disregarded Jeff's trauma, then A. It's tricky, but I think B. They aren't in the wrong for trying to help their mom, even if Jeff is right to say no.\n"
