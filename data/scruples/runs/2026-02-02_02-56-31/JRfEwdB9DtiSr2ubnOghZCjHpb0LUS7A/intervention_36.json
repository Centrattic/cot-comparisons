He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The friend, Jake, is really struggling, and the user let his daughter stay but not him. The friend then slept on the streets, and the user's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The user probably thought they were helping by pushing Jake to cope, but maybe they didn't realize the immediate need for support. Jake was in a fragile state, and leaving him alone could lead to bad decisions. The user's intention was good, but the action might have been too harsh. Allowing both Jake and his daughter might have been better. The user's wife is upset because they felt they abandoned their friend when he needed help. The user should have considered that Jake's mental state might require more support, not just pushing independence. So, the answer is A, meaning they are in the wrong.\n"
