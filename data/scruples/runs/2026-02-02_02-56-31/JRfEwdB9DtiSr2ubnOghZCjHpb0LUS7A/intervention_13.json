He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the user's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling. He's been drinking and sleeping a lot, and now he showed up at the user's house late at night with his daughter. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake ended up on the streets.\n\nHmm, the user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief. But the wife called them an asshole. Well, Jake is in a really tough spot. His house is full of memories, and he's taking sleeping pills. Even though the user's intention was to push Jake to cope, refusing to let him stay might have left him without a safe place. The user allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but Jake was left to sleep on the streets. That seems harsh, especially given his mental state. He might be at risk of self-harm or not taking care of himself. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might have thought that enabling him to stay would prevent him from dealing with his grief. But when someone is in crisis, especially with mental health issues, sometimes immediate support is necessary even if it's short-term. The user's approach was more about pushing him to get over it rather than helping him through it. Maybe they should have set boundaries but offered help, like staying in a separate room or involving other friends or professionals. \n\nThe key points are Jake's state of mind, the child's safety, and the user's response. The user did allow the daughter to stay, which is responsible. But not accommodating Jake, who was in severe emotional distress, might have been a mistake. The user's intention was good, but the execution could have been better. They might have not considered the immediate risks Jake was facing. So maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong because they didn't provide necessary support during a crisis.\n"
