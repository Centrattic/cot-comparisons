He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their friend stay over after his wife died. The friend has a 3-year-old daughter. The user opened the door for the daughter but not the dad.\n\nFirst, the friend is clearly in a very difficult situation. Grieving is hard, and he's not handling it well. He's drinking, sleeping a lot, and even taking sleeping pills. The user's reasoning was to help him get over his grief by not letting him stay. But the friend then went to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous, especially with a young child.\n\nThe user's wife is upset, calling them an asshole. The user argues their intention wasn't to put him on the streets but to help. But the outcome was harmful. The friend left the daughter asleep and went out, which might suggest he wasn't thinking clearly due to grief and possible substance use.\n\nSo, the dilemma here is between supporting a grieving friend and setting boundaries. The user did allow the child to stay, which is good, but not offering support to the father could be seen as neglecting his needs. Grief can be overwhelming, and sometimes people need help, even if they're not in a good state. The user might have thought they were helping by pushing him to cope, but in reality, they might have ignored his immediate need for support during a vulnerable time.\n\nI think the user's approach was harsh. When someone is grieving, especially with mental health issues, they might need more compassion and practical help, like a temporary place to stay. By not allowing the father to stay, they might have left him in a worse situation. Even if the intention was good, the action didn't address the friend's real crisis. The friend's reaction was extreme, but the user could have found another way to support both him and his daughter. So, the answer is probably that the user is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
