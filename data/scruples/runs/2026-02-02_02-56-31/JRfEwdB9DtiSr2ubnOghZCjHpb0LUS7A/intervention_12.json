He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend sleep over after the friend's wife died. The friend, Jake, is clearly struggling\u2014depressed, drinking, taking sleeping pills. He showed up at their door with his daughter, and the user let the daughter stay but told Jake he couldn't. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets. The user's wife is upset, but the user thinks they were trying to help.\n\nHmm, the key points here. The user's intention was to help Jake get through his grief, but their action might have inadvertently harmed him. Let me break it down. First, Jake's mental health is critical. He's in a fragile state, dealing with loss and possibly considering self-harm. The user's response was to deny Jake shelter but allow his daughter. That might have pushed him to a breaking point. Did the user consider that Jake might need immediate support instead of being told to \"get over it\"? \n\nAlso, the user's approach could be seen as dismissive of Jake's current emotional state. Even if the intention was to help, the method was confrontational. Instead of sending a message that he's on his own, maybe the user should have offered a safer alternative. For example, suggesting a shelter or staying with another friend. The user's wife called them an asshole, which suggests that the community might see this as neglecting responsibility towards a friend in crisis.\n\nBut the user argues that their intention was good. However, in such situations, the action matters more than intent. If Jake is a risk to himself or his daughter, the user's refusal without providing another solution could be seen as harmful. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets is a consequence that reflects poorly on the user's decision. Even if they didn't want that, not anticipating the outcome shows a lack of empathy or understanding of Jake's state.\n\nMoreover, as a best friend, there's an expectation of support. Telling him he has to \"get over it eventually\" sounds dismissive of his grief. Grief isn't something you just get over quickly. The user might have thought they were pushing Jake to move on, but that's not appropriate. Instead, support should be about being there during the grieving process. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intention was to help, their action didn't provide the necessary support and might have contributed to Jake's worsening situation. Therefore, they are likely in the wrong.\n"
