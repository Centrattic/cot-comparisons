He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the author made a mistake by not letting their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is dealing with a significant loss and is clearly struggling\u2014depressed, drinking, and even taking sleeping pills. He showed up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking for help. The author allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake. That led to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by forcing him to cope. But is that the right approach? When someone is in severe emotional distress, especially after a traumatic event like a spouse's death, they often need support and understanding. The author might think they're pushing Jake to be strong, but maybe that's not the right way. \n\nJake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, being unable to be in his house\u2014suggest he's in a crisis. The author's refusal to let him stay could be seen as not providing necessary support. Even though the intention wasn't to let him sleep outside, the consequence was that he ended up there, which is dangerous, especially considering he has a young daughter. \n\nThe author's wife called them an asshole, which might indicate that their approach was harsh. The author's friends or family might expect more empathy here. Also, the daughter's well-being is a factor. If Jake isn't in a state to take care of her, maybe the author should have considered alternative solutions, like contacting other family or authorities if necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did allow the child to stay, which is a positive step. They might be overwhelmed by the situation and not sure how to handle it. But in a crisis, people need support, not being turned away. The line between helping someone heal and abandoning them can be thin here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's lack of support might have contributed to Jake's decision to sleep on the streets. Even if the intention was good, the action didn't provide the necessary help during a critical time. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not offering more support when it was clearly needed.\n"
