He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're at fault for not allowing their best friend to stay overnight after his wife died. Here's the breakdown:\n\nFirst, the situation is emotional. Jake is grieving, his wife died, and he's struggling\u2014drinking, sleeping a lot. He tried to stay at the user's house but was told no, which led to him sleeping on the street. The user's reasoning was to help him move past his grief. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user was wrong. On one hand, the user's intention was to help Jake, maybe thinking that staying there would prevent him from dealing with his emotions. But on the other hand, not providing a safe space for someone in crisis could be seen as neglecting their immediate needs. Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the user's refusal might have pushed him to a worse situation. \n\nThe user's wife is upset, and the user is justifying their actions. But maybe they didn't consider all the consequences. Even if the intention was good, denying shelter to someone who's emotionally unstable and has a child might be irresponsible. There's also the aspect of being a good friend during a crisis. \n\nHowever, the user might have thought they were doing the right thing by not enabling avoidance. But forcing someone to stay in a harmful environment isn't the solution. Maybe a better approach would be to offer support while encouraging healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might have intended to help, but the action could be seen as wrong because they didn't provide necessary support. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
