He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight after his wife died. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake lost his wife in a car crash. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, drinking, and sleeping a lot. He tried to crash at the user's house with his daughter. The user allowed the daughter but not Jake, thinking he needs to get over it. Then Jake went to the streets after leaving the user's place. The user's wife is upset, but the user thinks they did the right thing.\n\nHmm, the key points here are empathy, support, and the user's reasoning. The user's intention was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his situation. But Jake ended up on the streets, which is a bad outcome. \n\nI need to consider if the user should have been more compassionate. Even if the user thought Jake needed to face his grief, turning him away without a better plan might have been harsh. Especially since he has a young child to care for. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which might have separated the child from the parent, which is not ideal. \n\nAlso, the user's wife is upset, indicating that her support was important. Maybe the user could have found another solution, like staying in contact, offering resources, or helping him find temporary housing instead of just refusing. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might have had legitimate reasons, like their own space and considering Jake's long-term coping. But the immediate consequence was Jake being homeless, which is a serious issue. The user's approach could be seen as lacking support during a time when Jake needed more help.\n\nI think the user might be in the wrong (A) because they didn't provide adequate support, leading to a negative outcome. However, there's nuance. The user might not have intended harm but failed to consider Jake's immediate needs. It's a tough balance between helping someone face their grief and providing necessary support.\n"
