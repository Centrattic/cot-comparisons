He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The situation is that Jake, the friend, is really struggling with grief, and he showed up at their house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The user said the daughter could stay but not Jake, which made Jake leave. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the user's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the reasoning here. The user's intention was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his house. But did they go too far? Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the user's refusal might have pushed him to a breaking point. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was that Jake slept on the street, which is dangerous and potentially harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might feel they were trying to be strong to help Jake face his reality. But in a crisis, sometimes people need support and shelter, not just being told to \"get over it.\" The user's decision could be seen as not providing necessary support when a friend needed it most. Also, Jake's daughter was allowed to stay, but the user's refusal to let Jake in might have led to him leaving the daughter alone to sleep and then going out to the streets. That could be dangerous for the child as well, though the user might not have realized that at the time.\n\nThe user's wife is upset, which adds to the conflict. The user's perspective is that they were trying to help, but the friend's actions afterward suggest that the refusal had negative consequences. The key points here are about empathy, the immediate needs of a grieving person, and whether the user's approach was too harsh.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, sometimes in grief, people need a safe space to process, and pushing them to face their environment without support might not be helpful. The user might not have considered that Jake needed temporary respite to prevent a breakdown. The fact that Jake took sleeping pills also indicates he's at risk, so the user's refusal could have been a failure to provide necessary support. \n\nSo, while the user's intention was to help by encouraging resilience, the outcome was harmful. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not considering the immediate emotional and physical safety of their friend and his daughter.\n"
