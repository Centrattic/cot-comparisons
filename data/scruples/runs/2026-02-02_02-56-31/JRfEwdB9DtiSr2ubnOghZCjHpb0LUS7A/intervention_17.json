He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife died. So Jake's wife died in a car crash, and he's really struggling. He's been drinking, sleeping a lot, and is emotionally overwhelmed. He has a 3-year-old daughter. \n\nThe user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then went to the street, and the user's wife is upset with the user. The user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not enabling him to avoid his house.\n\nHmm. Well, first, grief is really tough. People deal with it in different ways, but Jake is clearly in a bad state. The user's intention was good, to push Jake to face his reality. But maybe they didn't consider how vulnerable Jake was. \n\nAllowing the daughter to stay but not Jake might have left Jake without a place. If Jake went to the streets, that's a serious issue. Even if the user didn't intend that, the outcome was harmful. \n\nAlso, Jake was asking for help. Maybe the user could have found a balance, like letting Jake stay temporarily but setting boundaries. Or maybe they could have offered him support while encouraging him to seek professional help. \n\nThe user's wife is upset because she thinks the user was cruel. The user might not have considered the immediate emotional state of Jake. Even with good intentions, refusing help when someone is in crisis could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut on the other hand, the user might have thought they were doing the right thing for Jake's long-term well-being. However, the result was Jake being homeless, which is a big problem. \n\nSo, maybe the user should have found a different approach. They could have allowed Jake to stay but also suggested he get help, or connected him with community resources. The user's action might have been too abrupt without considering the consequences.\n"
