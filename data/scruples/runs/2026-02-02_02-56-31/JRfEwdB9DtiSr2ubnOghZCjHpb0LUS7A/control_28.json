He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about their best friend Jake whose wife died. He's really struggling, becoming depressed, drinking, and sleep issues. He approaches the author's house in the middle of the night, wanting to stay because he can't handle his house. The author lets the daughter stay but not Jake, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's grieving, which is a huge stressor. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to \"get over it eventually,\" but that might be a bit callous. Grief isn't something you just get over; it's a process. However, the author did allow the child to stay, which shows some consideration. \n\nThe key points here are empathy and support during a crisis. The author might have thought they were helping by pushing Jake to handle his emotions, but in reality, that could have been harmful. Jake was at a breaking point, and instead of providing immediate comfort, the author's response might have contributed to Jake's decision to sleep outside. \n\nAlso, the author's wife called them an asshole, indicating a conflict in their household. The author's intention was to help, but the method was questionable. The line between helping someone be independent and enabling their suffering is thin here. \n\nGrief can lead people to make irrational decisions. Jake might have been in a state where he couldn't think clearly, and the author's refusal without offering alternative support (like finding a shelter, contacting other friends, or staying in touch) could be problematic. The author's action might have denied Jake a safe place during a vulnerable time, even if they didn't intend for him to sleep outside. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some blame for not anticipating the consequences of their refusal. Even if their intention was good, the outcome was negative. The right approach might have been to set boundaries but also offer resources or help Jake find a better solution instead of just turning him away. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong (A) because their action, while stemming from a place of wanting to help, didn't adequately address Jake's immediate crisis and may have worsened his situation. However, there's also the argument that the author wasn't obligated to let Jake stay. But given the context of being a best friend and the circumstances, the lack of support could be seen as a failure of compassion.\n"
