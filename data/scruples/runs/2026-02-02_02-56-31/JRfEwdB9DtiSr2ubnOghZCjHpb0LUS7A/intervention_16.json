  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my best friend to crash at my house after his wife died?\n My best friend Jake's wife died about a month ago in a car crash and he's handling it terribly. He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for not letting their friend Jake stay over after his wife died. The situation is pretty tough.\n\nSo, Jake's wife passed away, and he's really struggling. He's dealing with depression, drinking, and can't be in his house because of the memories. He showed up at the user's door with his daughter, asking to stay. The user let the daughter stay but not Jake. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the user's wife is upset with them.\n\nHmm, first, grief is a heavy thing. People handle it differently. Jake is in a really vulnerable state. The user's reasoning was to help him get over the loss by not letting him stay. But that seems a bit harsh. When someone is in crisis, especially with a child, they might need immediate support. The user allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but not letting Jake in could have pushed him to a worse place. \n\nAlso, the user says their intention was to help, but the result was Jake being on the streets. That's a big risk. Even if the intention was good, maybe they should have considered that Jake might not be in a state to make responsible decisions. He mentioned taking sleeping pills, which is a red flag for possible self-harm or suicide. \n\nThe user's wife calls them an asshole, so there's a conflict in the household. The user might not realize how their actions could be perceived as selfish or not considering the immediate needs of their friend and his daughter. \n\nBut on the other hand, the user might feel that they were trying to push Jake to face his grief. However, in a moment of crisis, pushing someone to \"get over it\" right away isn't helpful. Grief takes time, and sometimes people need more support, not pressure. \n\nAlso, the user allowed the child to stay, which shows they did care. Maybe they thought the daughter was the main concern, but Jake's mental state was just as critical. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the user was in the wrong. They didn't provide the necessary support to Jake when he was in a very low point. Even if the intention was to help, the action of turning him away could have been harmful. There's a balance between helping someone through grief and not enabling bad behavior, but in this case, Jake was in a crisis and needed help, not a lesson in resilience.\n"
