He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife died. So, first, let's break down the situation.\n\nJake's wife died recently. He's clearly struggling, dealing with depression, drinking, and can't be in his house because it reminds him of her. He tried to sleep with pills. Then he shows up at the user's door with his 3-year-old daughter. The user lets the daughter stay but tells Jake he can't. Jake leaves in anger and later sleeps on the streets, leaving his daughter asleep at home.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief. Their wife is upset, calling them an asshole. The user is trying to justify their actions by saying they didn't want to enable Jake's avoidance of his emotions. But is that a valid reason?\n\nHmm, grief is a complex emotion. People cope differently. Jake is in a vulnerable state. The user's action might have been intended to push Jake to face his pain, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate consequences. Sleeping on the streets is dangerous, especially after taking sleeping pills. The user didn't offer an alternative, just refused Jake. Even though they allowed the daughter to stay, Jake's mental state could have been at risk.\n\nAlso, the user's wife is upset, which might indicate that they didn't fully consider the situation. Maybe they could have found another way to help Jake, like staying in touch, getting professional help, or ensuring he had support. Refusing him without other options might have been too harsh given the circumstances. The user's intention is good, but the action might not be the right approach when someone is in crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might feel they have boundaries and can't take full responsibility. But when a friend is in such a vulnerable state, maybe their responsibility is higher. The key is whether the user's refusal directly led to Jake sleeping on the streets. If they knew he was in that state, maybe they should have done more to help, even if it meant setting different boundaries. \n\nI think the user's intention wasn't to harm, but the outcome was that Jake was left in a dangerous situation. So, they might be in the wrong for not considering the consequences of their refusal. They should have found a better way to support Jake without leaving him to fend for himself. The answer is probably A (they are in the wrong).\n"
