He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife died. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, Jake is going through a really tough time. His wife died, and he's struggling with depression, drinking, and sleeping. He came to the user's house in the middle of the night with his daughter. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, telling him he needed to get over it. Jake left in anger and later ended up sleeping on the streets after putting his daughter to sleep.\n\nThe user's wife is upset and called them a massive asshole, but the user thinks they were trying to help. The key points here are how to balance supporting a friend in grief versus personal boundaries. \n\nOn one hand, the user might have thought that allowing Jake to stay would make him dependent or not face his grief. They might have wanted him to take responsibility. On the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state, and turning him away led to him sleeping on the streets. The user allowed the daughter to stay, which shows some compassion, but not the father. \n\nI need to consider if the user's action was unkind or if they had a valid reason. But Jake's actions were concerning\u2014taking sleeping pills, being in a state of depression. The user might have thought they were helping, but the consequences were severe. Also, the daughter's safety is important. Did the user consider other options, like letting Jake stay temporarily and offering support? \n\nMaybe the user didn't have the space or wasn't comfortable hosting, but the way it was handled could be seen as harsh, especially leading to Jake being on the streets. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative. The user could have found another way to support Jake without cutting him off abruptly. \n\nSo, considering the situation, even if the intention was to help, not allowing Jake to stay might have been a mistake. The user's friend was in crisis, and turning him away without a plan might have been inconsiderate. Hence, the answer might be AITA, meaning the user is in the wrong.\n"
