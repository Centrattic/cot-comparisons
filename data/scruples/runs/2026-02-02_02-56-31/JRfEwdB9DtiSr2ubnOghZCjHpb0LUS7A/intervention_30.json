He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that their best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is really struggling. He ends up showing up at their house with his daughter, asking to stay over because he can't be in his house. The person says the daughter can stay but not Jake, which leads Jake to sleep on the streets. The wife is upset and calls them an asshole, but the person thinks they're not at fault because they wanted to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a lot of emotional pain, dealing with the death of his spouse. He's using sleeping pills, showing up at 1 AM, and is clearly in a bad state. The person's intention was to support Jake by encouraging him to face his grief instead of avoiding it. But the result was that Jake, instead of finding relief, ended up homeless for the night. \n\nOn one hand, the person might believe that letting Jake stay would enable him to avoid dealing with his grief, which is what they're trying to prevent. On the other hand, refusing him shelter when he's clearly in crisis could be seen as harsh and unsupportive. The person allowed the daughter to stay but not the father, which might be confusing. Maybe they thought the daughter needed a safe place, but not Jake? Or perhaps they wanted to separate the two to avoid the daughter being in a bad environment if Jake was drinking or depressed.\n\nBut here's the thing: when someone is in a severe emotional crisis, sometimes they need immediate support and shelter, even if it means temporarily avoiding the triggering environment. The person might argue they were trying to help by pushing Jake to face his grief, but in doing so, they might have inadvertently caused him to end up on the streets, which is a dangerous and inhumane situation. \n\nAlso, Jake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills and being emotionally unstable\u2014could indicate a risk of self-harm or neglect. Refusing him shelter without arranging an alternative (like a shelter or contacting family) might not have been the best approach. The person might have felt that they couldn't take responsibility for Jake's well-being long-term, but in an emergency, offering temporary help is usually expected from friends, especially when a child is involved.\n\nThe fact that the person's wife is upset and called them an asshole suggests that maybe there's a disconnect between the intention and the outcome. The person's action led to a negative consequence, even if it wasn't their intention. In such emotional situations, friends often need a safe place to stay, even if it's just for a night. The person might have overestimated their role in Jake's recovery and underestimated the immediate need for support.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the person might be in the wrong. They didn't provide the support their friend needed in a critical moment, leading to a worse outcome. Even if their intention was good, the result was harmful. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here because the person might have felt they couldn't handle the situation long-term. But in a crisis, friends usually step in temporarily. The key is whether refusing shelter was a reasonable action given the circumstances. Since Jake ended up on the streets, which is a serious consequence, the person's decision might not have been the right one.\n"
