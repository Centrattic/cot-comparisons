He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, who lost his wife and is struggling with depression. He ends up knocking on their door in the middle of the night with his 3-year-old daughter. The user says that the daughter can stay but Jake can't. Jake then goes to sleep on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They might think that Jake needs to learn to cope on his own, even if it's hard. They might believe that allowing Jake to stay would enable his behavior of avoiding his home, which is the place associated with his trauma. Their intention was to help him move past his grief, not to hurt him. But the outcome was that Jake ended up on the streets, which is a bad result. The user's wife is upset, calling them an asshole, which adds emotional tension.\n\nThen, Jake's side. He's in a severe emotional state, dealing with the loss of his spouse. He's showing signs of depression, possibly considering suicide with the mention of sleeping pills. His daughter is an important factor here. The user allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but not allowing Jake to stay might have pushed him to a crisis point. Jake's reaction with a glare and leaving without a word shows how hurt he felt. The fact that he went back to his house, put the daughter to sleep, and then went to the streets suggests that he felt rejected and maybe didn't have another place to go. \n\nThe user might not have considered that their refusal could push Jake to a dangerous place. While the intention was to help him become independent, the immediate need for support might have been more critical. Grief can lead to irrational decisions, and Jake might not have the capacity to handle his situation alone at that moment. The user might have failed to provide the necessary support, leading to an unintended negative consequence. \n\nAlso, the user's wife is upset, which might indicate that the user's approach wasn't the most compassionate. The balance between helping someone through grief and pushing them to be independent is tricky. In such a vulnerable state, Jake might need more support rather than being told he has to get over it. The user's action could be seen as not recognizing the severity of Jake's crisis. \n\nHowever, the user did allow the daughter to stay, which shows a willingness to help. They might have thought that they were setting boundaries to prevent enabling long-term dependency. But in this specific instance, the immediate reaction of Jake going to the streets suggests that the refusal had a harmful effect. The user didn't consider alternative solutions, like arranging for another place or calling a crisis hotline or family member. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intention was to help Jake by encouraging independence, the outcome was harmful. They might not have anticipated how their refusal would affect Jake's mental state. The key issue is whether they should have provided more support despite the intention to help him move forward. The answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong because their action led to Jake being in a dangerous situation, even if unintentionally.\n"
