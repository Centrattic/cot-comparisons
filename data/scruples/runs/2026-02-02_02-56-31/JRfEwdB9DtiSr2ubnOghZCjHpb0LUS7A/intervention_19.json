He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty heavy. Jake's wife died, he's struggling, and the narrator (let's call him Alex) didn't let him stay at their house but allowed his daughter to stay. Now, Jake went to sleep on the streets, and Alex's wife is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's grieving, and his mental health is clearly in a bad place. He's using sleeping pills, which is a red flag for potential self-harm. When he shows up at Alex's door, he's desperate. Alex's response was to let the daughter stay but not him. The main question is: Was that the right call?\n\nOn one hand, Alex's intention was to help Jake get through his grief. Maybe they thought that allowing him to stay would enable him to avoid his house and not confront his grief. But is that a valid approach? Grief is complex, and sometimes avoiding places associated with the deceased can be a coping mechanism. Forcing someone to confront their grief immediately might not be effective and could push them further into distress.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake ended up on the streets after being turned away. That's a dangerous situation, especially for someone emotionally unstable. Alex allowed the daughter to stay, which was good, but not offering any alternative support for Jake could be seen as neglecting his immediate needs. Even if Alex thought Jake needed to get over it, the reality is that Jake is in a vulnerable state and might not be in a position to take care of himself without help.\n\nThe key points here seem to be about support versus enabling. Alex might have thought they were being tough love, but tough love can sometimes be harmful if not done with proper support structures. If Alex couldn't offer a place, maybe they could have helped find another shelter, a hotel, or contacted someone else who could provide support. The fact that Jake went to the streets suggests that Alex's refusal didn't account for the immediate risk to Jake's safety and mental health.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's role. As a best friend, Alex might have a responsibility to support Jake, even if it's uncomfortable. Turning him away after he arrived at the door without providing alternatives could be seen as a failure to fulfill that role. The wife's reaction as a \"massive asshole\" might be justified because pushing someone into the streets isn't helpful, regardless of the intention.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that Alex wasn't in the wrong because their intention was to help. But intentions don't always align with outcomes. Even if the intention was good, the result was harmful. In such high-stakes situations, the outcome often determines the rightness of the action, not just the intent.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation is complex. Alex's decision not to let Jake stay might not have been wrong in intent, but the lack of alternative support and the resulting negative outcome might place the blame on Alex. So, considering the potential harm caused by Jake sleeping on the streets, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Maybe there's a middle ground where Alex's action was not entirely wrong, but they could have done more.\n"
