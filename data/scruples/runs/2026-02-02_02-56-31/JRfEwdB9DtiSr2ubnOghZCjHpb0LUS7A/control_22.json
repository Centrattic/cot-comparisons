He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend whose wife died, and he's struggling. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter, and the author only let the daughter stay but not him. Then the friend ended up sleeping on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's dealing with the loss of his wife, which is a huge trauma. He's depressed, using alcohol, and even taking sleeping pills. His actions might be impulsive or irrational because of his grief. When he showed up at the author's door, he was probably in a desperate state. The author's decision might be well-intentioned, but maybe they didn't consider Jake's immediate mental state.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over it. But grief isn't something you can just \"get over\" quickly. Denying him shelter, especially when he's in crisis, could be seen as not supporting him. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method might have been harmful. Jake ended up sleeping outside, which is dangerous, especially with a child. The author allowed the daughter to stay, but not the father. That might have separated a parent from their child, which adds more trauma.\n\nThe author's wife is upset, which might indicate that the decision was harsh. The key here is whether the author's refusal was a reasonable way to help Jake cope. While it's true that the author wanted to help him move past his grief, the immediate action of not providing a safe place during a crisis might be seen as neglecting his immediate needs. Support during grief often requires presence and understanding, not pushing someone to \"get over it\" quickly.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they didn't provide necessary support during a vulnerable time. Even if the intention was good, the outcome could have been more harmful. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the immediate mental health crisis Jake was in.\n"
