He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay after his wife died. So the situation is that Jake is really struggling with grief, and the user refused to let him stay overnight, only allowing his daughter. Then Jake ended up on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The user says their intention was to help Jake get over his wife's death by not enabling him to avoid his house. But Jake's actions after being refused led to him sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous for both him and the child. \n\nOn one hand, the user's friend is in a vulnerable state. The user might be trying to encourage independence, but they didn't offer alternative support. Maybe they should have let Jake stay temporarily, given the immediate crisis. The user's wife is upset because they kicked Jake out, but the user thinks they're helping.\n\nBut, when someone is in a severe emotional crisis and possibly suicidal (he was taking sleeping pills), turning them away without any support might be harmful. Even if the intention is to help, the action might not have been the right approach. The user didn't consider that Jake might not have other options, and by refusing, they might have left him no safe place. \n\nAlso, the daughter's safety is a factor. If Jake can't take care of her properly, maybe the user should have involved other family or authorities instead of just saying no. The user's decision might have been harsh without considering the immediate risks. \n\nSo, while the user's intention was to help, the action could be seen as inconsiderate and potentially dangerous. The balance between supporting someone through grief and allowing them to avoid their environment is tricky. But in a crisis, providing immediate support is crucial. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not handling it more compassionately and not ensuring there was a safety net.\n"
