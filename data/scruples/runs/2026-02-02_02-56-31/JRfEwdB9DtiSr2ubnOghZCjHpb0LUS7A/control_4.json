He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author's best friend Jake lost his wife. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, and turning to drinking. He has a 3-year-old daughter. The author and their wife are trying to help, but when Jake shows up at their door with his daughter at 1 AM, the author only lets the daughter stay but not Jake. Jake then goes back home, puts the kid to sleep, and sleeps on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they did the right thing to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nHmm. The key points here are Jake's mental state, the author's intentions, and the consequences. Jake is in a vulnerable position after a traumatic loss. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over it, so they didn't let him stay. But by sending Jake to the streets, maybe they didn't consider his immediate safety or mental health.\n\nJake was in a crisis, actively trying to cope by taking sleeping pills, and showed up in the middle of the night. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Maybe they thought Jake needed to face his grief alone, but forcing someone in emotional distress to sleep on the streets could be harmful. Even if the intention was good, the action might have been too harsh. There's a difference between encouraging someone to work through their problems and abandoning them when they're in a fragile state.\n\nAlso, the daughter was present. If the author was concerned about Jake's ability to care for the child, maybe there's a responsibility to ensure the child's safety. But the author did let the daughter stay, which is good. However, Jake leaving to sleep outside could put the child at risk if he's not there.\n\nThe author's wife called them an asshole, which suggests that maybe the action was too extreme. The author's intention was to help, but the outcome was Jake being homeless and in a dangerous situation. Mental health issues often require support, not pushing someone away. Even if the author believed Jake needed to \"get over it,\" the approach might be counterproductive. The right approach might have been to set boundaries while still offering support, perhaps contacting someone else to help or ensuring Jake had a safe place temporarily.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have good intentions, the action of not allowing Jake to stay might have been unkind and potentially harmful, especially given Jake's state. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider Jake's immediate needs and safety, even if their intention was to help him heal eventually.\n"
