He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their best friend Jake whose wife died. Jake is struggling, and the author refused to let him stay at their house, leading Jake to sleep on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. Jake is in a lot of grief, which can affect his behavior. He's depressed, drinking, and taking sleeping pills. He shows up at the author's door with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter but not Jake. Then Jake goes back home, puts the kid to sleep, and sleeps outside. The wife is upset with the author, but the author thinks they were helping.\n\nThe key points are: Jake is in a crisis, the author's decision to not let him stay, and the consequence of Jake sleeping on the streets. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel they're helping Jake by not enabling his avoidance of the situation. They might believe Jake needs to face his grief and manage it without escaping. On the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the author's refusal could have left him in a worse position. Sleeping on the streets is dangerous, especially for someone dealing with depression and medication. The author didn't consider alternative solutions, like offering a temporary stay while setting boundaries for the daughter's safety, or helping connect Jake to other support systems.\n\nThe author's intention was to help, but the outcome was harmful. The author might have failed to recognize Jake's immediate needs and the potential risks of his actions. Even if they didn't want to enable avoidance, there's a responsibility to ensure someone isn't left in a dangerous situation. The wife's reaction suggests that the author's approach was unkind and possibly reckless.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author's actions led to Jake being in a worse position. They might not have considered the immediate consequences of their refusal. While their intention was to help in the long run, the method was flawed. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
