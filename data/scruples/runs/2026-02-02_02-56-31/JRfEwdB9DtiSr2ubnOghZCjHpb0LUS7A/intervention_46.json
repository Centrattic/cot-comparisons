He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. So, Jake is really struggling, right? He's dealing with depression, using alcohol, and he's sleep-depred because he's taking pills. Then he shows up at their door with his daughter, and the user only lets the kid stay. The friend gets angry and ends up sleeping on the streets.\n\nHmm, first, the user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get through his grief by not letting him stay, maybe thinking he needs to face it. But is that the right approach? When someone is in deep depression and maybe considering self-harm, being alone could be dangerous. The user's wife called them an asshole, which suggests there's a moral conflict here.\n\nOn one hand, the user didn't directly push Jake out. He left on his own after being denied. But Jake then went to the streets, which is risky, especially with his mental state. Did the user consider other options, like contacting another family member or a support system? Maybe they should have allowed Jake to stay but set boundaries, like no drinking or ensuring he's safe. \n\nAlso, the user's intention wasn't to hurt Jake, but their action had consequences. Even if they thought it was for his own good, not providing support when someone is in crisis might be seen as neglect. The daughter's safety is a point too\u2014keeping the kid but not the dad might have left the child vulnerable if Jake wasn't there. \n\nSo, while the user's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, the method might have been flawed. In such situations, professional help or community support might be more appropriate than cutting off a friend. The user's rigid stance without considering the immediate risks might make them at fault. The answer is probably A (they are in the wrong) because their action, though well-intentioned, didn't account for Jake's mental health needs and the potential dangers of being alone.\n"
