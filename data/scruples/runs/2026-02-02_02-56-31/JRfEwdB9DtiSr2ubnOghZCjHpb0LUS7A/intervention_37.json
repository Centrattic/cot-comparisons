He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend Jake stay overnight after his wife died. So, Jake is dealing with grief, and he and his daughter showed up unannounced at their house in the middle of the night. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then went to sleep on the streets.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context here. Grief can make people act unpredictably. Jake is in a really tough situation, losing his wife, and his mental state is fragile. He's turning to the user for help, which is a natural reaction for a friend. The user's reasoning was to help Jake move past his grief by not letting him avoid his home. But Jake sleeping on the streets is a dangerous situation. \n\nThe user's action of allowing the daughter but not him might have been intended to push him to face reality, but was it the right way? The friend was in a crisis, and as a friend, maybe the user should have considered alternative solutions instead of a firm refusal. Maybe a compromise, like letting him stay for a while but encouraging him to take steps forward. Also, the user's wife was upset, so there might be valid concerns about their own household and well-being. \n\nBut Jake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills and then sleeping on the street\u2014pose a risk of self-harm or harm to the child. The user might not have realized the immediate danger. The key points here are the user's intention to help Jake overcome his grief versus the unintended consequence of putting him in a dangerous situation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the intention was good, refusing to support a grieving friend in a critical moment might be seen as a failure to be there when needed. The user could have offered help in another way, like contacting other friends or professionals. So, considering all that, maybe the user is in the wrong for not finding a better solution, even if their intention was to help.\n"
