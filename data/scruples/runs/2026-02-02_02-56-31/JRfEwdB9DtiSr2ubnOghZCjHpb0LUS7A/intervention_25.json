He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their friend Jake stay over after his wife died. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, Jake's wife died a month ago. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, maybe substance abuse. He has a 3-year-old daughter. The user let the daughter stay but not Jake because they thought he needed to \"get over it.\" Then Jake ended up on the street, and the user's wife is upset with them.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake move past his grief. But maybe they didn't consider his mental state. Jake was at a breaking point, and instead of providing support, they sent him away. Even though they meant to help, their approach might have been harmful. \n\nJake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, being too depressed to handle his house\u2014suggest he's in a crisis. The user's decision not to let him stay could have pushed him to a point where he couldn't cope, leading to him sleeping outside. The daughter's safety is also a concern if Jake was too out of it to care for her properly.\n\nThe user's wife thinks they're an asshole, which adds another layer. Maybe the user didn't fully grasp the severity of Jake's situation. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative. There's a responsibility to support a friend in such a vulnerable time. Refusing shelter without offering alternatives might be seen as abandonment.\n\nSo, was the user in the wrong? They didn't let Jake stay, but they did allow the daughter. However, the consequence was Jake ending up on the streets. The user might not have considered all the factors, like Jake's mental health and immediate needs. It's possible they were trying to be firm, but maybe they should have offered more support or help getting him professional assistance instead of just refusing.\n\nIn the end, while the user's intention was to help, their action might have done more harm. So the answer might be A, they are in the wrong for not providing necessary support during a crisis.\n"
