He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who asked the question (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about allowing their best friend, Jake, to stay at their house after his wife's death.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. Jake's wife died recently, and he's struggling with depression, drinking, and sleep issues. He came to the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter because he couldn't be in his house. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake went back, put the daughter to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not at fault because they wanted to help Jake get through his grief.\n\nNow, considering the options A and B. The key points here are empathy, responsibility, and the immediate consequences. Jake is in a mental health crisis, and the author's response might be seen as not supportive enough. Allowing the daughter but not the father could lead to unsafe situations. The author's intention was to help him move past his grief, but their action might have pushed him away instead. \n\nJake's actions after being rejected (sleeping on the streets) are dangerous, and the author's decision might have contributed to that. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. The author's wife called them a \"massive asshole,\" which adds to the conflict. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, when someone is in a vulnerable state, friends might have a duty to ensure their safety. The author could have found a better solution, like offering a temporary stay but setting boundaries for Jake's well-being. Alternatively, they could have involved other resources or support systems. \n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, the action of turning Jake away without a plan for his safety and mental health might be considered wrong. The immediate consequence was that Jake ended up on the streets, which is a severe outcome. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
