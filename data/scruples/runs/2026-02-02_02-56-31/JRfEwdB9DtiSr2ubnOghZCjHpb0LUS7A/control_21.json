He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. So, Jake is dealing with severe grief and depression. He turned up at their house in the middle of the night with his daughter. The author said the daughter could stay but not Jake.\n\nHmm, on one hand, the author might have wanted to help Jake move past his grief. Maybe they thought he needed to face his emotions instead of avoiding his house. But Jake was in a really bad state\u2014using pills and not handling things well. Leaving him on the streets sounds dangerous. The author's wife is upset, calling them an asshole, but the author thinks they were trying to help.\n\nWait, but Jake's well-being is a priority here. Even if the intention was good, not providing a safe place for him after he was in such a vulnerable state could be harmful. There's a line between helping someone overcome grief and not allowing them to seek temporary comfort. The author might have been trying to push Jake, but maybe they should have considered the immediate safety. Also, the daughter was with him, so the situation was more complex. \n\nI think the author's reasoning might be flawed. While the intention was to help, the action of not letting Jake stay could have led to a dangerous outcome. Jake was already in a bad mental state, and sending him out to sleep on the streets after he asked for help isn't responsible. The author should have found an alternative, like staying up to talk or ensuring he had a safe place. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't fully consider the immediate consequences to Jake's safety and well-being, even if their intention was good.\n"
