He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The friend, Jake, was in a bad state, came to their house late at night with his daughter, and the user only allowed the daughter to stay. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets. The wife called the user an asshole, but they think they're not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Grief is a major factor here. Jake is dealing with the death of his spouse, which is a traumatic event. He's showing signs of depression and possibly a risk to himself, given the mention of sleeping pills. The user's response was to deny Jake shelter but allow the daughter. Their reasoning was to help him get through his grief, but the outcome was negative.\n\nOn one hand, the user might have thought that allowing Jake to stay would prevent him from dealing with his emotions, but by not providing support, he ended up on the streets. That could be seen as a failure to support a friend in need. On the other hand, the user might feel they were encouraging independence, but the situation required immediate emotional support and safety.\n\nThe key points here are the safety of Jake and his daughter. If Jake was a danger to himself or others, the user should have ensured he got help. Instead of sending him away, maybe contacting a professional or a support group would have been better. The user might not have realized the severity of Jake's mental state. However, in hindsight, not providing a safe place when he was clearly in crisis might make them responsible, at least partially, for the outcome.\n\nThe user's wife is upset, and the action of sending Jake away without ensuring his well-being could be seen as inconsiderate. Friends in crisis need support, not rejection. Even if the intention was to help him move on, the method was flawed. So, the user's actions led to Jake sleeping on the streets, which is a negative consequence. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because they didn't take adequate steps to ensure Jake's safety after denying him shelter.\n"
