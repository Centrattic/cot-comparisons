He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay after his wife's death. The friend, Jake, is clearly in a bad state\u2014depressed, drinking, taking sleeping pills. He came to their house with his daughter at 1 AM, and the user allowed the daughter to stay but not him. The friend then went to sleep on the streets, and the user's wife is upset with them.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to help Jake get through his grief, but their action might have been harsh. Allowing the daughter but not Jake could be seen as cold. Jake's actions show he's struggling, maybe even suicidal thoughts with the sleeping pills. The user didn't consider that Jake might not be in a state to be alone. Even if the intention was good, the execution might have been lacking. The user could have offered a compromise, like staying for a short time, or connecting him with professional help. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets instead of getting help might indicate the user's approach had unintended consequences. So, maybe the user is in the wrong because they didn't provide the necessary support despite the intention to help. But some might argue that they were trying to encourage independence. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is A, they are in the wrong because they should have been more compassionate and found a better solution than just refusing.\n"
