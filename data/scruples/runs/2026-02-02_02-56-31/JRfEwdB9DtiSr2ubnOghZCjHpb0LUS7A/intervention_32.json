He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. So, Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and he showed up at their house with his daughter. The user said the daughter can stay but Jake can't. Then Jake slept on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The user's intention was to help Jake get through the grief, but their action might have pushed him away. On one hand, the user might be thinking that Jake needs to face his emotions and not avoid his house. But Jake was in a fragile state, and being alone after such a loss could be dangerous, especially with him taking sleeping pills and showing signs of depression. \n\nThe user's wife called them an asshole, which suggests there's a conflict in the household about how to handle the situation. The user might believe they're helping by not enabling Jake's avoidance, but Jake ended up worse. Maybe the user should have found another solution, like letting Jake stay but with conditions, or getting professional help. \n\nAlso, Jake had his daughter with him, so leaving her alone isn't ideal. The user allowed the daughter to stay but sent Jake away, which might have caused Jake to feel abandoned. The user's approach might have been too rigid. In cases of severe grief and possible depression, the priority is safety. If Jake was a danger to himself, the user might have a responsibility to ensure he gets help, rather than just telling him to get over it.\n\nBut the user might not have considered Jake's immediate mental state. They thought they were helping, but their method didn't account for Jake's possible crisis. So, maybe they are in the wrong for not offering support in a more compassionate way. The answer could hinge on whether the user's actions contributed to Jake's decision to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intention was to help, their method could be seen as lacking empathy and practical support, leading to negative consequences. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
