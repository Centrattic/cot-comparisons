He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died.\n\nFirst, the context: Jake's wife died, he's struggling, and he showed up at the author's house with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which made the author's wife upset. The author thinks they were right because their intention was to help Jake get over his grief.\n\nI need to consider the situation from different angles. Grief is a heavy burden, and Jake is in a vulnerable state. Allowing him to stay might have provided immediate comfort and safety. However, the author's reasoning was to push Jake to cope, maybe thinking that avoiding the environment might not be helpful long-term.\n\nBut when someone is in crisis, especially after a traumatic event like losing a spouse, their immediate needs might be more about emotional support and safety. Even if the author's intention was good, turning Jake away could have led to a dangerous situation, like him sleeping on the streets. The fact that Jake was already contemplating sleeping pills adds to the concern about his mental state.\n\nThe author did allow the daughter to stay, which was probably a good decision. However, excluding Jake himself might have been a mistake. Best friends often have a responsibility to support each other in times of need. The author's wife called them a \"massive asshole,\" indicating that the decision wasn't well-received, possibly because it put Jake in a risky situation.\n\nAnother angle: The author might be overestimating their ability to help Jake by pushing him to stay in his house. Grief responses vary, and some people might need distance from the environment associated with the loss. Forcing someone to stay there when they're not ready could exacerbate their pain.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did offer to let the daughter stay, which shows some level of support. But the key issue here is Jake's mental health. By not letting him stay, the author might have indirectly contributed to his decision to sleep outside, which is dangerous and could lead to more harm.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the intention was to help, the outcome was negative. The author might have failed to consider the immediate safety and mental health of their friend. There's a balance between encouraging someone to cope and ensuring their well-being in the moment.\n\nI think the author's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, didn't take into account the severity of Jake's current state. Allowing both Jake and his daughter to stay might have been the more compassionate choice. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets suggests that the author's decision had unintended consequences, which could make them partially at fault.\n"
