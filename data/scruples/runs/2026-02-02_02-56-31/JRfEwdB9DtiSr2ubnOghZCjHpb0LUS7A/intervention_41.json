He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing their friend Jake to stay overnight. The situation is that Jake's wife died, he's struggling, and he showed up unannounced with his 3-year-old daughter. The user let the kid stay but not Jake. Now Jake took that to mean he could sleep on the streets, and the user's wife is upset with him.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his home. But they had to draw a line. Letting the child stay shows they weren't entirely kicking them out. But Jake's response was to go sleep outside, which seems like a bad outcome. The user's wife is upset, which adds to the tension.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, maybe. They didn't kick Jake out directly, but their refusal might have pushed him to a desperate action. Grief is complex, and someone in that state might not act rationally. The user's intention was good, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate needs of someone in crisis. Also, not allowing an adult to stay with his child at night might be seen as neglecting his responsibility to care for the child, even if they didn't know about the sleeping pills. The user's approach might have come off as harsh, especially given the emotional state of Jake. It's a tough balance between helping someone heal and setting boundaries. The answer might hinge on whether the user's actions were seen as supportive enough during a very difficult time.\n"
