He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay at their house after his wife died. Jake was in a bad state, and even though the user allowed his daughter to stay, they refused Jake. The user's wife is upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Jake is clearly grieving, and his actions, like taking sleeping pills and sleeping on the streets, are concerning. The user's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, but their method was to refuse him shelter. However, refusing shelter might not be the best way to support someone in such a vulnerable state. \n\nThe user allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but kicking Jake out could have led to dangerous consequences, like what happened when he slept on the streets. The user might not have considered the immediate emotional and physical needs of Jake. Even if the intention was good, the outcome could have been more harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, the user isn't responsible for solving all of Jake's problems, but as a friend, there's a balance between helping and pushing someone to handle their grief. The user might have failed to provide necessary support during a critical time. The wife's reaction as a \"massive asshole\" suggests that others might see the user's actions as harsh. \n\nSo, the user probably is in the wrong because their refusal without considering the potential consequences wasn't supportive. They could have offered a different solution, like a time-limited stay or connecting Jake with professional help. The answer is A.\n"
