He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting his best friend Jake stay at his house after Jake's wife died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake's wife died in a car crash, and he's really struggling with grief. He's drinking, sleeping a lot, and not handling it well. He shows up at the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay because he can't be in his own house. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. That night, Jake goes to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset. The author defends his decision by saying he wanted to help Jake get over his grief, not push him into that situation.\n\nSo, the key points are: Jake's mental state, the presence of a young child, the author's refusal, and the consequence of Jake sleeping outside.\n\nI need to consider the ethical implications here. On one hand, the author might be trying to encourage independence, not enabling dependency. But on the other hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author's refusal might have pushed him into a dangerous situation. Also, Jake's daughter is there; the author allowed her to stay but not her father. Maybe the author was considering the child's safety but still could have offered support to Jake.\n\nGrief can make people act irrationally. The author might not have realized how desperate Jake was. By refusing, even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. The author's wife thinks he's an asshole, which suggests there's a conflict in perspectives. The author might not have considered all the consequences of his refusal. Also, Jake had mentioned taking sleeping pills, which could be a suicide risk, but the author didn't offer help there either. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, as a friend, the author might have an obligation to ensure Jake's safety, even if it's not a legal duty. The author could have said, \"I can't have you stay, but let me help you find a safe place or call someone.\" Refusing without providing alternatives might be seen as neglecting his friend's well-being. \n\nHowever, the author is also a private individual with a family. He might not have the resources or willingness to host someone long-term. But in an emergency situation, there might be a moral obligation to step in, especially when someone is at risk of self-harm. \n\nThe author's intention matters, but the result is that Jake ended up on the streets, which is bad. So even if the intention was to help, the action might have been harmful. The question is whether refusing to let him stay was the right call, considering the circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author had good intentions, refusing without offering other support options could be seen as being in the wrong. Friends aren't obligated to provide shelter in such situations, but when someone is in crisis, there's an expectation to provide some level of support. The author's response might have been too rigid and not empathetic enough given the severity of Jake's situation.\n"
