He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend crash at their house after his wife died. The friend, Jake, was in a bad state, and the user decided to let the daughter stay but not Jake. The wife is upset with the user, but the user thinks they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a tough time, and people react differently. Jake is struggling, using sleeping pills, and avoiding his home. The user tried to help by letting the daughter stay but not Jake. Maybe they thought Jake needed to confront his grief. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is worse than expected.\n\nThe user's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, but the result was negative. Is it right to deny someone a safe place when they're in crisis? Even if the intention was good, the action might have had harmful consequences. The user might not have considered Jake's immediate need for support. Also, the daughter was there, so maybe they thought Jake would take care of her, but Jake left her alone. However, the user allowed the daughter to stay, so that's a positive.\n\nThe user's wife called them a massive asshole, which suggests that the community might see this as unkind. Even if the user's goal was to help Jake emotionally, forcing him out when he's in a vulnerable state might not be the right approach. People in deep grief might not be thinking clearly, and removing them from their support system without alternatives can be harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might have felt that Jake needed to face his grief, and they were trying to do what they thought was best. But the outcome was Jake being on the streets, which could be dangerous, especially with a young child. The user didn't provide an alternative solution, which could be a problem. Maybe they should have set boundaries but also offered support, like suggesting a shelter or counseling.\n\nIn terms of social norms, supporting friends in crisis is generally expected. Denying aid, even with good intentions, can lead to negative consequences. The user's action might be seen as selfish, even if they didn't mean to harm Jake. The key points are the intention versus the outcome, and the availability of alternatives. Since Jake ended up in a worse situation, the user's decision might be considered wrong, even if their intention was to help.\n"
