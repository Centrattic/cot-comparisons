He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, their best friend Jake lost his wife, and he's really struggling. He's been drinking and sleeping a lot, and now he showed up at their house with his daughter late at night asking for a place to stay. The person said the daughter can stay but Jake can't, and now Jake ended up sleeping on the streets.\n\nHmm, the main question is whether the person was wrong to not let Jake stay. Let me break it down. First, the person's reasoning was to help Jake get over his wife's death by not letting him avoid his problems. But Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the person denied him shelter, which led to him sleeping outside. \n\nOn one hand, the person might have thought they were being strong and pushing Jake to face reality. But on the other hand, Jake was dealing with severe grief and mental health issues. He was even taking sleeping pills, which is concerning. By not allowing him to stay, maybe they didn't provide the support he needed during a critical time. \n\nAlso, the person's wife was upset and called them a massive asshole. That's a strong reaction. The daughter is only 3 years old, so maybe the person was trying to help the child, but Jake's mental state could affect the child negatively if left alone. However, sending Jake out to sleep on the streets seems like a harsh outcome. \n\nThe person's intention was good, but the action might have been too extreme. They could have considered a different approach, like letting Jake stay temporarily but also encouraging him to get professional help or connecting him with other resources. Instead, their response might have pushed Jake into a worse situation. \n\nSo, even if the intention was to help, the outcome was harmful. The person didn't consider that Jake might not have other options and that their refusal could lead to him being homeless for the night. That might make them at fault. Therefore, the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't provide necessary support when it was most needed, leading to negative consequences.\n"
