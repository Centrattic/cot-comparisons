He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight after his wife died. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died in a car crash a month ago. He's really struggling, becoming depressed, drinking, sleeping a lot. He's not neglecting their daughter, but he's barely holding on. The user is his best friend, trying to help. \n\nThen, Jake came to their house in the middle of the night with his daughter. He asked to stay because he can't handle his house anymore. The user said the daughter could stay but not Jake, telling him he needs to get over it. Jake left angrily, and later went to sleep on the streets. The wife is upset, but the user thinks they were trying to help.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user was in the wrong. Let's think about both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the user is trying to encourage Jake to be strong and move past his grief. They might believe that not letting him avoid his house is helping him cope. But on the other hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state, possibly suicidal (he mentioned taking sleeping pills). By not letting him stay, the user might have left him without support, leading him to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. The user didn't consider that Jake might need more help, not just being told to toughen up. Also, the daughter is there, and the user let the daughter stay but not Jake, which might be confusing or hurtful. \n\nJake's actions suggest he's in a crisis. Even if the user's intention was to help, the outcome was negative. Maybe a better approach would be to get him professional help, ensure his daughter's safety, and offer support without being dismissive. The user's wife is upset because they see it as being harsh. The user might not realize the severity of Jake's mental state. \n\nIn terms of morality, empathy is important here. While the user had good intentions, the action might have been too harsh without considering Jake's immediate needs. Also, pushing someone to \"get over it\" during such a traumatic time can be harmful. The user should have maybe set boundaries but also provided support, like contacting a counselor, a support group, or other family. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, it seems like the user did make a mistake. They didn't provide the necessary support and instead created a situation that led Jake to be homeless for the night. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
