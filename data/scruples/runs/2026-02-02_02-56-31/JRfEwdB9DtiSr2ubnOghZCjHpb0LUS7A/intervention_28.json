He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing their best friend Jake to stay at their house. The situation is that Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and he showed up at their door with his daughter. The user let the daughter stay but not Jake, leading Jake to end up sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, so they thought setting a boundary by not letting Jake stay would push him to get better. But Jake ended up in a worse situation\u2014sleeping outside with a 3-year-old. The user's wife is upset, calling them a massive asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the user was trying to be a good friend by encouraging independence. Grief is hard, and sometimes people need space or professional help. But on the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the user's decision might have led to a dangerous situation for both Jake and his daughter. Allowing Jake to stay temporarily could have provided immediate support. \n\nThe user's action might have been well-intentioned, but the outcome was harmful. It's possible they didn't consider all the consequences. The fact that Jake took sleeping pills and is in a bad mental state means he might not be making rational decisions. By not letting him stay, the user might have failed to provide necessary support during a crisis.\n\nAlso, the user allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but Jake needed emotional support too. The user's approach could be seen as harsh, given the circumstances. Friends in crisis need compassion and practical help, not just advice. So, even if the user's intention was to help, the method might have been inappropriate. \n\nIn summary, while the user's intention wasn't to harm Jake, their action might have neglected the immediate needs and safety of both Jake and his daughter. Therefore, the user could be considered in the wrong for not being supportive enough in a compassionate way.\n"
