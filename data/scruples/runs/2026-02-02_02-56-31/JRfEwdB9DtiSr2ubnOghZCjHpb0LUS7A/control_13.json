He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife in a car crash. Jake is really struggling, dealing with depression, and sometimes drinks or sleeps a lot. He's not neglecting his 3-year-old daughter, but he's barely holding on. \n\nA few days ago, Jake said he couldn't take being in his house because it reminds him of his wife and he was taking sleeping pills. Then one night at 1 AM, he shows up at the author's door with his daughter, asking to stay. The author says the daughter can stay, but Jake can't, reasoning that he needs to get over it. Jake gets really angry and leaves. Later, it turns out Jake went back home, put his daughter to sleep, and then slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, calling him an asshole, but the author thinks he's not in the wrong because his intention was to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the factors. The author is a friend who offered a place for the daughter but not Jake. The reasoning was to help Jake face his grief. But Jake ended up on the streets, which is a bad outcome. \n\nFirst, the author might be thinking that allowing Jake to stay would prevent him from dealing with the triggers of his wife's memory. But in reality, Jake is in a severe emotional state, using sleeping pills, and showing signs of possible self-harm. The author's decision might be based on good intentions, but it's possible that Jake's situation is more critical than just needing to face his grief. \n\nJake's actions of putting the daughter to sleep and then going to the streets could indicate that he's at risk of something more serious, maybe even self-harm. The author might have a responsibility to ensure that Jake and the child are safe. By not allowing Jake to stay, even if it's to help him process, the author might have failed to support a friend in a crisis. \n\nAlso, the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. That could leave the child without proper supervision if Jake isn't there. The author might have assumed Jake would be there, but he left. So the author's action might have inadvertently put the child at risk. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to push Jake to cope. However, when someone is in a severe mental health crisis, sometimes the immediate need is for support, not confrontation. The author's approach might be counterproductive if it leads to Jake isolating himself further and potentially harming himself. \n\nThe key points here are the severity of Jake's emotional state, the immediate safety of both Jake and his daughter, and the friend's responsibility in a crisis. The author's actions, while perhaps well-meaning, might not consider the immediate dangers Jake is facing. The author might have a duty to help in a more supportive way rather than pushing him to confront his grief alone. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because the situation required immediate support and intervention rather than a strategy that could lead to harmful outcomes. The author's decision not to let Jake stay, despite his critical condition, might have contributed to the negative consequences.\n"
