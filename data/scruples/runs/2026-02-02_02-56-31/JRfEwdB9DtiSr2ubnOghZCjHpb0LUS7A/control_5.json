He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves the author refusing to let their friend Jake stay over after Jake's wife died. Jake is struggling, has a 3-year-old daughter, and shows signs of depression, even taking sleeping pills. He shows up unannounced at the author's house, asking for a place to stay. The author allows the daughter but not Jake, leading Jake to sleep on the streets. The wife is upset with the author.\n\nFirst, consider the context: Jake is in a crisis, dealing with grief and possible mental health issues. The author's intention was to help him move past the grief, but their action of refusing Jake while letting the daughter stay might have caused harm. The key points here are Jake's mental state, the immediate danger he might be in (sleeping pills, not taking care of his daughter properly), and the author's decision not to offer full support.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jake needs to \"get over it,\" but in reality, someone in deep grief might need temporary support, not rejection. By not allowing Jake to stay, the author might have inadvertently pushed him into a more harmful situation. Even though the author didn't intend for Jake to sleep on the streets, the outcome was that he did, which could be seen as a failure to provide necessary support during a vulnerable time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have had the capacity to host both Jake and the child, but there might be other ways to help, like offering a room temporarily or connecting him with community resources. The author's decision could be seen as lacking empathy and not fully understanding Jake's desperate state. The wife's reaction suggests that the action was harsh, which adds to the consideration that the author might be in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, when a friend is in such a crisis, offering support is expected unless there are extenuating circumstances (like safety concerns). The author's refusal without adequate alternative support could be viewed as neglecting a responsibility to help a friend in need. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
