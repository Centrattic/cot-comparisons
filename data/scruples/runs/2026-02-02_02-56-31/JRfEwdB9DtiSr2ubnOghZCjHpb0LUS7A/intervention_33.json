He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the narrator was right to not let their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife died. Jake's wife passed away in a car crash, and he's really struggling. He's been drinking, sleeping a lot, and is generally a mess. They have a 3-year-old daughter, and Jake isn't neglecting her but is barely holding on.\n\nThe key event is when Jake shows up at the narrator's house with his daughter in the middle of the night. The narrator allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. Jake then goes back to his house, puts the kid to sleep, and ends up on the streets. The wife is upset with the narrator, but the person is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, empathy is important here. Jake is in a lot of pain, dealing with grief. His actions are probably a result of that grief. The narrator's intention was to help by pushing Jake to handle things on his own, but maybe that wasn't the right approach. Allowing Jake and his daughter to stay might have provided immediate support, especially since they're best friends. \n\nBut there's also a consideration of boundaries. The narrator isn't obligated to let someone stay indefinitely, especially if there are concerns about safety or the situation becoming a long-term problem. However, Jake wasn't asking for a long stay\u2014just a night. The narrator might have been trying to encourage independence, but in a time of crisis, emotional support is crucial.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's well-being. Jake was bringing his daughter, so the narrator's refusal could put her in a tough spot. Even if the narrator allowed the daughter to stay, separating her from her father might cause more distress. Maybe the narrator could have offered a compromise, like letting both stay for the night but setting a time limit.\n\nThe outcome was Jake ending up on the streets, which seems harsh. The narrator's intention wasn't to cause that, but the result is still harmful. In moments of crisis, people might act impulsively, and the best friends should support each other. The narrator's response might have been too rigid, not considering Jake's fragile mental state.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The narrator wasn't cruel for setting boundaries, but maybe didn't offer enough support. Since Jake was in a vulnerable state, the best friend might have needed a different approach\u2014like allowing him to stay temporarily while also encouraging professional help or other resources.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the narrator was in the wrong) because refusing support could have led to harmful consequences, even if the intention was good. However, it's not entirely clear-cut. But based on the options given, the answer is A.\n"
