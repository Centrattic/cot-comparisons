He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is at fault for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. Hmm.\n\nSo, the friend Jake is dealing with depression, using sleeping pills, and showing up unannounced with his daughter. The author said the kid can stay but not Jake. Then Jake ends up on the streets. The wife is upset, but the author thinks they did the right thing to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions were wrong. On one hand, the author might be trying to encourage independence. But on the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state. Was it necessary to deny him shelter? Maybe there's a balance between helping and being supportive. The author allowed the child but not the father. That's a bit confusing. If the kid is staying, why not let the dad stay to take care of the child? Maybe the author thought Jake needed to be alone, but leaving him on the streets seems like a bad outcome. The author might not have considered alternatives, like checking in later or involving others. So, maybe the author is partly wrong because they didn't think of other ways to help. But the intention was good. It's a tricky situation. I think the answer is A (wrong) because not allowing Jake to stay when he was in crisis, leading to him sleeping on the streets, could be seen as not providing necessary support during a time of need. Even if the intention was to help him move past his grief, the immediate action might have been unkind and lacked alternatives.\n"
