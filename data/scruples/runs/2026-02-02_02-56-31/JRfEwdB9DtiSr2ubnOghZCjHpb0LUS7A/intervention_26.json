He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by not letting their best friend stay at their house after his wife died. The situation is that Jake is really struggling, and the user turned him away, allowing his daughter to stay but not him.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his grief. But is forcing someone to sleep on the streets a constructive way to help them cope? That seems counterproductive. Jake was in a vulnerable state, possibly suicidal with the mention of sleeping pills. The user's action might have led to him sleeping outside, which is dangerous, especially with a 3-year-old daughter. \n\nThe user's wife is upset, calling the user a massive asshole, which is a strong reaction. But the user's intention was to help. However, intentions don't always justify actions when the outcome is harmful. Jake's mental health was at risk, and the user's refusal might have contributed to a worse outcome. The user could have set boundaries but also offered some support, like a time limit or conditions. \n\nAlso, considering Jake's daughter, allowing her to stay but not her father could be traumatic for her. The user might have thought about alternative solutions, like contacting other friends or family, or even a local shelter. The key here is whether the user's actions were the most compassionate and helpful in a crisis. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the user might have had good intentions, the result was potentially harmful. The user could have handled it differently, showing empathy while setting boundaries. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because the action didn't consider the immediate needs and safety of both Jake and his daughter.\n"
