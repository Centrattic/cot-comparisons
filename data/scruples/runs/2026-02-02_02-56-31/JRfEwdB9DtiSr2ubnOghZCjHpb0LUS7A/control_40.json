He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The situation is pretty heavy. The friend, Jake, is really struggling with depression and grief. He showed up unannounced with his daughter, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. The friend then left and slept on the streets, which the author's wife is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author said their intention was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him stay. But Jake was in a vulnerable state, using sleeping pills, and had mental health issues. The author's approach might have been well-meaning but perhaps not the best way to handle it. \n\nIn situations of severe grief, people might not make rational decisions. By not allowing Jake to stay, the author might have pushed him into a worse situation. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. The author could have offered support in a different way, like allowing both Jake and his daughter to stay temporarily and maybe suggesting professional help instead of denying him shelter.\n\nAlso, the friend's daughter was with him. The author allowed the daughter but not the father. That might not be safe, especially if Jake is struggling with mental health and substance use. The author might have put the child at risk by separating the parent from the child. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's own home and family's well-being need to be considered. They might have limits on how much they can help. However, in a crisis, especially where someone is at risk of self-harm or harming their child, the immediate need for safety is paramount. \n\nThe key point is that Jake's actions indicated a severe mental health crisis. The author's response might have been rigid and not empathetic enough. Even if they meant to push Jake to get better, forcing him out when he was in such a state could be seen as neglecting his immediate needs. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps intending to help in the long run, may have caused harm in the short term. The answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't provide necessary support during a critical time, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets, which could be dangerous.\n"
