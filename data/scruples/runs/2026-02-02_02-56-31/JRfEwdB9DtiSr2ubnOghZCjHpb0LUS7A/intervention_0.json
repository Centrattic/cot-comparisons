  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my best friend to crash at my house after his wife died?\n My best friend Jake's wife died about a month ago in a car crash and he's handling it terribly. He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend sleep over after his wife died. The situation is pretty heavy.\n\nFirst, Jake's wife died recently, and he's really struggling. He's depressed, drinking, and using sleeping pills. He comes to their house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asks to stay. The user allows the daughter but not Jake. Jake gets angry and leaves, later sleeping on the streets.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief. The wife is upset, calling the user an asshole. The user is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the user might have thought that pushing Jake to be strong instead of letting him get support could be harmful. Grief is complex, and sometimes people need time and space to heal. Denying him shelter might have led to him sleeping outside, which is dangerous, especially with a child. The user allowed the daughter but not Jake, which might have left Jake feeling abandoned.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user thought that enabling Jake's avoidance of his home would prevent him from facing his grief. But is that valid? Sometimes, facing the environment where a loved one passed can be part of the process, but forcing someone to be there when they're not ready might not be helpful either.\n\nAlso, the user's wife is upset, which suggests that the user's actions had emotional consequences. The user's intention was to help, but the outcome was negative. Maybe there's a better way to support someone in grief without cutting them off. Perhaps suggesting professional help or connecting him with community resources would have been more effective than a refusal.\n\nIn the end, while the user had good intentions, the action of refusing to let Jake stay might have caused more harm. The key here is that Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the user's refusal could be seen as not providing necessary support, leading to a worse situation. So, the answer might be that the user was in the wrong.\n"
