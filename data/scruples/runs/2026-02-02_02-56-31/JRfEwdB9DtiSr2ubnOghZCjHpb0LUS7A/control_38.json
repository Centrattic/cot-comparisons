He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, Jake's wife died recently, and he's clearly struggling. He's depressed, using drugs, and can't handle being in his house. Then he shows up at the author's house with his 3-year-old daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. The result is that Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is bad, but the author's reasoning was to push Jake to deal with his grief.\n\nHmm. So the question is about whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author tried to be supportive by letting the child stay, which is responsible. But refusing Jake might have been a mistake. Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author's refusal could have led to a dangerous situation (sleeping on the streets). Even if the intention was good, maybe the outcome was harmful. The wife called the author an asshole, and maybe she's right. But the author's intention was to help him move past his grief, but maybe they should have considered the immediate safety and well-being of Jake and his daughter. \n\nAlso, Jake's mental health is a factor. He's in a state where he's taking sleeping pills, indicating possible self-harm. The author might not have realized that refusing him could push him to a breaking point. It's a balance between encouraging independence and providing necessary support during a crisis. \n\nIn such cases, maybe the right approach is to offer temporary support while also encouraging professional help. The author could have allowed Jake to stay but also reached out to other friends or a counselor. Refusing him entirely might have been too harsh, especially when he was in such a fragile state. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the immediate dangers and the emotional state of their friend. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
