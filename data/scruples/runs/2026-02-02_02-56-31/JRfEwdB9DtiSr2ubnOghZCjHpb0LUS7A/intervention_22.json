He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is really struggling. He came to their house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. They let the daughter stay but not Jake, and now Jake is on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's grieving, which is a really tough time. He might be in a place where he can't see clearly, making impulsive decisions. The person's reasoning was to push Jake to cope and get over it, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate risk to him and his daughter. \n\nThen, the person let Jake's daughter stay, which is good, but sent Jake away. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous. The person might not have thought through the consequences of their decision. Even if their intention was to help, the result was harmful. \n\nAlso, the person mentioned that Jake was drinking and on sleeping pills. Sending him out alone at night could be risky. They might not have considered that Jake might not have the mental capacity to handle the situation alone. The wife called the person an asshole, which adds to the idea that their actions were harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the person might feel they were trying to encourage Jake to become independent again. But in a crisis, people need support, not being pushed away. Maybe they should have offered a safe space for both Jake and his daughter, or connected him with professional help instead of cutting him off. \n\nSo, considering all this, even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative and potentially dangerous. The person might be in the wrong because they didn't take into account the immediate needs and safety of their friend and his child. They should have handled it with more compassion and perhaps sought another solution.\n"
