He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that Jake's wife died, and he's really struggling. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter, and the author let the daughter stay but not him. Then Jake went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but they think they're right because they wanted to help Jake get through his grief.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider Jake's mental state. He's in a lot of pain, and he's using drugs or alcohol to cope. He's not handling it well, but he's still trying to care for his daughter. When he showed up at the author's house, he was looking for comfort. The author's reasoning was that Jake needed to eventually get over it, so they didn't let him stay. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous, especially with a young child. \n\nThe author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. That might be a problem because Jake might need support too. If Jake is in a fragile state, turning him away could push him to make bad decisions. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by pushing Jake to face his grief, but maybe they didn't consider his immediate safety or the fact that he's a parent who needs to be there for his daughter. \n\nAlso, Jake's wife called the author an asshole, indicating that the author's actions had negative consequences. The author's intention was good, but the outcome was bad. There's a balance between helping someone through grief and not enabling harmful behavior. However, Jake was already in a crisis point. By not allowing Jake to stay, maybe the author didn't provide necessary support. \n\nAnother angle: the author's wife was upset, and the author's decision might not have considered the emotional impact on Jake. Even if the author thought they were helping, the result was Jake sleeping on the streets, which could lead to further mental health decline or even something worse. The author might have a responsibility as a friend to ensure Jake's well-being, especially since he's a parent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intention was to help, but the action might have been harmful. They might have been too quick to deny Jake's request without offering alternative solutions, like getting professional help or arranging for someone else to take him in. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not providing adequate support in a critical moment.\n"
