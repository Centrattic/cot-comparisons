He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling with depression. He showed up unannounced at the author's house, asking to stay. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but refused Jake himself, thinking it would help him get over his grief. Later, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. Losing a spouse is a traumatic experience, and he's already showing signs of depression and possible self-harm (taking sleeping pills). In such a vulnerable state, turning him away, even with good intentions, might not be the best support. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to \"get over it eventually,\" but that's a bit simplistic. Grief isn't something you just get over quickly, especially right after the loss. The author might not be considering the immediate emotional and mental health crisis Jake is in.\n\nAlso, allowing Jake's daughter to stay but not him could be seen as splitting the family, which might not be good for the child. Children need stability and the presence of their parent, especially after such a loss. The author might have thought they were helping by pushing Jake to face his grief, but in reality, Jake might need more immediate support and resources like a crisis hotline, therapist, or perhaps a temporary shelter arranged by the author instead of a blunt refusal.\n\nThe author's wife called them a massive asshole, which suggests that even within their own household, there's a disagreement. The author might not have considered all the consequences of their decision. While the intention was to help, the outcome was Jake sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous and could have been avoided if there were alternative arrangements made.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have the capacity to host Jake indefinitely, and setting boundaries is important. But in a crisis situation, perhaps there's a middle ground. Offering temporary help, connecting him with support services, or ensuring he has a safe place with someone else could have been better options. The author's refusal came across as harsh without providing alternatives, which is where they might have gone wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action, although intended to help, might have been inconsiderate of Jake's immediate needs and mental state. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
