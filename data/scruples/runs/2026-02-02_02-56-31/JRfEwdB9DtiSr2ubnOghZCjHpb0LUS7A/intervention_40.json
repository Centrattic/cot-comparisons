He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. So, the situation is that Jake is really struggling with grief, becoming depressed, using drugs to sleep, and ended up showing up at their door in the middle of the night with his daughter. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which led to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The user wanted to help Jake by not letting him stay, thinking he needs to get over it. But Jake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills and then going to sleep on the streets\u2014seem dangerous. Did the user consider Jake's mental state? Maybe they thought pushing Jake to handle it was good, but in reality, he might need support, not to be left alone. \n\nThe user's wife is upset, calling them a jerk. But the user's reasoning is that they wanted to help him move past the grief. However, grief is complex. Forbidding someone from staying might not be the right approach, especially when they're at risk of self-harm or harm to their child. Even if the user's intention was good, the outcome was negative. \n\nAlso, Jake's daughter was involved. If the user allowed the daughter to stay but not the father, maybe there's a safety issue there. Did they ensure the child was safe? The user might have thought they were helping, but in reality, they might have contributed to Jake's isolation. Grief often requires support, not being pushed away. \n\nSo, the user's action was to not let Jake stay, but Jake took it as rejection and ended up worse. The user might be at fault for not providing the necessary support. Even if they thought it was for the best, the outcome suggests that their approach was harmful. They should have considered alternative solutions, like getting professional help or ensuring Jake had somewhere safe to stay. \n\nIn summary, while the user's intention was to help, their method may have been flawed. They might have been too focused on pushing Jake to move on instead of offering the support he needed during his grief. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
