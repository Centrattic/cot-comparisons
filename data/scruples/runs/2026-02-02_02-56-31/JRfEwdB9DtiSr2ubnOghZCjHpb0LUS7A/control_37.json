He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's struggling, and the author of the post refused to let him stay overnight at their house, except for his daughter. Now Jake slept on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can affect people in different ways. Jake is in a lot of pain, possibly using drugs, and is not handling his loss well. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to \"get over it eventually,\" so they allowed his daughter but not him. But Jake ended up on the streets, which is a dangerous situation.\n\nThe key points here: the author's intention was to help, but the outcome was harmful. Was refusing to let Jake stay an appropriate way to help? Maybe there's a better way to support someone in grief without putting them in danger. Sleeping on the streets is not just about grief\u2014it's a safety issue. The author might not have considered that by not allowing Jake to stay, he might make a bad decision. \n\nAlso, the author's wife called them a massive asshole, which suggests that the community might see this as inconsiderate. Even if the intention was good, the action led to a negative consequence. The author might have failed to offer adequate support when needed most. Grief counseling or professional help could have been a better approach, but refusing shelter without alternatives might be seen as wrong.\n\nBut then again, the author might be trying to enforce some boundaries. However, in a crisis, people might not be in their right mind, and pushing someone to \"get over it\" isn't helpful. The line between helping and abandoning might be crossed here. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their action didn't consider Jake's immediate needs and safety.\n"
