He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend, Jake, who lost his wife and is struggling. The author refused to let Jake stay at their house, allowing only Jake's daughter. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a very vulnerable state after losing his spouse. The author's intention was to help him get over his grief by not letting him avoid his home, which might be part of the healing process. However, Jake's actions of going to the streets are concerning.\n\nBut, the author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but why not Jake? Maybe they were worried about enabling him to avoid dealing with his emotions. On the other hand, when Jake is in such a fragile state, refusing support might push him further into crisis. The wife's reaction suggests that the author's approach was harsh. \n\nThe key points: Was the author's refusal to let Jake stay compassionate or harmful? Denying shelter to someone in emotional and mental distress, especially when they have a child, might be seen as neglecting their immediate needs. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was that Jake slept on the streets, which is dangerous. The author might not have considered alternative solutions, like involving other friends or professional help. \n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset, indicating that the decision was not well-received. The author might have failed to balance supporting Jake while addressing his avoidance behavior. The action could be seen as too harsh, not considering the immediate mental health crisis. So, the author could be in the wrong for not providing necessary support during a critical time.\n"
