He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife. He's really struggling, using drugs, and not coping well. The friend shows up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The author says the daughter can stay but not Jake. Jake leaves, and later, the author finds out that Jake ended up sleeping on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong because they wanted to help Jake get through his grief.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about supporting a grieving friend. Grief is a tough time, and people often need support. The author's intention was to push Jake to overcome his grief, but does that mean it's right to turn him away? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, Jake was in a vulnerable state. He was using sleeping pills and struggling emotionally. When he came to the author's door at 1 AM, the author allowed the child to stay but not Jake. That seems a bit harsh, especially since Jake was in a crisis. The author's reasoning was to help him \"get over it eventually,\" but that might not be the best approach. Sometimes, people in deep grief need practical help and emotional support rather than being told they need to \"toughen up.\"\n\nAlso, the outcome was that Jake went back home, put the daughter to sleep, and then slept on the streets. That's a dangerous situation. Even if the author didn't intend for Jake to end up on the streets, by turning him away without alternative support, maybe the author failed to provide the necessary help. The author had the means to offer shelter but chose not to for the friend. While the author's wife was allowed to stay, Jake was left without a place, leading to a worse outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been trying to encourage independence. But when someone is in a crisis, especially with a child involved, not offering support can be seen as neglecting a responsibility. The author could have offered a place for both Jake and his daughter, maybe set some boundaries if needed, or connected them to other resources if they were overwhelmed. The way the situation was handled might have been too abrupt without considering Jake's immediate needs.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action was wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs, but generally, in cases of grief and mental health, support is crucial. Turning someone away, even with good intentions, can lead to worse consequences. So the author might be considered in the wrong for not providing the necessary support to a friend in a crisis, even if the intention wasn't to harm.\n"
