He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight after the friend's wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The friend, Jake, is dealing with severe depression after his wife's death. He's been drinking, sleeping a lot, and can't be in his house because it triggers memories. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself, which led Jake to sleep on the streets.\n\nNow, considering the context: grief can affect people in different ways, and Jake is clearly in a crisis. The author's intention was to push Jake to get through his grief, but the outcome was Jake sleeping outside, which is dangerous, especially with a young child. \n\nThe key points here are the author's actions versus the consequences. The author might have thought they were helping by not enabling Jake's avoidance behavior, but they didn't consider the immediate safety and well-being of Jake and his daughter. Allowing the daughter to stay but not the father could have left Jake without support, leading to his decision to sleep on the streets. \n\nThere's a balance between helping someone through grief and enforcing personal boundaries. The author might have valid reasons for wanting Jake to face his emotions, but the approach could have been more supportive. Maybe they could have set a different boundary, like allowing a temporary stay but encouraging professional help or involving other support systems. \n\nAlso, the author's wife reacted negatively, which suggests there's a personal conflict here. The author's wife might see this as a compassionate issue, while the author sees it as helping Jake move on. However, the immediate harm caused by Jake's decision (sleeping on the streets) is a serious concern. \n\nIn terms of morality and societal expectations, people often expect support from friends during crises, especially when children are involved. The author's refusal might be seen as a failure to provide necessary support, even if the intention was good. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author isn't a professional caregiver, and their home isn't a responsibility they're obligated to take on. However, knowing Jake's state and the potential danger, maybe they should have considered alternative solutions, like contacting social services or other friends, instead of turning him away entirely. \n\nSo, weighing the intentions against the consequences, the author's actions led to a dangerous situation. Even if the intention was to help Jake move past his grief, the lack of consideration for his immediate safety and the child's well-being might mean the author is in the wrong. The answer here could be A (Yes), because the outcome was harmful, and there might have been a more compassionate approach.\n"
