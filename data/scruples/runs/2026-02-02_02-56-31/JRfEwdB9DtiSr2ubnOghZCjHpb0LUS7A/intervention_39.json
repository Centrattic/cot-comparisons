He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay at their house after his wife died. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the facts. Jake's wife died a month ago. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, drinking, and sleeping a lot. He tried to take sleeping pills to cope. His daughter is three, and he's not neglecting her but is barely holding on. He went to the user's house in the middle of the night, and the user let his daughter stay but told Jake he couldn't. Jake left and then slept on the streets, which the user's wife found out. The user's reasoning was to help Jake get over the loss, but the wife is upset. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user made the right decision. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the user might think that allowing Jake to stay would make him avoid dealing with his loss, which isn't healthy. The user might believe that pushing him to stay in his house is part of the healing process. But on the other hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the user's refusal led him to sleep on the streets. That's dangerous, especially with a young child. Even if the user allowed the daughter to stay, Jake being alone on the streets could put the child at risk if something happened. \n\nThe user's approach seems a bit harsh. While setting boundaries is important, maybe there was a better way to handle it. Instead of saying \"he has to get over it,\" perhaps offering support while encouraging him to take steps toward healing. For example, suggesting a temporary stay under certain conditions, or connecting him with resources like counseling or a support group. Refusing entirely without alternatives might have been too abrupt, especially given Jake's mental state.\n\nAlso, the user's wife is upset, which indicates that the decision might not have considered the immediate safety and well-being of Jake and his daughter. Even if the user's intention was good, the outcome was harmful. The user could have found a middle ground\u2014maybe allowing Jake to stay temporarily but setting some boundaries, or ensuring he had another place to stay. \n\nAnother angle: the user's response might have been influenced by a desire to help Jake become independent again, but in a crisis, immediate needs like safety and emotional support are crucial. The user's action, while intended to be helpful, inadvertently caused harm. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user might be in the wrong for not providing adequate support despite their intentions. The right approach would be to balance helping Jake through his grief without forcing him into a situation that could lead to further harm.\n"
