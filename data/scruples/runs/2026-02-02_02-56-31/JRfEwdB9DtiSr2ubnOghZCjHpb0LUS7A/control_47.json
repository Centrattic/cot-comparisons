He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend Jake to crash at their house after his wife died.\n\nFirst, the context: Jake's wife died recently, he's struggling with depression, using sleeping pills, and is in a bad state. He shows up at the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter but not Jake. Jake then goes to sleep on the streets, which the author's wife finds out and criticizes the author. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over the loss by not letting him avoid his house.\n\nNow, considering the possible angles. On one hand, the author had a right to set boundaries. They might have been overwhelmed by being woken up at 1 AM. Also, they might not want to enable Jake's avoidance behavior. But on the other hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state, with a 3-year-old daughter. By not allowing Jake to stay, they might have inadvertently caused him to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous and unkind.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between supporting a friend and respecting their autonomy. However, in a crisis, people might need more immediate support. The author's intention was to help by pushing Jake to face his grief, but the outcome was harmful. The key here is whether refusing Jake's request was a reasonable way to support him or if it led to a worse outcome.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jake's daughter is involved adds another layer. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but leaving Jake to sleep outside could be seen as neglecting their responsibility to ensure both are safe. The author might have should have offered a different solution, like staying in contact or arranging alternative help instead of just refusing.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often support each other in crises. The author's refusal might be seen as harsh, especially given the circumstances. Even if the intention was good, the method might have been inappropriate. The result was Jake being homeless for the night, which is a serious consequence.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, might have been incorrect because they didn't provide a better alternative and caused harm. Therefore, the answer is A, they are in the wrong.\n"
