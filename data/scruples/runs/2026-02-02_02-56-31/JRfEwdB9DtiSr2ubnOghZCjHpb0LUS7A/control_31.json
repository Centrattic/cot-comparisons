He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend's wife died, and he's really struggling, even taking sleeping pills. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter at 1 AM asking for a place to stay. The author let the kid stay but not him. The friend then went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they were helping him move on.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the friend is in a crisis, the author allowed the child but not the friend, leading to the friend's possible self-harm or dangerous behavior. The author's reasoning is to help him get over the loss, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate need for support and safety.\n\nI need to consider empathy and practical aspects. Grief can make people act irrationally. The friend's actions (sleeping pills, leaving the house) suggest he might be at risk. The author's decision to not let him stay could be seen as not supporting him during a critical time. Even if the intention was to help him move on, the immediate need might be safety and support. Also, the friend's daughter is involved, so the author's wife might be right to be upset if the friend ended up in a dangerous situation because of their refusal.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they didn't offer full support when it was needed. While setting boundaries is important, in a friend's time of crisis, it's expected to offer more help, especially when there's a risk of self-harm. The author's action might have contributed to the friend's decision to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
