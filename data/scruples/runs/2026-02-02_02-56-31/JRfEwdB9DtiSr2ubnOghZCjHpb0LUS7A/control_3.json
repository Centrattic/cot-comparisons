He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is in the wrong after refusing their best friend Jake from staying at their house. The situation is that Jake's wife died, he's struggling, and he showed up unannounced with his daughter. The OP allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Now Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the wife called the OP an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a heavy topic. Jake is in a really bad place emotionally. He's using sleeping pills, avoiding his house, and the OP's decision might have led him to sleep outside. That's concerning because Jake's child was with him, and now he's homeless. The OP's intention was to help him move past the grief, but the outcome was negative.\n\nThe OP's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his wife's death. However, grief isn't something you can just push through. The OP might have thought setting a boundary was necessary, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate safety and emotional state of Jake and his child. The act of turning Jake away could be seen as not supporting him during a crisis. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake's daughter was present when he came over is important. The OP allowed the child to stay but not the father. That might have separated a parent from their child, which is a serious issue. Even if the intention was good, the consequence was that Jake was left alone, leading him to sleep on the streets. That's a dangerous situation for someone who's already in a fragile mental state.\n\nOn the other hand, the OP might have felt that they couldn't let Jake stay because they were trying to encourage independence. But in this case, Jake is in a state where he's not in control of his actions, using pills and drinking. The OP's refusal might have been a harsh boundary without providing alternative help, like calling a professional or getting him into a shelter. \n\nSo, considering all this, the OP's action could be seen as not fully supporting a grieving friend, especially when it led to a harmful outcome. They might have been in the wrong because they didn't account for the immediate danger and emotional needs of Jake and his daughter. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, did the OP have other options? Maybe they could have allowed Jake to stay temporarily while also encouraging him to seek help. But they didn't, so the result was negative. Yeah, I think A is the right choice here.\n"
