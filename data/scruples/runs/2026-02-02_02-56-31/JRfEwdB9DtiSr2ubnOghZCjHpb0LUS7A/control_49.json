He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's struggling, and the author refused to let him stay overnight after he showed up at their door. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, reasoning that he needs to get over it. Now Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. His wife died recently, and he's in a fragile mental state. He's using sleeping pills, which is concerning. When he shows up at the author's door, he's clearly in crisis. The author's decision to let the child stay but not Jake might have been well-intended, but refusing him entirely could lead to dangerous consequences. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about helping Jake get over his grief, but in reality, someone in deep depression might need support, not to be left alone. The fact that Jake ended up sleeping on the streets is a red flag. The author might not have realized the severity of Jake's state. Even if the intention was good, the action could be seen as neglecting the immediate needs of a friend in crisis. \n\nAlso, the friend's daughter is present, so the author allowed the child but not the father. That might not be the best approach either. Maybe the author should have found another way to help both of them. The wife's reaction as a \"massive asshole\" suggests that the author's decision was harsh. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the author didn't intend for Jake to end up on the streets, the refusal to offer shelter when someone is in such a vulnerable state could be seen as wrong. There's a balance between helping someone through grief and pushing them to cope. But when someone is actively suicidal (using sleeping pills, in this case), it's a crisis situation that requires immediate support, not a lesson in moving on. \n\nSo, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. They didn't provide necessary support, leading to Jake's decision to sleep on the streets, which could be life-threatening. However, the author might argue they were trying to help, but intentions don't excuse the outcome here. The key point is that in a mental health crisis, the priority should be safety, not forcing someone to deal with it alone.\n"
