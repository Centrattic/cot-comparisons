He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, drinking, and even taking sleeping pills. He can't handle being in his own house because it reminds him of his wife. One night, he shows up at the author's house with his 3-year-old daughter at 1 AM, asking to sleep there. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake goes back to his house, puts the kid to sleep, and sleeps on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they were right to push Jake to handle his grief.\n\nFirst, I should consider Jake's mental state. He's in deep grief, which is a severe situation. The author's intention was to help him move past the grief, but maybe they didn't consider his immediate needs. The author's action of not letting Jake stay might have forced him into a worse situation. Even though they allowed the daughter to stay, Jake ended up on the streets, which is dangerous. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might think that pushing Jake to be independent is part of helping him heal. But when someone is in crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts (taking sleeping pills), they need support, not being told to \"get over it.\" The author's response could be seen as callous, even if unintended. The fact that Jake's daughter is present adds another layer. The author allowed the child to sleep over but left her father to sleep on the streets. That might not be the best for the child either.\n\nSo, the key points are: mental health crisis, immediate need for support, the father's actions indicating possible self-harm, and the consequences of the author's decision. The author's reasoning was to help Jake overcome grief, but they might not have provided the necessary support during the crisis. The outcome was harmful, even if unintended. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering the severity of Jake's situation and the potential risks involved.\n"
