He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, sleep over after his wife died. The situation is really tough because Jake is clearly in a lot of pain, dealing with depression, and even considering self-harm. \n\nFirst, the user had a good intention by wanting to help Jake move past his grief. But when Jake showed up at their door with his daughter, they only allowed the daughter to stay. That decision led to Jake sleeping on the streets, which seems like a bad outcome. The user's wife is upset, calling them an asshole, and the user is second-guesting their choice.\n\nI need to consider the balance between helping someone in crisis and setting boundaries. The user did offer to let the daughter stay, which shows they weren't entirely turning Jake away. But Jake is a grown adult with his own responsibilities, and the user might have felt they couldn't handle both him and the child. However, Jake was in a vulnerable state, possibly a mental health crisis. The user's action might have inadvertently left him in a dangerous situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might not be responsible for solving Jake's long-term issues. They can't be expected to provide a home indefinitely. But maybe there was a way to offer more support, like suggesting a shelter or reaching out to other resources. The user's immediate reaction was to set a boundary, but maybe without considering the risks involved.\n\nJake's behavior is concerning\u2014using sleeping pills, inability to cope, and leaving his daughter asleep to sleep outside. The user might not have realized the severity of Jake's mental state at the time. However, allowing him to stay for the night could have provided temporary relief and prevented him from being on the streets. \n\nIn the end, while the user had good intentions, their decision might have contributed to a harmful situation for Jake. They could have offered a compromise or connected Jake with more appropriate support. So, there's a case to be made that the user was in the wrong, but it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. However, given the outcome, the user's strict boundary might have been unkind and not the best support in that moment.\n"
