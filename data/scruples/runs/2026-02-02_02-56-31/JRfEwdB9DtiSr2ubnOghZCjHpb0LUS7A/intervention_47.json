He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by not letting their best friend, Jake, stay at their house after his wife's death. The situation is pretty heavy. Jake's wife died in a car crash, he's really struggling, and he ended up taking sleeping pills and then showed up at the user's door. The user let Jake's daughter stay but not Jake himself. Then Jake slept on the streets, which made the user's wife upset.\n\nSo the user is torn between their own home's boundaries and their friend's emotional state. The user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief, but their action led to Jake going back to his house and then sleeping outside. The friend's daughter is three years old, so there's a child involved now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of the friend. Grief can make people do things they wouldn't normally do. Jake is in a very vulnerable state, and his actions (like taking sleeping pills) are concerning. The user's intention was to help him move past his grief, but by not allowing him to stay, they might have inadvertently caused him to take an even worse step. \n\nHowever, the user's responsibility as a friend is also in question. They allowed the child to stay, which was probably necessary for the child's safety, but leaving Jake alone in such a state might have been risky. The user might not have realized the immediate danger Jake was in. \n\nAnother angle is the user's wife's reaction. She called the user an asshole, which suggests she felt the action was harsh. The user's wife might have a different perspective on how to support a grieving friend. \n\nThe user might be in the wrong because, while setting boundaries is important, in this case, Jake's mental health could be deteriorating quickly. Not allowing him shelter might have been a failure to support him adequately, especially when he was in a crisis. The user should have considered alternative solutions, like contacting other friends, family, or even professional help instead of just saying no.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's intention wasn't to hurt Jake. They might have thought that allowing him to stay would enable his avoidance of grief rather than helping him process it. But in reality, Jake needed immediate emotional support and a safe place, not just a lesson in coping.\n\nSo, the balance here is between personal boundaries and the friend's immediate needs. The user's action might have been too abrupt without considering the full context of Jake's crisis. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because the user's approach might have contributed to Jake's decision to sleep on the streets, which is a dangerous situation for both him and his daughter.\n"
