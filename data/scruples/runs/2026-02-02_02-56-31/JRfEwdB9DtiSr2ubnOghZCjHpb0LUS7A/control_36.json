He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their friend Jake stay at their house after his wife died.\n\nSo, Jake's wife died, and he's really struggling. He's depressed, using pills, and his kid is involved. He shows up at the author's house late at night, and the author lets the kid stay but not Jake. Jake then goes to sleep on the streets. The author's wife is upset with them, but they think they're right because they wanted Jake to move past his grief.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, Jake is in a very vulnerable state. His mental health is a concern. He's using pills to sleep, which is risky. The author's intention was to help him cope, but their action might have pushed him to do something dangerous. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Maybe they thought the daughter needed a safe place, but Jake needed support too.\n\nThe problem here is that Jake's actions (sleeping on the streets) could be life-threatening, especially if he's under the influence of pills. The author's approach might have been well-intentioned but not practical. Maybe they should have considered a safer alternative for Jake, like involving other friends or family, or even contacting professional help. By not letting him stay, they might have contributed to his decision to sleep outside, which could lead to serious consequences.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to let the daughter stay but not Jake\u2014while understandable\u2014might have separated the family further. Jake might have needed to stay with his daughter for emotional support. Not allowing him could be seen as not fully supporting his recovery. The author's wife calling them an \"asshole\" suggests that there's a conflict in perspectives here. The author might be trying to push Jake to be stronger, but grief isn't that simple. Sometimes people need time and support, not just tough love.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author didn't intend for Jake to end up on the streets, their action directly led to that outcome. They might not have considered the immediate risks to Jake's well-being. So, even if their intention was to help, the result was harmful. Therefore, they could be in the wrong for not providing the necessary support during such a critical time. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
