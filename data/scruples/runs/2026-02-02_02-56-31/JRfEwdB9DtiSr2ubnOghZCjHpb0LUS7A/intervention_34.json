He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend crash at their house after his wife died. Let me break down the situation. \n\nJake's wife died recently, and he's handling it really badly. He's drinking, sleeping a lot, and struggling to cope. He showed up at the user's house in the middle of the night with his 3-year-old daughter, asking to stay. The user allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake, telling him he needs to get over it. Jake left angry and later slept on the streets.\n\nThe user argues that their intention was to help Jake move on from his grief. The wife is upset, calling the user a massive asshole. The user is split on whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a complex experience. While the user's intention might have been to help, refusing shelter to someone in such a vulnerable state could be seen as harmful, especially when they have a young child. Jake's actions, like taking sleeping pills and being in a state of depression, indicate he's in a crisis.\n\nHowever, the user allowed the daughter to stay, so they weren't completely unhelpful. But refusing Jake because he \"has to get over it\" might be a harsh approach. Grief isn't something you just recover from quickly; it's a process. The user might not have considered Jake's immediate need for support and instead focused on long-term solutions. \n\nAlso, Jake ended up on the streets, which is dangerous and not a safe solution. The user's response didn't account for the immediate risk to both Jake and his daughter. Even if the user didn't want to enable dependency, the situation required compassion and practical help. \n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often step in during crises. The user's refusal, despite good intentions, might have been too abrupt. They could have offered temporary shelter while encouraging professional help or other support systems. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user might be in the wrong because their approach lacked empathy and didn't address Jake's urgent needs, leading to a worse outcome. Therefore, answer A.\n"
