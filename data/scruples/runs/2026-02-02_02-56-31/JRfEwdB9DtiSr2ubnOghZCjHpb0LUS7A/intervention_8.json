He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay at their house after his wife's death. The situation is pretty heavy. Jake is dealing with a lot of grief and has become really depressed, even using sleeping pills to cope. He showed up unannounced at the user's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay. The user allowed the daughter to stay but told Jake he couldn't. Jake left in anger, and later, went to sleep on the streets after putting his daughter to sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They wanted to help Jake move past his grief, thinking that by not letting him stay, they were pushing him to deal with it. But Jake's reaction was extreme, and their wife is upset with the user. The user's intention was to help, but the outcome was bad.\n\nNow, the other side. Jake was in a vulnerable state. His wife just died, and he's struggling. His actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, showing up at a friend's house late at night\u2014indicate serious emotional distress. Putting his daughter to sleep and then going to sleep on the streets is concerning, possibly neglecting his child's safety. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. But Jake's actions after leaving might suggest he wasn't in a stable state to care for his daughter. However, the user didn't know that at the time.\n\nThe user's responsibility here is a bit tricky. They did offer a place for the daughter but not Jake, which might have been a way to show support without enabling his avoidance. However, Jake's subsequent behavior shows that he might need more help. Could the user have done more? Maybe offered to stay with them for a short time, or suggested other resources? But they might not have had the capacity, given the late hour and a child involved.\n\nAlso, the user's wife is upset, which adds to the tension. The user's intention was good, but the execution might have lacked empathy or understanding of Jake's mental state. The user didn't kick Jake out directly, but their refusal to let him stay contributed to his decision to sleep outside. Is the user responsible for that outcome? It's a gray area. They might not be entirely at fault, but they could have handled it better.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user might not be in the wrong per se, but their approach could have been more compassionate. They did allow the daughter to stay, which is a positive action, but turning Jake away without alternatives might have been hasty. The key is whether there's a balance between helping a grieving friend and setting boundaries. The user's actions might not be malicious, but the consequences were severe. So, the answer might lean towards A, that they are in the wrong, because their refusal led to Jake being on the streets, even if unintentionally. But the user's intention was to help, which complicates it. The line between helping and enabling is thin here. Maybe the right answer is A, as they could have found a better way to support Jake without turning him away entirely.\n"
