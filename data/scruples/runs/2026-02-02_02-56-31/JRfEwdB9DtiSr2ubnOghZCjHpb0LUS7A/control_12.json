He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend, Jake, to stay overnight at their house after his wife died. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider several factors.\n\nFirst, Jake's mental state: his wife died in a car crash, and he's handling it terribly. He's depressed, drinking, and using sleeping pills. He's also a father to a 3-year-old, which adds to the complexity. The author's wife and he were woken up at 1 AM by Jake and his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake left and later went to sleep on the streets, which the author's wife found out and criticized the author for being an asshole. The author justifies his decision by saying he wanted to help Jake get over his grief.\n\nNow, the key points here are Jake's mental health and the potential risk of him harming himself. The author's intention was good\u2014to push Jake to face his emotions and move on. However, Jake's actions of taking sleeping pills and his fragile state suggest that he might not be in a position to be left alone. By sending him away, the author might have inadvertently put Jake at risk of harm. Even though the author allowed the daughter to stay, Jake's presence could have provided stability for the child, especially if the father is struggling.\n\nAnother angle is the role of the author as a friend. While it's important to encourage resilience, there's a balance between pushing someone to heal and ensuring their safety. In a crisis, practical support is crucial. The author's decision could be seen as neglecting the immediate need for safety and emotional support, especially given that Jake was in a vulnerable state. The author might have failed to consider alternative solutions, like contacting other friends or family, or reaching out to social services to ensure Jake and his daughter are safe.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were trying to be tough love, pushing Jake to confront his grief. But in cases of severe depression and suicidal tendencies (like using sleeping pills), professional help is necessary. The author could have refused entry but still helped by contacting someone else or a crisis center. Just sending him away might be seen as not doing enough.\n\nThe daughter's safety is also a factor. If Jake is the primary caregiver, sending him away but letting the daughter stay could be problematic if Jake isn't there to care for her. However, the author allowed the daughter to stay, which might indicate they considered her well-being. Still, Jake's absence could have put the child in a precarious situation if he wasn't there to care for her, especially if he later went to the streets.\n\nEthically, friends have a responsibility to look out for each other's well-being, especially in times of crisis. The author's actions might be seen as failing in that duty. Even if the intention was to help, the outcome (Jake ending up on the streets) suggests that the approach was flawed. The author might have been too focused on their own method of support without considering the practical consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, the execution might have been harmful. Friends should prioritize immediate safety and connect individuals in crisis with appropriate resources. The author's refusal to let Jake stay, without providing alternative support, could be seen as inconsiderate and potentially dangerous. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
