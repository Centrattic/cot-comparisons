He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay at their house after his wife's death. Jake was in a bad place, using sleeping pills, and showed up with his daughter. The person allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can make people act out of character. Jake's mental state is fragile, and he's not handling it well. The person's intention was to help him move past his grief, but their action led to a negative outcome. \n\nBut was the action justified? By refusing Jake but letting his daughter stay, they might have thought they were encouraging self-reliance. However, Jake's state of mind\u2014using sleeping pills and being emotionally unstable\u2014could mean he wasn't in a position to care for his daughter alone. The person's wife called them a jerk, which adds another layer of personal conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might feel they weren't responsible for Jake's decisions afterward. The question is whether they should have anticipated that turning him away would lead to him sleeping outside. Maybe they didn't consider the immediate safety of Jake and his daughter. There's a line between helping someone through grief and pushing them to handle it alone when they're not ready.\n\nAlso, the person's wife's reaction suggests that the decision wasn't well-received, and maybe there was a lack of communication or understanding about the severity of Jake's situation. The person might have thought they were being firm, but in reality, they might have failed to provide necessary support during a critical time.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention was to help Jake, the outcome was harmful. By not allowing him to stay, they might have contributed to his decision to sleep on the streets, which puts both him and his daughter at risk. The error here is not in the intention but in the execution, as they didn't consider the potential consequences of their refusal. Therefore, the answer leans towards \"A\" (they are in the wrong).\n"
