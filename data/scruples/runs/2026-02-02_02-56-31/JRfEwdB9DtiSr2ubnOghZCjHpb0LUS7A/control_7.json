He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their best friend Jake losing his wife, and the author not letting him crash at their house. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is dealing with a significant loss, which is a traumatic event. He's struggling with depression, drinking, and sleep issues. When he showed up at the author's door, he was in a vulnerable state. The author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his house. But allowing the daughter to stay but not Jake might have been a problem because they're a unit, especially with a young child involved.\n\nThe author's wife called them an asshole, which suggests there's a conflict in the household about how to handle Jake's situation. The author's intention was to help, but the outcome was Jake being on the streets, which is dangerous. Even if the intention was good, the result was harmful. Maybe there was a better way to support Jake without abandoning him. For example, offering temporary help, connecting him with support groups, or getting professional help.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jake has a 3-year-old daughter complicates things. Parents usually don't leave their kids unattended for long, so if Jake was going to be out, he should have someone watch the child. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which separated a parent from their child, which might not be responsible. The author might have thought they were helping Jake face his grief, but in reality, they might have ignored his immediate need for support and safety.\n\nAnother angle is the author's approach to grief. Grief is different for everyone, and Jake's way of handling it is by trying to avoid the house. The author's refusal might have been counterproductive. Instead of forcing him to confront his grief immediately, providing a safe space could have been more supportive. The author's decision might have caused Jake to take drastic measures, which could have been prevented with more empathy and a different approach.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author's action, while intending to help, led to negative consequences. The key is whether the action was appropriate given the circumstances. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intention, but the action itself might be considered harmful. Allowing Jake to stay temporarily could have provided immediate relief and ensured the child's safety. The author's refusal might have been a failure to consider the full impact of their decision on Jake's mental health and the child's well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to help, the outcome suggests that their approach was flawed. They might not be entirely in the wrong because they had good intentions, but their action could be seen as harmful. However, the fact that Jake ended up on the streets and the daughter was left alone might mean the author is in the wrong for not providing the necessary support during a crisis.\n"
