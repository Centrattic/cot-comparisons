He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife's death. The friend, Jake, is really struggling, using drugs, and the user wanted to push him to face his grief instead of avoiding it. The user's wife is upset, but they think their intention was to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grieving is tough, and people deal with it differently. Jake is in a fragile state, and the user's approach was to be firm, not allowing Jake to stay. But maybe the user didn't realize the immediate danger. Jake was taking sleeping pills, which could be risky, and ended up sleeping on the streets. That's concerning for his and his daughter's safety.\n\nThe user's intention was to help him get over his grief. But forcing someone to confront it when they're not ready can backfire. Jake might need support and a safe place to stay, not a refusal. The user's wife is upset, which adds another layer. Not allowing a friend to stay could make him feel abandoned in his time of need. Even if the user's intention was good, the action might have been harmful. The key points are the safety of both Jake and his daughter, the potential for self-harm with the pills, and the importance of emotional support during grief. So the user might be at fault here.\n"
