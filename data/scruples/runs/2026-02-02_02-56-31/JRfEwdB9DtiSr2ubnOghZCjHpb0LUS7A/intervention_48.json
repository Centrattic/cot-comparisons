He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they were wrong for not allowing their best friend, Jake, to crash at their house after Jake's wife died. The situation is pretty heavy, so I need to consider both sides carefully.\n\nFirst, the user's perspective: They let Jake's daughter stay but not Jake himself. Their reasoning was to help Jake get over his wife's death by pushing him to handle it. They might be thinking that by not letting him stay, they're forcing him to face his reality. But the result was Jake sleeping on the streets, which is bad. The user might feel they were trying to be strong for his friend's sake, even if it backfired.\n\nNow, Jake's side: He's in a severe emotional crisis, dealing with depression, possibly using alcohol and sleeping pills. He showed up unannounced with his daughter because he couldn't cope. The user's response might have been too harsh, not considering how fragile Jake is. Even though the user allowed the daughter to stay, refusing Jake could have pushed him to make a desperate decision. The wife called the user an asshole, which suggests that the user's action might not have been kind or supportive enough during a time when empathy is crucial.\n\nThe user's intention was good, but the execution might have been wrong. When someone is in a deep depression and crisis, pushing them can lead to worse outcomes. The user didn't offer an alternative solution, like staying with another friend or contacting a professional. Instead, Jake ended up sleeping outside, which is dangerous, especially with his mental state and the presence of his young daughter.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's safety, even though Jake didn't neglect her, the user allowed her to stay. That's a positive step, but refusing the father might have left the motherless family without support. The user could have perhaps set boundaries, like limiting the stay duration or involving other resources while still offering temporary shelter.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when a close friend is in such a crisis, offering support and understanding is typically expected. The user's approach might come off as cold or judgmental, even if the intention was to help. The key is that Jake needed emotional support and practical help, not a lesson in resilience during a time of extreme vulnerability.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's action led to negative consequences for Jake and his daughter. While the intention was to help Jake move past his grief, the method was counterproductive. The user might not have considered the immediate risks and emotional needs. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
