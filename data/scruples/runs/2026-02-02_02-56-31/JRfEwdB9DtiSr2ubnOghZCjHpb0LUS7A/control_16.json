He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, recently lost his wife and is struggling. The author refused to let Jake stay at their house but allowed Jake's daughter to stay. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a very personal experience, and people handle it differently. Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author's decision might be seen as harsh. Letting the daughter stay but not the father seems contradictory because Jake might need support to care for his child properly. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief, but forcing him to stay in his house might not be the right approach. Pushing someone in deep depression to be alone could lead to worse outcomes, as seen here with Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to encourage Jake to move past his grief, thinking that staying at home is making it worse. However, the method of refusal\u2014denying shelter without alternative support\u2014could be seen as not providing adequate help. The author's wife is upset because the action led to Jake being homeless, which indicates a lack of support. The author's decision didn't consider Jake's immediate emotional state and his possible need for a safe space to process his grief.\n\nThe key points are: the author's refusal might have unintended consequences, the decision to allow the child but not the father could separate the family, and the author's approach might not be the most supportive in a crisis. While intentions matter, the outcome here is negative. The author might not be entirely wrong, but their approach could be more compassionate. However, in terms of right or wrong, the action led to harm, so the author might be in the wrong for not providing necessary support during a critical time.\n"
