He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife's death. The situation is pretty intense. The friend, Jake, is struggling with depression, drinking, and taking sleeping pills. He showed up unannounced with his 3-year-old daughter, and the user let the daughter stay but not him. Then Jake slept on the streets, and the user's wife is upset.\n\nSo the user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief, not kick him out. But the wife thinks the user was harsh. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a heavy topic. Jake is in a vulnerable state. The user's intention was to help by pushing him to cope. But allowing the daughter to stay but not the father might have caused Jake to feel abandoned. Also, the user didn't offer any alternative support, like helping find a shelter or another place. Just saying he can't stay and then leaving him to sleep outside seems harsh, even if the user's intention was good.\n\nFriendship involves support during tough times. The user is a best friend, which implies a deeper level of care. While setting boundaries is okay, in this case, the friend was in crisis and needed support. The user's action might have been a lack of empathy. Even if they thought they were helping, the result was harmful. The user could have said no but offered other help. So maybe the user is in the wrong because they didn't provide enough support, leading Jake to end up on the streets. The answer is likely A.\n"
