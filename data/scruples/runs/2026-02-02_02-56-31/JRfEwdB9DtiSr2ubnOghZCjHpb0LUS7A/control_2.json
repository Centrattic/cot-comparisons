He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their best friend Jake, whose wife died. Jake is really struggling, and he showed up at their house with his daughter late at night, asking for a place to stay. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets. The author's wife called them a massive asshole, but they think they're not at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a lot of emotional pain, dealing with loss. He's not handling it well, using drugs (sleeping pills), and is in a vulnerable state. When he shows up at the author's door, it's late, and they're woken up. The author allows the daughter but not Jake. Then Jake ends up on the streets, which is dangerous.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and support. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief, but their action might have been too harsh. Refusing someone in such a crisis, especially when they're already emotionally unstable, could be seen as uncaring. The author might have thought they were helping by not letting Jake stay, but not allowing him a safe place to sleep could lead to dangerous consequences. Also, the daughter is involved, so their well-being is a factor. The author's wife is upset because they don't see the harm in their action, but others might argue that Jake needed support, not rejection. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be concerned about their own well-being, dealing with a late-night interruption. But in a crisis, friends often need to step in. The decision to not let Jake stay might not have considered the immediate risk he's in. Maybe there's a middle ground, like finding another shelter option for him. But the author's refusal left him with no choice but the streets. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's action could be seen as not supporting a friend in dire need. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide necessary support, especially considering Jake's state. However, some might argue it's not their responsibility. But given the situation, the author's decision had negative consequences, so they might be at fault.\n"
