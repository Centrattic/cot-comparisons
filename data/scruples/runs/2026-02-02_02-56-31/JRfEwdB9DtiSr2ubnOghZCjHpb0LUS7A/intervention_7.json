He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to stay overnight after the friend's wife died. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand all the details. The friend, Jake, is dealing with severe grief, which has led him to depression and substance abuse. He showed up unannounced at the user's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking for a place to stay. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, leading Jake to sleep on the streets afterward.\n\nThe user's reasoning was that Jake needs to \"get over it eventually.\" But is that a valid approach? Grief is a personal process. Forcing someone to go through it without support might not be helpful. The user's wife is upset, which adds another layer. The user might be thinking they're helping by pushing Jake to handle it, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate danger of Jake's state.\n\nJake was taking sleeping pills, which could be a sign of self-harm risk. If the user had known that, they might have handled it differently. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which could leave Jake vulnerable. Even if the intention was good, the result was Jake sleeping outside with his child. That's concerning, especially for a 3-year-old.\n\nThe user might argue they wanted Jake to be independent, but in a crisis, support is crucial. There's a balance between helping and pushing someone to handle things alone. The user could have set boundaries while still offering support, like allowing Jake to stay but encouraging professional help. Alternatively, they could have connected Jake with other resources if they couldn't host him.\n\nThe fact that Jake's daughter is involved complicates things. The user allowed the daughter to stay, which shows they care about the child. But leaving Jake alone might have put the child at risk if Jake wasn't stable enough to care for her. The user might not have realized how dire Jake's situation was.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, the action of refusing to let him stay without providing alternative support might have been harmful. Grief requires compassion and practical help, not pushing someone away. The user might have a good intention, but the outcome suggests they were wrong in their approach.\n"
