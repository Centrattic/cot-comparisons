He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend Jake to crash at their house after Jake's wife died. \n\nSo the situation is that Jake's wife passed away, and he's struggling with depression and possibly suicidal thoughts. He showed up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his 3-year-old daughter. The author offered to let the daughter stay but refused Jake. Jake then went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're right because they wanted to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jake's state of mind. He's in a lot of emotional pain, and he's mentioned taking sleeping pills, which could indicate he's at risk of self-harm. When someone is in that state, refusing help\u2014even if the helper's intention is good\u2014can be dangerous. The author's action might have pushed Jake to a point where he made a harmful decision.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jake needs to overcome his grief. But in a crisis, the immediate need is safety. Jake's presence at the author's house might have been disruptive (waking them up at 1 AM), but the child's presence complicates things. The author let the daughter stay but not Jake. However, Jake then went to sleep on the streets, which is risky, especially with a young child in the house. Even if the author didn't know, the action of sending Jake out could be seen as neglecting his well-being and possibly the child's safety if he's not there to care for her properly.\n\nThe author might not have considered that Jake's actions (like taking pills) were a cry for help. The refusal could have been a trigger for Jake to act on his suicidal thoughts. Also, as a best friend, the author might have a responsibility to ensure Jake's safety, especially when he's in such a vulnerable state.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they had to set boundaries. But in a mental health crisis, the usual social boundaries might not apply. The priority should be preventing harm. The author's wife is upset because they see the action as cruel, while the author thinks it's for Jake's good. But the outcome was Jake sleeping on the streets, which is worse than intended.\n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't have a better alternative. Maybe they should have allowed Jake to stay but insisted on some form of support, like a professional. Refusing help in a crisis can be harmful. So the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because their action (or inaction) led to Jake being in a dangerous situation, even if their intention was to help him move on.\n"
