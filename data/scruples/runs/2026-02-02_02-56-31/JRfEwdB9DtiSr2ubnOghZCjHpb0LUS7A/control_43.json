He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay after his wife died. So, the situation is that Jake lost his wife, he's really struggling, and he showed up at the author's house with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but told Jake he couldn't because he needed to get over it. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets.\n\nHmm. The first thing that comes to mind is empathy. Jake is dealing with a huge loss, which is a major life event. Grief can make people act out or need support. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, but by refusing him shelter, maybe they caused more harm. Jake was in a vulnerable state, possibly suicidal (he mentioned sleeping pills), so pushing him away might have been dangerous.\n\nAlso, the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. That seems a bit contradictory. If Jake was struggling so much that he couldn't be at his house, maybe he needed immediate support. The author might have thought they were helping by making him face his grief, but in reality, he might not have the coping mechanisms yet. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets is concerning. The wife is now upset with the author, and it's possible the author didn't realize the severity of Jake's mental state.\n\nBut wait, the author did offer a place for the daughter, so they weren't completely dismissive. Maybe they were trying to set boundaries. However, in a crisis, sometimes people need immediate help, even if it's not the ideal solution long-term. The author's approach might have been too rigid. Jake's actions suggest he wasn't in a position to make good decisions for himself, so maybe the author should have been more compassionate and allowed him to stay as well, while also encouraging professional help.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been worried about enabling Jake's avoidance of grief. But in a life-or-death situation, immediate action is usually preferred. The fact that Jake went to sleep on the streets after being refused points to the author's decision possibly contributing to that outcome. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't consider the immediate danger Jake was in and refused him shelter despite his critical state.\n"
