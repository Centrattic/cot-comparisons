He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that their best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself because they thought he needed to get over it. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a lot of emotional pain, dealing with grief, and has a young child to care for. The author's intention was to help him move past the grief by not enabling him. But the result was that Jake went to sleep outside, which is dangerous, especially with a child involved. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that by allowing Jake to stay, they might be preventing him from dealing with his emotions. But on the other hand, turning him away when he's in a vulnerable state, even with good intentions, could have serious consequences. It's important to assess whether the author's action was reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nJake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, being in a state of depression\u2014indicate he's not in a stable mental state. The author might not have considered that Jake's immediate need was emotional support and safety, not just pushing him to move on. By not allowing him to stay, the author might have unintentionally left him in a dangerous situation. \n\nMoreover, the fact that Jake's daughter was allowed to stay but he wasn't might be seen as inconsistent. If the daughter needed to be in a safe place, then Jake might need that stability too. The author's wife's reaction suggests that the decision was harsh. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author might have good intentions, the outcome could be considered harmful. The responsibility of a friend in such a situation is to provide support, even if it's not in the way the author intended. Sleepover refusal leading to someone sleeping on the streets might cross a line, especially when someone is in crisis. \n\nHowever, the author might not have considered all options, like contacting other friends or family, or maybe involving professional help. But in the moment, the decision to not let Jake stay might have been based on the belief that he needed to face his grief. \n\nThe key here is whether the author prioritized their own belief about how Jake should handle his grief over Jake's immediate safety and well-being. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets, despite having a child, suggests that the author's actions had unintended negative consequences. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't provide the necessary support that Jake needed in a crisis, even if their intentions were good. But I need to check if there's a middle ground where the author could have set boundaries while still offering some support. However, given the outcome, it's more about the lack of support directly leading to a harmful situation. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
