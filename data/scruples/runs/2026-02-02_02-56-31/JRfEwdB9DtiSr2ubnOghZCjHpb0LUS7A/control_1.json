He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The friend, Jake, is really struggling, dealing with depression, and even taking sleeping pills. He shows up at their door with his daughter. The person says the daughter can stay but not Jake, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets later.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's in a lot of pain, and his actions might be impulsive. The person might have thought they were helping by pushing Jake to handle his grief, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate consequences. By letting the daughter stay but not Jake, they might have inadvertently caused Jake to take an even worse action. \n\nThe person's wife is upset, calling them an asshole, which suggests that their approach might not have been supportive enough. Even if the intention was good, the result was harmful. Maybe they should have offered more support, like allowing Jake to stay temporarily while ensuring the child's safety. \n\nAlso, Jake's mental state is critical. He's using sleeping pills, which is a red flag for potential self-harm. By not letting him stay, the person might have removed a support system for both him and his daughter. The priority in such a situation should be ensuring no one comes to harm, even if it means adjusting one's own comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might have been trying to encourage independence. But when someone is in crisis, especially with a child involved, the immediate need is safety and emotional support, not pushing them to \"get over it.\" The line between helping and being cold can be thin. \n\nSo, considering the outcome\u2014Jake sleeping on the streets\u2014it seems like the person's actions led to a negative result. They might not have considered all possible consequences and didn't provide adequate support. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
