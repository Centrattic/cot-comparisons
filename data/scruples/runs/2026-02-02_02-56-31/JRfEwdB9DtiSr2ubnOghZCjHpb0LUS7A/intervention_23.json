He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is really struggling. He ended up knocking on their door in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The person let the daughter stay but not Jake, thinking he needed to get over it. Then Jake went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The wife is upset with the person, but they think they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a heavy burden, and Jake is clearly in a bad place. He's depressed, using sleeping pills, and avoiding his house. When he showed up at their door with his daughter, it's a sign he's desperate. The person allowed the daughter to stay but not him. That might have been a way to help without enabling his avoidance, but maybe it was too harsh. \n\nJake's actions afterward\u2014sleeping on the streets\u2014shows he's in serious trouble. The person might have thought they were pushing Jake to face his grief, but refusing him shelter could have led to a dangerous situation. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was bad. They might not have considered the immediate safety of Jake and his daughter. \n\nAlso, the person's wife is upset, indicating that their decision had emotional consequences. Maybe the person should have found another way to support Jake, like getting professional help or involving other friends. Refusing him outright might have been seen as abandoning him during a crisis. \n\nOn the other hand, they did allow the daughter to stay, which shows they weren't completely uncaring. But not allowing Jake might have been a mistake. In times of grief, people need support, and turning someone away can be hurtful, even if the intention was to help them heal. \n\nSo, considering all this, the person might be in the wrong because their action, while well-intentioned, didn't address Jake's immediate needs and possibly endangered him and his daughter.\n"
