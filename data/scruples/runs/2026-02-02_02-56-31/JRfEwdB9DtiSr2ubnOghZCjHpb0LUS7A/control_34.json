He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend, Jake, to crash at their house after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake's wife died, and he's dealing with depression, drinking, and using sleeping pills. He showed up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter and asked to stay. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then left, went home, put the daughter to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author made a wrong decision by not letting Jake stay. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have a point in wanting to help Jake become independent again. If Jake is relying too much on others, maybe the author is trying to push him to handle his grief on his own. But on the other hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state\u2014depressed, using sleeping pills, and in emotional distress. He showed up because he needed help, and the author's refusal might have forced him into a worse situation, like sleeping on the streets, which could be dangerous.\n\nAlso, Jake has a 3-year-old daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not the father. That seems a bit inconsistent. Maybe the author wanted to protect the daughter but not the father. But Jake might need support to take care of the daughter properly. If the author\u4e0d\u8ba9 Jake stay, maybe he's less capable of taking care of the child, which could be a risk.\n\nThe author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief, but the action of refusing to let him stay led to Jake sleeping on the streets. That seems like a negative outcome, and the author might not have considered the consequences. Even if the intention was good, the result was harmful. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake was in such a state that he needed sleeping pills and was drinking might indicate he's not in a good mental state. Forcing him to stay in his house alone when he's struggling could be dangerous. The author might have thought they were helping, but maybe they should have considered that Jake needed more immediate support rather than being pushed towards independence.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author is supposed to support Jake through this crisis. Refusing to let him stay, especially when he's in such a vulnerable state, could be seen as not being supportive. However, the author might have valid concerns about enabling Jake's dependency or not making him work through his grief. \n\nBut the key point is that Jake's actions (taking sleeping pills, drinking) might indicate a risk of self-harm. The author might have a duty to ensure his safety, even if it's not their direct responsibility. Sleeping on the streets in that condition could be life-threatening. \n\nThe author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Maybe they thought the daughter needed a safe place, but Jake needed to be on his own. However, Jake's ability to care for the daughter might be compromised if he's not properly rested or sober. So, by not letting Jake stay, the author might be putting the child at risk indirectly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions, their action might have led to a harmful outcome. They might not have considered the immediate risks to Jake's safety and the well-being of his daughter. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because they didn't provide necessary support during a critical time, even if their motivation was to help him heal in the long run.\n"
