He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. Jake is really struggling, dealing with depression, and the user refused him because they thought he needed to get over it. The user's wife is upset, but the user thinks they're helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a tough time, and people might act out of character. Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the user's refusal might have pushed him to sleep on the streets. That seems harsh, even if the intention was to help. But grief can make people do things they wouldn't otherwise. \n\nOn the other hand, the user did allow Jake's daughter to stay, which is a good move. But refusing Jake himself might have been too abrupt. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries while still offering support. The user might have thought they were being practical, but the outcome was Jake being homeless for the night. That's pretty serious. \n\nThe key points here are empathy and the actual consequences. Even if the user's intention was to encourage Jake to get better, the immediate effect was harmful. It's possible that the user didn't realize how fragile Jake was. However, the user's wife is upset, which suggests that the user's decision might not have considered the full emotional impact.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (ITA) because the refusal led to a negative outcome, even if unintended. The user's approach could be seen as lacking compassion in a critical moment. But there's also the angle of not being in the wrong if they meant well. However, in AITA scenarios, intentions matter but so do the real-world consequences. \n\nTherefore, the most balanced answer is A. The user is in the wrong because their action, though well-intended, resulted in harm. They should have found a way to support Jake without cutting him off completely, especially when he was in such a vulnerable state.\n"
