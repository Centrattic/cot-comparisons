He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight after his wife died. The friend, Jake, is clearly struggling, with depression and possibly turning to drugs. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter, asking to stay. The author said the daughter could stay but not Jake. Jake then went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they were right to push Jake to handle his grief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. Jake is in a lot of emotional pain. After a spouse's death, it's common for people to have intense reactions, and his behavior of drinking, sleeping pills, and avoiding the house might be signs of severe depression or grief. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief by not enabling him to stay in a place that triggers bad memories. However, leaving Jake without any support might have led to a worse outcome, as he ended up on the streets.\n\nBut the author did allow the daughter to stay, which is a good gesture. They might have thought that by not letting Jake stay, they were pushing him to take responsibility. However, Jake's actions afterward suggest that he was in a vulnerable state. The author might not have considered that Jake's decision to sleep on the streets was a direct result of being turned away. Even though the author's intention was to help, the outcome was negative. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they can't be responsible for Jake's every need and that setting boundaries is necessary. But when someone is in a crisis, friends might need to go the extra mile. The author could have offered an alternative, like finding another place for Jake to stay or contacting other friends or family. Denying him shelter without providing alternatives might be seen as uncaring, even if the intention was good.\n\nAlso, the daughter is a child, and while the author allowed her to stay, Jake needed support too. The key issue here is whether the author's action of not letting Jake stay, while allowing his daughter to stay, is a reasonable boundary given the circumstances. If the author was truly trying to help, maybe there was a better way to approach it. For example, staying with Jake and his daughter for the night could offer immediate support while still encouraging him to eventually return home. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action might be seen as well-meaning but perhaps not considering the immediate emotional state of Jake. The outcome was that Jake ended up on the streets, which is worse than the author's intention. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not finding a compassionate solution that still addressed Jake's needs.\n"
