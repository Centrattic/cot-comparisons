He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not letting their friend Jake stay over after his wife died. So first, let's break down the situation.\n\nJake lost his wife in a car crash a month ago and is really struggling. He's depressed, drinking or sleeping a lot, and while he's not neglecting his daughter, he's barely coping. He told the user he can't be in his house, uses sleeping pills, and then showed up at their door in the middle of the night. The user allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake, telling him he needed to get over it. Jake left angry, then later ended up sleeping on the streets. The user's wife is upset, but the user thinks they were right to push Jake to deal with it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about compassion, the user's intentions, and the consequences. The user intended to help by not enabling Jake's avoidance. But Jake's reaction was to leave his daughter and sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. The user's friend is clearly in a vulnerable state, possibly in a crisis.\n\nWhen someone is grieving, especially with depression and possible suicidal thoughts (since he's taking sleeping pills), it's important to have support, not to be left isolated. The user refused Jake, maybe thinking he should face his grief, but that might not have considered his mental state. Maybe the user should have let him stay but also ensured he got professional help. Instead, by not allowing him to stay, they might have contributed to him being in a worse situation. The user's wife is right to be upset because Jake's actions afterward were harmful, possibly putting his daughter at risk by leaving her alone? Wait, the user said Jake went back, put his daughter to sleep, then slept on the streets. So he didn't take the daughter with him. So the daughter was safe, but Jake was out there. Still, Jake's mental state is critical here. \n\nThe user's intention was good, but the execution might have been lacking. Maybe they should have said yes and then worked with him on a plan to address his grief and mental health. Refusing him might have pushed him into a situation where he's more at risk. Even if the user didn't want to enable avoidance, safety and immediate support are crucial in such cases. So even if the user thought they were helping, the result was negative. Therefore, they might be in the wrong because their action (or inaction) led Jake to a harmful situation, even if unintentionally.\n\nAlso, in situations where someone is struggling with depression or considering self-harm, it's important to not leave them alone. The user's refusal without providing another support option could be seen as neglecting their responsibility as a friend. So the answer is probably A, they are in the wrong.\n"
