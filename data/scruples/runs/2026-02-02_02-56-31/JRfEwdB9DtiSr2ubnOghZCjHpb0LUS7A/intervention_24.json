He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The situation is pretty heavy. The friend, Jake, is clearly struggling with depression and grief. He tried to stay at the user's house but was only allowed for his daughter, not himself. Then he went back to his house, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The user's wife is upset, but the user thinks they're helping by pushing Jake to cope.\n\nHmm, first, the user's intention was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his problems. But Jake's actions after being turned away led to him sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous. The user didn't intend for that to happen, but is there responsibility here?\n\nOn one hand, the user might think that Jake needs to face his reality, but in a crisis like this, emotional support is crucial. Turning someone away when they're in such a vulnerable state could be seen as not being there when needed. Even if the user's intention was good, the outcome was harmful. Jake might not be in a rational state to make decisions, especially with possible drug use. The user didn't offer any alternative support, just a refusal. There's a balance between helping someone move forward and providing immediate support during a crisis.\n\nAlso, Jake's daughter's safety is a factor. If the user allowed the daughter to stay but not the father, maybe the dad needed to be there for her, but he wasn't in a good state. The user's decision might have left Jake feeling isolated, pushing him to a breaking point. Even if the user didn't want to let Jake stay, offering some other form of support or connecting him with resources could have been better. \n\nIn terms of friendship, being there for each other during tough times is important. The user's refusal might have been seen as not supporting their friend when he needed it most. The friend's reaction with the glare and leaving shows the emotional impact. The user's wife calling them a massive asshole adds another layer, suggesting that their approach was harsh.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user's intention was to help, but the execution might have been flawed. The outcome was negative, and while the user didn't intend for Jake to end up on the streets, their action contributed to that. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't provide the necessary support during a crisis, even if their intention was good.\n"
