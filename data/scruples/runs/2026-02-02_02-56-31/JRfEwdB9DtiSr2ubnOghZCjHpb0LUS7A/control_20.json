He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their best friend Jake lost his wife and is struggling. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself. The friend took this as rejection and ended up sleeping on the streets. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief, but their wife is upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. Losing a spouse is a huge trauma, and the way he's handling it\u2014drinking, sleep issues\u2014suggests he's in a bad place. The author's intention was to push Jake to deal with his grief by not letting him avoid his house. But maybe they didn't consider that Jake might need more immediate support.\n\nWhen Jake showed up with his daughter, the author allowed the child but not him. That could be seen as a way to help the child while still supporting Jake's independence. But the outcome was that Jake left and slept on the streets, which is dangerous. The author didn't anticipate that Jake might take this rejection as a reason to completely withdraw. \n\nThe key points here are empathy and support. Best friends are supposed to be there for each other. By not allowing Jake to stay, the author might have failed to provide the support he needed in that moment. Even if their intention was to help Jake face reality, the result was harmful. \n\nAlso, the daughter's safety should be a priority. If Jake is struggling, maybe the author should have offered more support to both of them. The author's approach might have been too strict, not considering Jake's mental state. \n\nSo, while the author might have good intentions, their action led to a negative outcome. They should have found a way to help Jake without pushing him to the point of harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not providing the necessary support during such a critical time.\n"
