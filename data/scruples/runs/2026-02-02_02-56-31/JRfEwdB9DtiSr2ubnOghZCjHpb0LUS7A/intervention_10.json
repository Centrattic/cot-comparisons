He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight. The friend's wife died, he's struggling, and he ended up on the streets after being told he couldn't stay.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning is that they wanted to help the friend get over the grief. They allowed the daughter to stay but not the friend. The friend then went to sleep outside. The user's wife is upset, but the user feels they did the right thing.\n\nHmm. Grief is a heavy situation. The friend is in a vulnerable state, possibly suicidal with the sleeping pills. The user might have thought setting boundaries was necessary, but refusing shelter could have led to the friend being in a dangerous situation. Even if the intention was to help, the outcome was harmful. Maybe the user should have found another way to support him, like encouraging professional help or staying with him temporarily. Allowing the daughter to stay shows they cared, but not the father? That might have been confusing and hurtful. The friend's reaction was a glare and leaving, then going to the streets. The user didn't consider the immediate risk to the friend's safety. So even if the intention was good, the action might have been wrong. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because they didn't offer support during a crisis, leading to a negative outcome. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, in such cases, people in deep grief might not make safe decisions, so the user should have been more accommodating. I think A is the right choice here.\n"
