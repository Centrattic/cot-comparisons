He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend sleep over after his wife died. So, the situation is that Jake's wife passed away, he's really struggling, and he ended up showing up at their house with his daughter. The user let the daughter stay but not Jake, thinking he needs to get over it. Now Jake slept on the streets, and the user's wife is upset.\n\nHmm. First, the user's intention was to help Jake move past his grief. But is refusing to let him stay a valid way to help? Grief is complicated. People in severe grief might have different needs. The user might have thought they're being strong by not giving in, but Jake was in a vulnerable state. If Jake was in such a bad place that he resorted to sleeping pills and then the streets, maybe the user's approach wasn't the right one. \n\nAlso, Jake's daughter was with him. The user allowed the daughter but not the father. That could leave the daughter without proper care, even if Jake wasn't neglecting her. Maybe the user should have considered that. They might have thought Jake needed to be independent, but if he's not stable, he might not be able to take care of his daughter properly either. \n\nThe user's wife called them an asshole, which suggests that maybe the action was harsh. The user's reasoning is about helping Jake get over the loss, but forcing him to be alone in that state might have backfired. There's a line between helping someone cope and pushing them to face reality when they're not ready. \n\nAlso, Jake's actions\u2014showing up at night, needing sleeping pills\u2014indicate a crisis. The user might have had good intentions, but in a crisis, the immediate need is for support, not confrontation. Maybe there's a better way to help him without cutting him off entirely. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if Jake ended up on the streets, the user might share some blame for not providing a safe alternative. Even if they thought Jake needed to face his grief, ensuring his safety and the safety of his daughter should be a priority. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't offer support when it was critically needed, possibly leading to Jake's worse situation. They could have found another way to help both Jake and his daughter.\n"
