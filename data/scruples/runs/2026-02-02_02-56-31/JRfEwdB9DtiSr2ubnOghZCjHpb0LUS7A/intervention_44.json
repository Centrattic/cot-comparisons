He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their best friend Jake lost his wife a month ago, and he's really struggling. He's been drinking and sleeping a lot, and he's not handling it well. The person in question said he could sleep at their house, but only the daughter. Jake then left angry and later went home, put his daughter to sleep, and slept on the streets. The wife is upset and called the person an asshole, but the person thinks they were helping.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether not allowing the friend to stay was wrong. Let me break it down. First, Jake is in a lot of pain, which is understandable. He needs support, but the person's approach was to not let him stay overnight, maybe to push him to deal with his grief. But Jake's reaction was to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. \n\nI need to consider the intent. The person wanted to help by making Jake stay in his own house. But forcing him to handle it could have been well-meaning, but maybe not the best approach. On the other hand, Jake's actions of going to the streets after being turned away might have been impulsive or a result of his emotional state. \n\nBut the key point is whether the person was in the wrong. Even if their intention was good, if their action led to a harmful outcome, like Jake sleeping on the streets, maybe they should have been more compassionate. The daughter is with him, but if he was going to be in his house, maybe that's okay? However, if he was in a state where he might take pills again or be unstable, being left alone could be risky. \n\nWait, Jake had taken sleeping pills before. If he's in his house, maybe there's a risk of overdose or something. But the person didn't stop him from going home. They just said he couldn't stay at their house. So maybe the person's action was to prevent enabling his avoidance. However, not allowing a close friend to stay when he's in crisis might come off as uncaring. Even if the intention was to help, the execution might have been poor. \n\nAlso, the friend's daughter is involved. If the person allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, that might be confusing. The daughter's safety is important, but Jake might need support to care for her properly. If Jake is in a bad state, maybe the person should have offered to stay at Jake's place instead or found another solution. \n\nThe person's wife is upset, which suggests that the decision might not have considered the friend's mental health risks. Maybe the person should have been more flexible and tried to help rather than pushing Jake to face his grief alone. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the person's intention was to help, but the way they handled it might have been harsh. Not allowing a friend in a severe crisis to stay, especially when he's already showing signs of self-harm, could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because even though they meant well, the action could have endangered Jake's well-being. But if the person had a good reason, like not wanting to enable avoidance, maybe it's a gray area. However, the result was that Jake slept on the streets, which is dangerous. So probably A.\n"
