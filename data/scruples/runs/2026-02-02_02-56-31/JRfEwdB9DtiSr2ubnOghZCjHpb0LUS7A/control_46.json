He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his best friend stay over after his wife's death.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died, and he's struggling. He showed up unannounced at the author's house with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake. Jake then went to sleep on the streets. The author's reasoning is that he wanted to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here. Jake is in a state of severe emotional distress. He's using sleeping pills, can't handle his home environment, and is in a fragile mental state. The author's action was to let the child stay but not Jake. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks he's right because he wanted to push Jake to move on.\n\nBut wait, is pushing someone to \"get over it\" in such a situation appropriate? Grief is a process, and people need support. The author's refusal might have been harsh. Jake's actions (sleeping pills, possible suicide risk) indicate he's not in a stable place. The author's decision to let the child stay but not Jake might not have considered Jake's immediate mental health needs.\n\nAlso, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which could be dangerous. The author's intention was to help, but the outcome was negative. The question is whether the author's method was wrong. In these scenarios, empathy and support are crucial. Even if the author had good intentions, refusing shelter without alternative support might be inconsiderate, especially when the friend is vulnerable.\n\nThe author might not be \"in the wrong\" legally, but morally, it's questionable. The response could have been to set boundaries while still offering support, perhaps suggesting other options if they were unable to host Jake. The fact that Jake resorted to the streets suggests the author didn't provide adequate help. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
