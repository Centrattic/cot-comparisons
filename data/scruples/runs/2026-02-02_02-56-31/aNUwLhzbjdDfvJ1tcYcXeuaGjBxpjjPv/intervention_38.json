TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with other people following what they thought was a breakup, only to find out their ex was testing their loyalty.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the definition of the relationship. The user believed they were broken up, so they felt free to date others. However, the ex claims the breakup was a test to see if the user would be faithful. \n\nFrom the user's perspective, they acted on the assumption that the relationship was over. If the ex didn't clarify that it wasn't a breakup, the user had a reasonable belief they were single. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong if both parties have agreed to end the relationship. However, the ex's actions complicate things because they were deceptive by not being honest about their intentions. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex might argue that they were still in a relationship, even if they hadn't clearly communicated that. But if the user didn't know or was led to believe otherwise, the ex's lack of clarity could be a problem. The ex's friend mentioned it was a test, which sounds manipulative. Testing someone's loyalty without clear communication isn't healthy. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had. The ex's dishonesty is the root issue here. The user had no way of knowing the breakup was a test unless the ex communicated that it was still a relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
