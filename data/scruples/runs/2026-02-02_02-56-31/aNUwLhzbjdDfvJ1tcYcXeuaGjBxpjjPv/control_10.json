TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario. The guy breaks up with her, she starts dating others, then he admits it was a test and is angry.\n\nFirst, the guy claimed it was a breakup, so the author thought they were just friends. She then moved on by sleeping with others, which he later says was a test. The key here is consent and communication. When he said they were just friends, she believed him. So her actions were based on his initial decision to end the relationship. \n\nBut then he's upset because he was actually testing her loyalty. That's a problem. If he wanted to test her, he didn't communicate that clearly. The author's mistake was maybe acting on her emotions, but if the breakup was real, she wasn't in the wrong. However, if the breakup was a manipulation tactic, that's on him. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Legally, once a breakup is declared, the other person isn't obligated to stay faithful. But emotionally, if it was a test, then the guy's actions are questionable. The author acted based on the information given. The real issue is his deception. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because he misrepresented his intentions. Her actions were based on the breakup he claimed.\n"
