TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author was in a relationship, and the guy \"broke up\" saying they should be friends. The author thought that was the end, so they started dating others to boost their self-esteem. But then it turns out the guy was just testing the author's loyalty because he still had feelings. Now he's angry and won't talk to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author thought they were broken up, so they were allowed to date someone else. If the guy didn't communicate properly that the relationship was still ongoing in some way, maybe the author isn't at fault. But on the other hand, if the guy was still in love and thought the breakup was a test, maybe there were signs the author could have read. However, the guy never clarified that he was still in a committed state. \n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. If the guy said it was a breakup, then the author had no reason to believe they were still together. Even in the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends, they had a similar issue where Ross declared it was over, and Rachel thought it was a breakup. The guy here admitted he was testing her, which is a bit of a manipulation tactic. Testing someone's loyalty without clear communication isn't fair. \n\nAlso, the author's actions were based on the assumption that they were not in a relationship anymore. They didn't have an obligation to stay loyal if they weren't officially together. The problem here is that the guy was dishonest about his intentions. He caused confusion by breaking up and then later acting like the breakup was a test. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong because they made decisions based on the information they had. The guy's dishonesty and lack of clear communication are the main issues here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
