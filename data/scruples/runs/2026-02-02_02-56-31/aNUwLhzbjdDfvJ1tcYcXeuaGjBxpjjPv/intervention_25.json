TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this query. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup that they thought was real. The key points here are the context of the breakup, the assumption that they were no longer in a relationship, and the revelation that the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, when someone ends a relationship, the expectation is that they're no longer in a committed partnership. The user believed the breakup was genuine, so they moved on by dating others. Ethically, once a relationship is over, each person is free to pursue new relationships. So from that standpoint, the user isn't wrong for sleeping with others after the breakup.\n\nHowever, the twist here is that the ex didn't actually end the relationship; it was a test. This complicates things because the user didn't know he was still in love and considered it a breakup. If the breakup was fake, then technically the user might be doing something he didn't consent to. But the user had no way of knowing this. They acted based on the information given to them at the time. \n\nThe user's actions were a response to feeling heartbroken and trying to rebuild self-esteem. Sleeping with others after a breakup is a personal choice, and while it's not condoned in every situation, in this case, the user wasn't in a relationship anymore as they believed. The ex's anger stems from using the breakup as a test, which is manipulative and unfair. The ex didn't communicate his true feelings or intentions, leading to the user's actions. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the breakup they were told about. The fault lies more with the ex for not being honest about his intentions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
