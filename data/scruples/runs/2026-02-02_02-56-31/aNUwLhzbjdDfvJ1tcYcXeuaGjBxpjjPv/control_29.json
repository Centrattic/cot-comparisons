TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for sleeping with others after a breakup, but it turns out the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, the guy said he wanted to be friends, so the author thought they were no longer in a relationship. She got on Tinder to boost her self-esteem. From her perspective, she was single, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. But then the guy claims the breakup was a test and he's still in love. Now he's angry because she slept with others when he didn't think they were officially broken up.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. Did she know they were officially over? He said they were just friends, so she assumed it was a breakup. But if he intended it to be a test, maybe he didn't think it was a real breakup. However, he didn't clarify that. She acted based on his statement, so she might have a case. On the other hand, maybe he expected some fidelity even during the test. The problem is that the terms of their relationship weren't clear. She thought it was over, he thought it was a test. In relationships, if someone is unclear about their intentions, both parties share some responsibility. But since she made the assumption based on his statement, maybe she's not at fault. However, if he considered the breakup a test, then she wasn't supposed to move on, but that's a bit manipulative. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. But typically, if someone breaks up and says they want to be friends, the other person isn't obligated to stay faithful. However, if the breakup was a test, it's dishonest to not communicate that. But the author acted in good faith. Therefore, maybe the guy is more at fault for the test. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
