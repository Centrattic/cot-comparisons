TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she was in a relationship with a guy who said they should just be friends. She thought it was a breakup, so she started dating others on Tinder. Then she found out that the guy actually was testing her loyalty and was still in love with her, but he's mad now because she slept with other people after the \"breakup.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy claimed he wanted to be friends, and she took that as a breakup. She felt heartbroken but eventually moved on and started seeing others. She didn't know he was testing her. Now he's angry because she wasn't \"faithful\" during his test.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. When someone says they want to be friends after a breakup, does that mean they expect the other person to be celibate? That seems a bit odd, unless there's some mutual agreement on what the breakup entails. In most cases, after a breakup, people are free to date others unless there were specific terms (like a trial separation or something). But here, the guy didn't clarify that it was a test. She had no way of knowing his intentions. \n\nAlso, he was the one who initiated the breakup, so he might have had the responsibility to communicate his feelings more clearly. If he was still in love and wanted to test her, that's a bit manipulative. Testing someone's loyalty by pretending to break up without explaining the test seems underhanded. \n\nHowever, she did sleep with others after he said they were just friends. If she believed it was a breakup, then from her perspective, she wasn't cheating. But the guy's perspective is that he was still emotionally attached and wanted to see her reaction, so in his mind, she was unfaithful. \n\nThe main issue here is communication. The guy didn't make his intentions clear. If he had told her it was a test and that he was still interested, she might have acted differently. But since he didn't, she had no reason to expect that. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. She acted based on the information she had. The guy being upset is understandable if he was still emotionally invested, but his approach was manipulative. Therefore, she's not in the wrong because she didn't know it was a test and he didn't communicate properly. \n\nWait, but maybe some people would argue that even if he said breakup, if he was still in love, maybe she should have considered his feelings? But that's a stretch. People need to move on after a breakup, especially if the other person was the one to end it. \n\nAlso, the fact that he blocked her after she revealed sleeping with others shows he might have been using her. If he was testing her, maybe he's not trustworthy. \n\nSo overall, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his test properly, and she acted on the breakup he initiated.\n"
