TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with others after a breakup that turned out to be a test.\n\nFirst, the guy said he wanted to be friends after breaking up. The user thought it was a breakup and started dating others to feel better. But the guy claims it was a test to see how she'd react. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the user was wrong to move on. If the relationship was over, then she's not obligated to stay faithful. But if the guy never truly ended things and was testing her loyalty, maybe she was wrong. However, communication is key in relationships. If he didn't clarify that it wasn't a real breakup, she's not to blame for assuming it was. Plus, using a breakup as a test is manipulative. So, she probably isn't in the wrong.\n"
