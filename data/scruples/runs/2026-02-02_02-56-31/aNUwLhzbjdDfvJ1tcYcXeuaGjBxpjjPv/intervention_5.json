TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user was in a relationship and thought it ended when the guy said they should be friends. After the breakup, the user started dating others on Tinder to boost their self-esteem. Later, they found out the guy's breakup was a test to see if the user would stay loyal, and now he's mad and blocked them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The guy didn't clearly communicate his intentions. He said it was better to be friends, which typically means the relationship is over. The user acted on that assumption and moved on, which is a reasonable response to a breakup. The guy then claims he was testing the user's loyalty, which is a bit manipulative. Testing someone's loyalty after a breakup isn't healthy; relationships should be built on trust and clear communication. The user didn't know it was a test, so they acted based on the information they had. Sleeping with others after a breakup is a personal choice, but in this case, the user thought they were single. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he didn't make his intentions clear. However, the user might feel regret about not getting closure or understanding the situation better. But ultimately, the guy's actions (testing and then getting angry) are questionable. So, the user isn't in the wrong because they followed what was communicated to them at the time.\n"
