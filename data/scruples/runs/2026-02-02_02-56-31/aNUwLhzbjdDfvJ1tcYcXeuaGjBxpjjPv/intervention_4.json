TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following what they believed was a breakup.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the nature of the breakup. The guy said it was better to be friends, and the user accepted that. So, from the user's perspective, the relationship was over. If a relationship has ended, it's generally expected that the parties are free to date others unless there's some prior agreement otherwise. However, the twist here is that the guy later admitted the breakup was a test to see how the user would react.\n\nBut here's the catch: if the guy intended to test the relationship, was the breakup genuine? If he never actually meant to end things, that's a problem. The user had no way of knowing that; they acted based on his stated intentions. So, if the breakup was real, then the user isn't wrong for moving on. But if the guy's actions were manipulative, then the blame might be shared.\n\nHowever, the user went ahead and dated others, which is a natural response after a breakup. The issue arises from the guy's deception. If he didn't communicate his true intentions, it's unfair to hold the user accountable for acting in good faith. The user had every reason to believe the relationship was over and was trying to heal by moving forward.\n\nAdditionally, the guy's reaction of blocking and refusing to talk seems disproportionate. If the breakup was a test, the user didn't know that at the time. The user's actions were based on the information they had. So, in terms of fault, the user is not in the wrong. The guy's dishonesty is the root issue here. Therefore, answer B (Not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
