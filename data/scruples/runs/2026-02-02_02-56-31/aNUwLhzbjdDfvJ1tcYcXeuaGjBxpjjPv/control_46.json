TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is at fault. The situation is that the author's ex broke up with them, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author then used Tinder and slept with others, which they thought was okay because they weren't in a relationship anymore. However, the ex later revealed the breakup was a test to see if the author still loved him, and now he's angry about her sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the nature of the breakup and the author's actions post-breakup. The ex said they wanted to be just friends, but later claimed it was a test. The author, in good faith, believed the breakup was real and thus ended the relationship. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't cheating if the relationship has ended. The ex's action of using a fake breakup as a test complicates things. Legally and morally, once a relationship ends, both parties are free to date others. The author wasn't in the wrong for moving on. The ex's deception (pretending to break up) is problematic. The author didn't have an obligation to remain celibate after the breakup. Therefore, the author isn't at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
