TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they were in a relationship, the guy broke up with them, thinking they should just be friends. The person then moved on, started dating others via Tinder, and ended up sleeping with people. Now the guy says he was just testing their loyalty and is angry about the person sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The guy ended the relationship and said they should be friends. The person assumed it was a breakup, which is a common assumption. After that, they started seeing others. If the relationship was truly over, then the person isn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. However, the twist here is that the guy claims it wasn't a real breakup but a test. \n\nBut wait, how can someone test their partner's loyalty by breaking up? That seems manipulative. If he didn't communicate clearly that it was a test, then the person had no way of knowing. The key here is communication. The guy didn't clarify that he was still in love and that the breakup was a test. From the person's perspective, they were following the guy's lead. \n\nAlso, the person mentions that the guy was adamant about being friends and nothing more. If he was serious about being friends, then he shouldn't have expected them to remain celibate. But since he was testing, he's being hypocritical. The person didn't know it was a test, so they acted based on the information given. \n\nHowever, some might argue that sleeping with others immediately after a breakup could be seen as hasty, but the person did it to boost their self-esteem and move on. There's no obligation to stay single after a breakup unless in a mutual agreement. \n\nThe guy's anger seems to stem from his own manipulative behavior. He set up the situation where the person thought it was over, then got upset when they moved on. That's more about his actions than the person's. \n\nSo putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the breakup they were told about. The guy should have been honest about his intentions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
