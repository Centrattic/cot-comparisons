TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with others after a breakup that turned out to be a test. First, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe user was in a relationship where they were in love, but their partner didn't express the same feelings. The partner broke up, saying they wanted to be friends. The user, heartbroken, used Tinder and slept with others, thinking it was okay since they weren't in a relationship anymore. Then, they found out the breakup was a test to see how the user would react, and the partner is now angry because they slept with others.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user believed the relationship was over, moved on by dating others, which they thought was acceptable. However, the partner didn't actually end the relationship but was testing the user's loyalty. The user didn't know this at the time, so they acted based on the assumption that they were single.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about mutual understanding. If the partner didn't communicate their intentions clearly, then the user didn't have a reason to know the breakup was a test. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong if both parties agreed the relationship was over. However, if the partner was still emotionally attached and considered it a real breakup, that's a communication issue. The user didn't know, so they acted on the information they had. The problem here is more on the partner's side for not being clear. The user's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship had ended, so they're not at fault. But maybe there's a cultural or personal expectation about post-breakup behavior that complicates things. Still, from a logical standpoint, without clear communication, the user isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
