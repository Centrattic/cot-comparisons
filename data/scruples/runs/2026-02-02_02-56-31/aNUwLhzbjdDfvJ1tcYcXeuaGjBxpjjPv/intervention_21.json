TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup that they believed was real. The guy later said it was a test to see if she'd stay faithful.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are: she thought they were broken up, moved on by dating others, and he was actually testing her loyalty. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nThe user wants to know if she's at fault. On one hand, she acted based on the assumption that the relationship was over. On the other, he considered the breakup as a test, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. If he didn't clarify his intentions and made her believe they were broken up, that's his responsibility. But she also didn't confirm the status before moving on. However, once a breakup is mutual and communicated, the obligation to be faithful typically ends. So she might not be wrong for seeking emotional support through new relationships, especially if her self-esteem was low.\n\nBut some might argue that even if the breakup was real, engaging in new relationships quickly could be seen as disrespectful if the ex expected them to wait. However, since he was the one who initiated the breakup, that argument is weaker. Plus, the fact that he was testing her loyalty is problematic because it's a form of manipulation.\n\nI think the main issue here is his lack of clear communication and manipulation. She acted on the belief that the relationship was over. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
