TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following what they believed was a breakup. The guy they were in a relationship with later revealed that breaking up was a test to see how she'd react. Now he's angry because she didn't stay loyal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline and intentions. The user thought they were broken up and the guy was clear about being just friends. If a breakup is mutual and the relationship is over, then moving on by dating others isn't inherently wrong. However, the twist here is that the guy actually had different intentions. He didn't really break up but used it as a test. \n\nLegally and socially, once a breakup happens, each person is free to date others. The problem arises from the fact that he didn't communicate his true intentions. He led her to believe the relationship was over, which she acted upon. If that's the case, she wasn't in the wrong for moving on. But if the breakup wasn't real and he expected her to wait, then his actions are questionable. \n\nHowever, the user's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. People can't be blamed for acting on the information they have. The guy's test was deceptive, which is ethically problematic. So, in this scenario, the user might not be in the wrong because she acted based on his apparent decision to break up. The wrong might be on his part for manipulating the situation. \n\nBut some might argue that if there was any ambiguity, she should have clarified. However, in the story, he was adamant about being friends, so that's not the case here. The key issue is his deception. Therefore, the user isn't at fault.\n"
