TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, the guy broke it off saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others. The guy later claims he broke up as a test to see if she'd stay faithful, and now he's angry because she slept with others even though they weren't official anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong. The key points are: the guy ended the relationship, they were supposed to be friends. The author thought they were single and moved on, which led to her sleeping with others. The guy's friend says the breakup was a test, but he never communicated that to her. \n\nThe guy's actions here are a bit iffy. If he broke up with her without clarifying it was a test, and then later claims he wanted to see her reaction, that's on him. The author made a decision based on the information she had at the time. She thought they were no longer together, so she saw no obligation to stay faithful. Even though she was still in love, her actions were based on the assumption that they were over. \n\nThe problem arises from the guy's lack of communication. He didn't make it clear that he was still considering the relationship ongoing. The author isn't in the wrong because she acted in good faith based on his initial breakup statement. His anger stems from a hidden test he never communicated properly, which makes his reaction unfair. Therefore, the author isn't at fault.\n"
