TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy (the author) was in a relationship, the other person (let's call him the guy) broke up with him, saying they should be friends. The author then starts sleeping with other people on Tinder to boost self-esteem. Then the author mentions this, and the guy gets furious because he had actually broken up as a test to see what the author would do, and he's mad they slept with others.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The guy ended the relationship, called it a break up, and wanted to be friends. The author, after the break up, started dating others because they were no longer in a relationship. The key question here is whether the author was in the wrong for doing so.\n\nBut then there's the twist: the guy said the break up was a test to see if the author would stay faithful. So he didn't actually end the relationship but wanted to test their loyalty. If that's true, then technically the author wasn't in a relationship anymore at the time they started seeing others. However, if the break up was a test and the guy never communicated that, then the author had no way of knowing. The guy's friend later told the author that the break up was a test, implying that the author was supposed to know he was being tested. But how could the author know that? The guy never indicated that the break up was a test. The author thought it was real.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they were single after the break up and thus had the right to date others. The guy, on the other hand, set up a scenario where he pretended to break up to test the author's reaction. Then he got angry when the author did what he expected (since they were no longer in a relationship). The guy's actions were deceptive. He lied about the break up being real, and then judged the author for acting on that lie.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the guy's actions were manipulative. The author had no way of knowing it was a test, so sleeping with others wasn't wrong in that context. The real issue is the guy's dishonesty. The author wasn't in the wrong for moving on after a break up; it's a natural thing to do. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
