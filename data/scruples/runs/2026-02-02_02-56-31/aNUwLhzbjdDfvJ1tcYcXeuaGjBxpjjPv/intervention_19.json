TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup that turned out to be a test. \n\nFirst, the guy said they should be friends, and he was adamant about it. The user believed they were broken up, so they used Tinder and slept with others. But the guy was actually testing her loyalty. Now he's angry because he thought they were still together.\n\nWait, but if he considered the breakup a test and they were still in a relationship, then technically, she was cheating. Because the breakup wasn't real. So maybe she is in the wrong because she didn't know the truth, but he didn't communicate that properly. However, the user thought they were friends, so maybe she wasn't aware of the actual status. \n\nHmm, but the user's responsibility is to follow the breakup as he declared. If he said they were just friends, she had no reason to assume they were still a couple. The fact that he was testing her by breaking up is on him. So she might not be in the wrong because she acted based on his initial declaration. The problem is his lack of communication and honesty. \n\nBut if the breakup wasn't real, then technically she was cheating. However, since he didn't clarify, it's a bit of a gray area. The user believed they were separated, so she's not at fault. The guy is responsible for not being clear. So answer B: No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
