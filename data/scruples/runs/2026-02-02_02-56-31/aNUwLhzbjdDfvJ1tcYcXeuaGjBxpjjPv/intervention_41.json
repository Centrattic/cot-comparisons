TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if they did the wrong thing by sleeping with others after their partner broke up with them, only to find out the break-up was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The user was in a relationship where they were in love, but the partner didn't reciprocate the same level of commitment. The partner then \"broke up,\" saying they wanted to be friends. The user, heartbroken, started dating others as a way to cope. Then the partner later revealed it was a test, and they're now angry about the user's actions.\n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) The partner initiated a breakup and suggested being friends. 2) The user, believing it was over, moved on and had relationships. 3) The original partner didn't disclose this was a test until after the user had slept with others. 4) The user's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, when someone initiates a breakup and there's no indication of it being a test, the other person is justified in moving on. However, the partner's actions of setting up a test without clear communication could be problematic. Testing someone's loyalty without honesty might be seen as manipulative. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of boundaries. Even if the relationship was over, if there was an unspoken expectation of exclusivity during the transition period, the user might have breached that. However, if the partner clearly stated they were just friends and no longer in a relationship, then the user had no obligation to be faithful.\n\nAnother angle is the partner's responsibility to communicate their intentions. If they wanted to test the user, they should have been upfront. By not doing so, they set up a scenario where the user made decisions based on false premises.\n\nSo, in terms of fault, the user acted based on the information they had. The partner's deception might be the crux here. However, if there were lingering expectations or if the user was in a state of emotional vulnerability, some might argue the user should have been more cautious. But given the information, the user had every reason to believe the relationship was over.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the partner's stated intentions. The partner's test was not communicated, making their anger unjustified. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
