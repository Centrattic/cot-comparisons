  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people after a breakup, only to find out the breakup was a test by their ex.\n\nFirst, the ex said they were just friends and the user thought it was a breakup. The user got back on Tinder and slept with others because they thought they were no longer in a relationship. The ex later said it was just a test and they were still in love, then got mad when the user had sex with others.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the breakup was genuine or a test. If the ex had not actually ended the relationship but was testing the user, then the user might not be in the wrong. But how could the user know? The ex clearly said it was over and wanted to be friends. The user had no reason to believe it was a test. Acting on the information given, the user tried to move on, which is a normal reaction.\n\nBut the ex is now angry because the user had sex with others when they thought they were single. However, since the ex lied about the breakup being a test, the user couldn't be expected to know. The user wasn't cheating during the relationship; they acted post-breakup. The ex's actions are deceptive. \n\nSo, considering the user's perspective, they were acting on the ex's stated intention to be friends, not in a relationship. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. The ex made the situation complicated by pretending to break up. So the answer is B.\n"
