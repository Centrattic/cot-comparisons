TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they were in a relationship, the guy broke up with them, they thought they were over, and then they started seeing other people. But later, it turns out the guy said it was a breakup as a test to see how they'd react. Now he's angry because they slept with others, even though they thought they were just friends.\n\nFirst, from the perspective of the person asking: they believed the relationship was over. When someone breaks up with you, it's generally expected that the relationship has ended. So, moving on and dating others seems reasonable. They even mention they were heartbroken and trying to boost their self-esteem. So, they acted based on the information they had at the time.\n\nThen, the twist is that the guy's breakup was a test. But that seems manipulative. If he was in love and just wanted to test their loyalty, that's not a healthy approach. Relationships built on deceit or tests can be problematic. However, the person didn't know this was a test. They made decisions based on the breakup being real.\n\nThe question is whether they're at fault. If the breakup was genuine, then no. But since the guy later revealed it was a test, does that change things? Well, the person acted in good faith. They didn't know about the test. They thought they were free to date others. So, ethically, they're not at fault because they didn't have the information that the breakup was a test. The problem lies with the guy for using a test that manipulated the situation.\n\nAlso, the guy blocking them after the fact seems like a reactive and possibly immature response. The person isn't obligated to stay single after a breakup, even if there's lingering feelings. So, overall, the person isn't in the wrong here. The fault lies more with the guy for creating a false breakup scenario.\n"
