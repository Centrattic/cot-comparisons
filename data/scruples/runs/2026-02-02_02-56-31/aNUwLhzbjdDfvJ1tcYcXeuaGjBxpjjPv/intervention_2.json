TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following what they thought was a breakup. The guy they were in a relationship with decided to end it, saying they should just be friends. The user, heartbroken and trying to rebuild their self-esteem, used Tinder and had sex with others. Now, the guy is angry because he actually meant the breakup as a test to see if she'd stay faithful, and he's furious.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The user believed the relationship was over, so from her perspective, she wasn't cheating. She was trying to move on and deal with her emotions. On the other hand, the guy didn't clearly communicate his intentions and considered the breakup as a test, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. If the relationship wasn't officially ended, but just placed on hold as a test, then technically they were still in a relationship. However, the user had no way of knowing that unless he communicated it clearly. The problem here is that he didn't set clear boundaries. If he was still in love and wanted to test her loyalty, that's a red flag. \n\nBut the user's actions might be seen as okay because she acted based on the breakup he declared. She had no reason to believe it was a test. So, she wasn't in the wrong. However, from the guy's perspective, if he still considered them in a relationship, then she did something wrong. But since he didn't clarify that, it's more his fault for the confusion. \n\nIn relationships, clear communication is essential. If he didn't make it clear that they were still together, then the responsibility for the misunderstanding lies with him. The user acted based on the information she had. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
