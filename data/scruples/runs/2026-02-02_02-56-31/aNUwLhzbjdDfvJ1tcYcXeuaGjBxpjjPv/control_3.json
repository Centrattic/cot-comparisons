TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is like the Ross and Rachel one, which I remember is about a breakup and then getting back together. The author was in a relationship with a guy who broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. Now, he says the breakup was a test to see if she would be faithful, and he's angry she moved on.\n\nFirst, the guy broke up with her and said they could only be friends. That's a clear breakup, right? So if he said they were over, then she's not in a relationship anymore. If she's not in a relationship, then she's free to date and have sex with others. But then he claims it was a test. That's confusing because a breakup is supposed to be final unless he communicated differently. Did he make that clear? The author says he was adamant they were just friends, so maybe he didn't tell her it was a test. If he didn't, then she had no reason to know it was a test, so she's not in the wrong for moving on. \n\nBut some might say that maybe she should have asked for more clarity before moving on. However, the guy didn't give her any indication that he was lying or testing her. His actions (breaking up and continuing to talk) might have been ambiguous, but the responsibility is on him to communicate clearly. If he wanted a closed test, he should have made that clear. By not doing so, he's the one being deceptive. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning makes sense. After a breakup, she's trying to rebuild her self-esteem and move on. It's her choice to date others, and the guy's anger seems misplaced, especially since he was the one who ended the relationship. The fact that his friend told her about the test adds another layer of confusion. Maybe he was trying to see if she'd still be loyal even though he was pretending to break up. That's manipulative, though. She can't be blamed for taking his word as final. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's actions were deceptive, and she acted based on the information she had. The answer should be B.\n"
