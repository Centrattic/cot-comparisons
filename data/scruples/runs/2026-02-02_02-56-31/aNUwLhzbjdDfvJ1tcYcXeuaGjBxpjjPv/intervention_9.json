  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following what they thought was a breakup. The guy they were in a relationship with ended things, saying they should just be friends. The user then started dating others on Tinder to boost their self-esteem. But the guy later admitted that breaking up was a test to see how the user would react, and now he's angry because they slept with others, even though they weren't in a relationship at the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user believed the relationship was over, so they ended it and moved on. They didn't have any obligation to stay faithful once the relationship ended. The guy, however, claimed it was a test. But from the user's perspective, there was no communication that it was a test. They were acting based on the assumption that the breakup was real.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the guy wanted to test the user, that's on him. But the user didn't know it was a test and acted accordingly. The user's actions were based on the information they had at the time. The guy's anger might stem from feeling betrayed, but if they were no longer in a relationship, the user's actions weren't cheating. However, the user might be in the wrong if there were unspoken expectations or if they were still in a de facto relationship. But since the guy said they were just friends, the user had every right to move on. The real issue here is the lack of clear communication from the guy. He shouldn't have used a breakup as a test without being honest. So, the user probably isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
