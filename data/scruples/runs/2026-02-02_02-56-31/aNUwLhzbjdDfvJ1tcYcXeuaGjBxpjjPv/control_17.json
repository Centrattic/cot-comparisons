TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with the author, claiming it was better to be friends. After the breakup, the author started dating others on Tinder to boost her self-esteem. Then she found out the guy had broken up with her as a test to see how she would react, and now he's angry about her sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. When someone ends a relationship, the usual assumption is that they're no longer exclusive. The author thought they were broken up and acted accordingly. But the guy later admitted he was testing her, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nThe key points here are: the guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test. He said it was to be friends, so the author had no reason to believe he was still considering them a couple. Sleeping with others after a breakup is generally not considered cheating if there's mutual agreement to end the relationship. However, if one party is testing, but hasn't communicated that, it's a problem.\n\nThe author did the natural thing after a breakup: moving on. The guy's actions, though, were deceptive. He pretended to end the relationship but was actually testing her loyalty. That's a bit underhanded. So, the author isn't at fault because she acted based on his stated intentions. The guy's anger comes from his own manipulative behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
