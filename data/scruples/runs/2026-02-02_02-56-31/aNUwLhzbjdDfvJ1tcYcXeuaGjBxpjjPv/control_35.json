TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy said they should just be friends, so the author started dating others on Tinder. Then the guy gets mad when she tells him about the Tinder dates, and it turns out he was testing her loyalty.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the relationship status. The guy called it off, saying they should be friends. The author thought it was a breakup and moved on by dating others. But the guy later says it was a test to see if she'd stay faithful. So, the key point here is whether the author had a valid reason to believe the relationship was over.\n\nIn most cases, if someone explicitly says they want to just be friends, the other person isn't obligated to remain faithful. It's a breakup, so moving on is normal. However, if the guy's intention was a test, that's a bit manipulative. The author wasn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. The guy's anger here is because he wanted her to stay single even after a breakup, which is a bit unfair.\n\nBut then again, there's the emotional aspect. The author was still in love, but she thought the relationship was over. She acted on her own to cope with the breakup. The guy's test is a bit underhanded because he didn't clarify his true feelings. However, some might argue that she could have waited longer before starting to date others, but that's a stretch. \n\nConsidering all this, the author wasn't in the wrong because the relationship was supposedly over. The guy's test is more problematic because he didn't communicate his intentions clearly. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
