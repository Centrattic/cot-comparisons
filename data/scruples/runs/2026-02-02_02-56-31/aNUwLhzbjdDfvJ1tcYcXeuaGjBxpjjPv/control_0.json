TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with her, but she thought they were just friends and slept with other people. Then he got angry because he said it was a test and wanted to see how she would react. \n\nFirst, the guy claimed they were broken up, so from her perspective, there was no relationship anymore. She started dating others to help with her self-esteem after the breakup. But he later said the breakup was a test to see if she would stay loyal. That's a bit confusing because if he broke up with her, why would he expect her to stay faithful? That doesn't make sense. \n\nHe didn't clarify his intentions when he said they should be friends. If he was in love with her and wanted to test her, he should have been honest from the start. By breaking up and then expecting her to stay away from others is a bit manipulative. Also, she didn't know it was a test, so she acted based on the breakup he stated. \n\nShe thought she was free to move on, which is a natural response after a breakup. He might be holding onto the idea that their relationship was still valid even after he ended it. That's on him for not being clear. His reaction seems harsh because once a relationship is broken up, the expectation of fidelity usually ends. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or social norm aspect here. Some people might think that even after a breakup, if the other person is still in love, you should wait. But that's not a universal rule. The key here is that he didn't communicate his true intentions. If he wanted to test her, he should have been upfront. \n\nIn relationships, both parties have responsibilities to communicate. If he ended the relationship, she's under no obligation to stay single. His \"test\" was a secret motive, which isn't fair. So the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the information she had, which was that the relationship was over. The guy's anger stems from a hidden agenda that he didn't disclose, making him at least partially responsible.\n"
