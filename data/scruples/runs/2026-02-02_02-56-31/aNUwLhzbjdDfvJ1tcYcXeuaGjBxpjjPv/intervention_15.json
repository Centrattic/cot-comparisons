  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup, but it turns out the breakup was a test. So, the guy ended the relationship, she moved on by dating others, and then he gets upset because he was still in love and thought she'd be faithful during his test.\n\nFirst, from her perspective, she believed they were broken up. If the guy didn't make that clear and instead said it was better to be friends, she might have thought it was over. She's using Tinder and sleeping with others to cope, which she thought was acceptable since they weren't together. But then she finds out he was still in love and testing her loyalty.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. If the guy never clearly stated the relationship was over and instead said they should be friends, but then later reveals he wasn't done, that's a problem. She acted based on the information she had. However, sleeping with others immediately after a breakup might be seen as moving on too quickly, but if they were truly broken up, she's not in the wrong for not waiting forever.\n\nOn the other hand, if the guy didn't communicate properly and then expected her to remain exclusive, that's his fault. He set up a confusing situation by not being clear about his intentions. His anger seems misplaced because she didn't know the breakup was a test. His actions led to her making decisions based on the assumption that the relationship was over.\n\nSo, considering both sides, she's not in the wrong because she acted on the information provided. The blame lies more with the guy for not being clear and using a test that put her in a situation where she couldn't know his true feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
