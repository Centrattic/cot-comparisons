  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup, only to find out their ex wanted to test them.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy broke up, saying it's better as friends. The user, heartbroken, starts dating others on Tinder. Then, the ex reveals the breakup was a test. Now he's angry because they moved on. The user is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, from the user's perspective, they believed the relationship was over. When a relationship ends, people usually assume they're free to start new ones. The user's actions seem like a normal response to moving on. But the ex's intention was to test loyalty, which is a bit manipulative. The user didn't know the breakup was a test, so they acted on their understanding of the situation.\n\nThe key here is the assumption of a breakup. If the user genuinely thought they were no longer in a relationship, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. But the ex's friend mentioned the breakup was a test. So, was the breakup real? If the ex intended to keep the relationship going by testing loyalty, that's a problem. But since the user didn't know, they might not be at fault.\n\nAnother angle: The ex's actions were deceptive. Testing a partner's loyalty by pretending to break up is manipulative. The user's mistake was trusting the breakup was final. However, when someone ends a relationship, the other person is within their rights to move on. The ex's anger stems from his own deceptive actions.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user might not be at fault because they acted on the information given. The ex's behavior is questionable for setting up a test without transparency. So, the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong. But some might argue that if the user still had feelings, maybe they should've communicated better. However, the user tried to move on, which is understandable after a breakup.\n\nIn summary, since the user acted on the belief that the relationship had ended and the ex's actions were deceptive, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
