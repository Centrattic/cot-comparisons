TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, the partner broke up, but later revealed it was a test. The author then started seeing others and the ex got mad.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy ended the relationship, told her to be friends. She moved on, used Tinder, slept with others. Then he admitted the breakup was a test, and he's angry about her sleeping with others.\n\nThe main question is whether she was wrong. So, from her perspective, she thought they were broken up. Once they're not in a relationship, sleeping with others isn't cheating. But he considered it a test, so maybe he didn't actually want to break up. That complicates things.\n\nBut the test part is a red flag. He broke up with her, which is a clear action, but then later says it was a test. That's manipulative. He set boundaries and then changed them. So her moving on after he initiated the breakup and said they were just friends is understandable. She had no obligation to stay single if they weren't in a relationship anymore.\n\nHowever, maybe there's an emotional aspect. She was still in love with him, but he didn't return those feelings. She tried to boost her self-esteem by dating others. If they were truly broken up, her actions are her own. The problem is that he used the test as a way to control her actions, but she didn't know that at the time.\n\nSo is she in the wrong? If the breakup was genuine, then no. But since he later said it was a test, maybe he expected her to stay faithful even after a fake breakup. But ethically, once a relationship is ended, unless there are mutual boundaries (like an open relationship), sleeping with others isn't wrong. He shouldn't have broken up to test her. That's not a healthy dynamic.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's behavior is questionable. She acted based on the information she had at the time. Answer B.\n"
