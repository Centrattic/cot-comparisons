TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where one person breaks up, the other starts dating someone else, and then the first person comes back. \n\nSo, the author was in a relationship with a guy who broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but agreed. Then, to boost her self-esteem, she started using Tinder and slept with others. The guy later admitted the breakup was a test to see if she would stay loyal, and he's now angry and blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong. The key points here are: the guy said it was a breakup, so she assumed they were no longer in a relationship. If he told her to be friends, then technically, from her perspective, they were broken up. In a breakup, it's generally acceptable for each person to move on, so sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong, especially if the relationship is over.\n\nHowever, the twist is that the guy didn't actually mean to break up; he was testing her. But from the author's point of view, she had no reason to believe the breakup wasn't real. If he didn't communicate that it was a test, then she acted based on the information she had. It's his fault for not being clear. \n\nThe ethical question here is about trust and communication. The guy's behavior is deceptive. If he wanted to test her, that's manipulative and not a healthy approach. The author, on the other hand, made decisions based on the breakup, which she believed was real. So, she's not in the wrong because she acted on his stated intention. The issue lies with the guy's dishonesty and lack of communication. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She was acting under the assumption that the relationship was over, which he led her to believe. The problem is his deception, not her actions following his stated breakup.\n"
