TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with new people after their partner ended the relationship, which turned out to be a test. \n\nFirst, the guy broke up, saying they should just be friends. The user, heartbroken, started dating others to boost self-esteem. But then the guy reveals the breakup was a test to see their reaction. Now he's angry about the new relationships.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the user do something wrong? Well, if a breakup is mutual or agreed upon, then moving on is normal. But here, the guy didn't actually end the relationship; it was a test. From the user's perspective, they believed it was over. They acted based on that belief. However, they might have violated his unspoken expectation that a breakup test shouldn't be taken seriously. \n\nBut the main issue is communication. The user thought they were free to date again, while the guy didn't communicate his intentions clearly. The user isn't at fault for acting on the information they had. The real problem is the guy's deceptive behavior in making it a test without being clear. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
