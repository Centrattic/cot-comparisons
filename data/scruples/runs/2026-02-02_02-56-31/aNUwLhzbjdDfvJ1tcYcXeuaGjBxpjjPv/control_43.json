TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup that turned out to be a test.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's partner said they wanted to be just friends, and the author believed it was a breakup. They then moved on by dating others on Tinder. Later, they learned that the partner had intended this as a test to see how the author would react. The partner is now angry and has blocked them.\n\nThe key points here are the context and the expectations. When a relationship ends, even if it's not formalized, people often have different understandings. The author thought they were separated and thus not in a relationship anymore. The partner, however, considered it a test and expected fidelity during that time. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if they genuinely believed they were no longer in a relationship, then sleeping with others might be seen as reasonable. Relationships often carry an unspoken expectation of exclusivity, but once it's supposedly over, that expectation dissolves. The twist here is that the partner was lying about the breakup for their own reasons. The author acted based on the information they had at the time.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have communicated more or considered that the partner might not be entirely truthful. But in most cases, people rely on what their partner says. The problem here is the partner's deception. The author wasn't in the wrong for acting on what they believed was a genuine breakup. The real issue is the partner's lack of honesty in their intentions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information provided. The partner's actions (lying about the breakup) are the root of the problem. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
