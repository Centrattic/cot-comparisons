TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, she started dating others, and he got mad later because he actually broke up as a test. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The guy said they're just friends, and he was adamant about it. The author, after being heartbroken, started seeing others. She thought it was okay since they weren't a couple anymore. But then he reveals that the breakup was a test, meaning he still wanted to be with her.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and clear communication. When a breakup happens, unless there's some agreement that it's conditional (like a test), the person is free to move on. But the guy didn't communicate that the breakup was a test. So from her perspective, he ended the relationship, and she's within her rights to date others. However, he later claims he never truly ended things, which complicates things.\n\nBut wait, if he was testing her, he might be at fault for not being honest. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. She believed they were over, so sleeping with others isn't cheating because they weren't in a relationship anymore. However, if he had communicated that he was testing her, then her actions might be different. But since he didn't, she isn't in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if he was still in love, he shouldn't have broken up in the first place. But the key is the communication. The author did what she thought was right based on his initial breakup. The test part was a secret he didn't share, so he's the one being deceptive here. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she acted under the assumption that the relationship was over, and he misrepresented his intentions. His anger stems from his own hidden test, not her actions directly.\n"
