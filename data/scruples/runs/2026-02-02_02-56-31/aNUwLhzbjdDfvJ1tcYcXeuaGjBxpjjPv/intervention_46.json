TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person's ex broke up with them and said they wanted to be friends. The person then started dating others and sleeping with people on Tinder. Later, they found out that the ex's breakup was actually a test to see their reaction, and the ex is now angry about them sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the breakup. The ex said it was better to be friends, which typically means the relationship is over. If a breakup is mutual and both parties agree to be friends, then the person might not be in the wrong for moving on. But there's a twist here: the ex claims it was a test. That complicates things because the person didn't know it was a test at the time. The person acted in good faith, assuming the breakup was real.\n\nBut wait, the ex was still in love and wanted to see the person's reaction. So the ex essentially created a situation where the person thought the relationship was over but it wasn't. The person then moved on, thinking they were free to do so. From the person's perspective, they're not in the wrong because they were following the ex's lead. However, the ex's actions\u2014lying about the breakup as a test\u2014could be seen as manipulative or deceitful. \n\nBut the question is whether the person (the one who slept with others) is in the wrong. If the breakup was genuine, then no, they're not wrong. But if the breakup was a test, then maybe the ex expected a certain response. However, the person had no way of knowing it was a test. The ex's actions led them to believe the relationship was over. So in that case, the person acted based on the information they had. \n\nThe ex is now angry because the person moved on, but the ex's initial move to create the test was the root of the problem. The person's actions were a response to being told the relationship was over. So, in terms of right and wrong, the ex's test is the issue here. The person isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the breakup they were told. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of emotional maturity. The person went on Tinder immediately after a breakup, which some might see as impulsive. But the key here is the ex's deception. The person isn't at fault for following through with the breakup they were given. So overall, the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
