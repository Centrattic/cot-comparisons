TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author thought their boyfriend broke up with them, so they started seeing other people. Later, they found out that the breakup was a test, and now the guy is angry because they slept with others when they weren't officially together. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author believed the relationship was over, so they moved on by sleeping with others. The boyfriend later claims he broke up as a test to see if she'd stay faithful. Now he's upset because she didn't, and she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nFrom a typical relationship ethics perspective, cheating usually involves being unfaithful while in a committed relationship. But in this case, the author thought the relationship was over. So if the breakup was real, then she's not cheating. However, the twist is that he said it was a test. That complicates things because if he didn't actually intend to end the relationship, then she might have been in a situation where the boundaries were unclear.\n\nBut here's the thing: if someone ends a relationship, even if it's a lie, the person receiving the breakup has a right to believe it's over. The author acted based on his statement. If he's now holding her accountable for sleeping with others after a breakup he initiated, even if it was a test, that could be seen as unfair. Because he set the premise that they were no longer a couple. She had every reason to believe they were no longer together, so moving on isn't her fault. Plus, the idea of a \"test\" in relationships is often considered manipulative because it puts the other person in a position where they can't win. If she had stayed faithful during the test, maybe he'd be happy, but if she moved on, he gets upset. That seems like a setup for betrayal.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup that he presented as real. His actions of breaking up and then being angry at her for moving on is where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
