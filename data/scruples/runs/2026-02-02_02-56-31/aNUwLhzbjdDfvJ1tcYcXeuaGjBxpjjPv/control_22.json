TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup that turned out to be a test.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a relationship where the guy broke up with her, wanting to be friends. She was heartbroken, started dating others via Tinder, and now the guy is mad because he claims the breakup was a test to see if she would stay faithful. He ended up blocking her after she revealed she slept with others.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy initiated the breakup and said they should be friends. The author believed it was over and moved on by dating others. However, he later admits the breakup was a test to see if she would remain faithful, which she didn't, leading to his anger.\n\nNow, from a relationship ethics standpoint, when someone breaks up with you, you're not in a committed relationship anymore. The author thought it was over, so she had the right to date others. The guy's actions here are questionable because he used a breakup as a test without being honest about his intentions. That's manipulative because he never clearly communicated that he wanted to test her fidelity. He broke up with her, which is a clear end to the relationship, and then got upset when she moved on. \n\nBut some might argue that the guy was trying to save the relationship by testing her loyalty. However, the problem is that he didn't own up to this test until after she had already moved on. That's unfair because it's not his place to set up a scenario where he expects her to wait indefinitely without any communication about his true feelings or intentions.\n\nAlso, the author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. She had no obligation to stay faithful once it was broken off. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he didn't communicate his true feelings during the breakup. It's a situation where he manipulated the situation without being upfront, which is a red flag.\n\nIn terms of accountability: The author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had at the time. The guy is the one who created a confusing scenario and then got angry when she behaved in a way that was reasonable given the circumstances. The key issue is communication and honesty. The guy didn't clearly state his intentions, leading to the author making decisions based on the breakup being real.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
