TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following what they thought was a breakup. The guy said it was better to be friends, but later revealed it was a test to see if she'd stay loyal. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. She believed they were broken up. When someone ends a relationship, even if they're not clear about the terms, the assumption is that they're not in a committed relationship anymore. So, from her perspective, she wasn't in a relationship and thus had no obligation to be faithful. She turned to Tinder to boost her self-esteem, which is a common way people deal with breakups. However, it didn't help her get over him, which adds emotional complexity.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy claims it was a test. That's a pretty manipulative move. If he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, that's not a legitimate reason to end the relationship. Testing someone's loyalty by pretending to break up is deceptive. But the key here is that he didn't clarify the situation. If he didn't communicate that it was a test, she had no way of knowing. So her actions were based on the information she had at the time.\n\nNow, the question is whether she was in the wrong. If they were truly broken up, then she wasn't cheating. Cheating typically involves being in a committed relationship and being unfaithful. Since he said they were just friends, she wasn't bound by the same rules. However, if he considered them still in a relationship for the purpose of the test, that's a problem. But since he didn't communicate that, she had no reason to know. \n\nAnother angle: trust and communication. The guy's actions (the test) are questionable. He should have been honest about his feelings instead of using a breakup as a test. Her sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong if she believed they were no longer a couple. \n\nSo, putting it all together, she's not in the wrong because she acted based on his stated intention to be friends. His deception is the real issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
