TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're at fault for sleeping with others after a breakup, only to find out the breakup was a test. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where Ross's breakup with Rachel was a test. The key point here is consent. When a relationship ends, unless there's some agreement otherwise, both parties are free to date others. The user thought they were broken up, so sleeping with others isn't inherently wrong. The guy said it was a test, but he didn't communicate that clearly. He broke up with her, so she had no reason to know it was a test. It's his fault for not being honest from the start. However, the user did proceed to sleep with others, which might be seen as a bit hasty if they were still in love. But given the breakup was his decision, she's not in the wrong. The issue is his lack of communication and using a test without clear boundaries. So the answer would be B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
