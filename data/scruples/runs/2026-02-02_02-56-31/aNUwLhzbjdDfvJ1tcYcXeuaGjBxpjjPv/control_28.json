TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with a guy. He decided to break up, saying they should just be friends. The author was heartbroken but eventually tried to accept it. To help with self-esteem, she started dating and sleeping with others on Tinder, thinking it was okay because they weren't a couple anymore. Then, when she mentioned it, he blocked her. Later, she found out he was just testing her by breaking up and was still in love. Now he's angry because she slept with others during the time he considered them not being a couple.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy said it was a breakup, but it was actually a test. The author believed it was over, so she moved on. But the guy never really ended the relationship; he just wanted to see if she'd stay faithful. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From her perspective, she thought the relationship was over, so she had no obligation to remain faithful. But from his side, maybe he considered them still in a relationship even after breaking up, which is confusing because breakups typically end the relationship. \n\nBut then again, if someone breaks up with you, even if it's a test, you're supposed to respect their decision. However, the guy's actions were deceptive. He didn't communicate clearly that he wasn't actually ending the relationship. The author made a decision based on the information she had. But did she have a responsibility to know it was a test? Probably not, since he presented it as a real breakup. \n\nSo, the author's actions were based on her belief that they were no longer in a relationship. She acted to boost her self-esteem after a breakup, which is a common coping mechanism. However, the guy's anger seems misplaced because he never actually ended the relationship in a clear way. His test was a manipulative move, which is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and clear communication are key. If the guy wanted to see how she'd react without breaking up, he should have been honest. But since he presented it as a breakup, the author isn't at fault. She acted on the information given to her. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
