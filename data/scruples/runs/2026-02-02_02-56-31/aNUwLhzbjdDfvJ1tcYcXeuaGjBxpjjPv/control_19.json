TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with her, she thought they were done, and then she started seeing others on Tinder. But then she found out that the breakup was a test, and he's mad because she slept with other people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. She believed they were no longer in a relationship after he said they should just be friends. She got on Tinder to boost her self-esteem, which is something people do after a breakup. She thought she wasn't obligated to stay loyal since they weren't together anymore. That makes sense from her point of view.\n\nNow, the guy's side is that he broke up with her as a test. That seems manipulative. If he was still in love and wanted to see how she'd react, that's not a healthy approach. People don't typically break up with someone just to test their loyalty. It's more about his intentions being unclear or deceptive.\n\nThe key point here is consent and mutual understanding. When he told her to be friends, she took it as the end of the relationship. If he didn't clarify that it wasn't a real breakup, then she acted on the information given. However, if he intended to keep the door open for a test, that's his fault for not being honest. But in relationships, when someone says they want to be friends, the other person usually assumes the relationship has ended.\n\nAnother angle is that she moved on by dating others, which is a natural response after a breakup. The fact that he was upset about her sleeping with others when they weren't together might be his jealousy, but if he wasn't clear about his intentions, it's not entirely her fault. However, some might argue that even if they were broken up, if there was still an emotional connection, she might have been too quick to move on, but that's subjective.\n\nAlso, the idea that he did a \"test\" is questionable. Using a breakup as a test to see if someone is faithful is manipulative and not a healthy way to approach relationships. His anger seems misplaced if he was the one who initiated the breakup and then expected her to wait for him.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, once a relationship is over, people generally have the right to move on and date others. The fact that she did so based on his initial breakup message makes it hard to blame her. However, if there was any ambiguity in their communication, that's where the problem lies.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author thought they were broken up and acted accordingly. The guy being mad because it was a test is his own fault for not being honest. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
