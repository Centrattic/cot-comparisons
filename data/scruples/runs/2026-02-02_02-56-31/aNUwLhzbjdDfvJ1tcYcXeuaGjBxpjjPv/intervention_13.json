TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup that turned out to be a test.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy ended the relationship, said they should be friends. The user, heartbroken, used Tinder and slept with others, thinking the relationship was over. Later found out the breakup was a test; he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nSo, the user's argument is they thought the relationship was over, so they weren't cheating. The guy claims it was a test, implying he never intended to end it. But the user acted under the belief the relationship had ended. \n\nFrom a typical perspective, if a partner declares a breakup, the other person isn't at fault for moving on. However, if the breakup was a test, then the user might be in the wrong because the relationship technically continued. But the user had no way of knowing it was a test. The guy's actions were deceptive. \n\nThe user's actions were based on the information they had. The guy's dishonesty is problematic. So, in terms of fault, the user isn't wrong for acting on what they believed to be a real breakup. The issue lies with the guy for not being honest and setting clear boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
