TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario, where one person breaks up and the other moves on, but there's some twist.\n\nFirst, the guy said they were just friends after breaking up. The user thought the relationship was over, so they started dating others. The guy later says the break-up was a test to see if she'd stay loyal. Now he's angry she moved on.\n\nHmm. The key here is clarity in communication. If the guy didn't make it clear that the break-up was a test, she had every right to assume it was over. He's being dishonest by using a fake break-up to test her. She acted based on his initial statement. But wait, did he ever confirm it was over? She thought they were not a couple anymore, so sleeping with others isn't cheating if they're not in a relationship. However, if he believed they were still in a relationship, then she might be at fault. But since he initiated the break-up, even if it was a test, she had no way of knowing. So she's not in the wrong. His actions are deceptive. Answer B.\n"
