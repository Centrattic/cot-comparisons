TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with her, she thought they were over, and then she started seeing other people. But then he told her it was a test to see how she'd react, and now he's upset she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The guy said they were just friends, so she assumed the relationship was over. She used Tinder and slept with others, which she thought was okay because they weren't together anymore. But the guy claims it was a test, meaning he didn't actually break up with her. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the breakup was genuine. If he truly ended the relationship and she was following his lead, then she's not at fault for moving on. However, if he didn't actually break up and was just testing her, then maybe she did something wrong by sleeping with others. But the problem is that he communicated the breakup as being final, so she had no reason to know it was a test. \n\nAlso, the guy is now angry because she didn't wait for him. But if he didn't clarify that it was a test, then he can't blame her for moving on. People in relationships often break up and both move on, so she acting in that way isn't wrong. Plus, the fact that he blocked her after she told him makes it look like he's being unfair. \n\nAnother angle: the guy's actions. If he was testing her commitment by breaking up, that's a manipulative move. Healthy relationships don't involve testing like that. So the problem might be on his side for not being honest. \n\nSo overall, she's not in the wrong because she acted based on his initial communication of the breakup. He should have been clear if it wasn't a real breakup. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
