TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after sleeping with others following a breakup that turned out to be a test.\n\nFirst, the guy said he wanted to break up and be friends. The author believed them, ended the relationship, and started seeing others. But the guy later claims it was a test to see if the author would stay loyal. \n\nThe key point here is consent and mutual understanding. When someone breaks up with you, even if they're still in love, the expectation is that the relationship is over. The author had no reason to know it was a test. The guy's actions were deceptive. He lied about the breakup being final, which is a major red flag. \n\nThe author's actions (sleeping with others) were a response to the breakup. Since they were no longer in a relationship, the author wasn't in the wrong for moving on. The guy's anger stems from his own dishonesty and unrealistic expectations. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had. The responsibility lies with the guy for not being honest about his intentions.\n"
