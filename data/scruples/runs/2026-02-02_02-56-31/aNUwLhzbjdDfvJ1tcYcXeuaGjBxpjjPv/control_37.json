TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where Ross breaks up with Rachel, but later reveals he never really wanted to break up.\n\nSo the author was in a relationship where the boyfriend broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken, started using Tinder, slept with others, and then found out that the breakup was a test. Now he's mad at her for sleeping with others after the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong. The key points here are the nature of the breakup and the timeline. The boyfriend ended the relationship, and the author, believing it was an actual breakup, moved on by sleeping with others. However, the boyfriend later admits it was a test, meaning he didn't actually want to end the relationship. \n\nThe author's actions are based on the assumption that the relationship was over. If the boyfriend didn't communicate his intentions clearly, then the author might not be at fault. But the boyfriend's actions (breaking up, then later saying it was a test) are problematic because he didn't clarify his true intentions. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even if the breakup was a test, the author shouldn't have immediately moved on. But since the boyfriend didn't make his feelings clear, she had a right to believe the breakup was genuine. The main issue here is the boyfriend's poor communication and manipulation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup he initiated.\n"
