TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario. The guy broke up with the author, claiming they should just be friends. The author then started seeing others on Tinder and slept with people to boost her self-esteem. Now the guy is upset because he actually wanted to test her loyalty and is angry.\n\nFirst, the key here is the break-up. When someone ends a relationship, it's generally understood that the relationship is over. The author thought they were broken up, so sleeping with others isn't cheating in that context. However, the guy later admitted that the break-up was a test. That complicates things. But from the author's perspective, she had no way of knowing that. She acted based on what she believed was the truth.\n\nThe guy's actions\u2014pretending to break up to test her\u2014are questionable. If he wasn't clear about his intentions, he's at least partially responsible. The author had every right to move on if she thought the relationship was over. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong, especially if there's no prior agreement otherwise. The guy's anger seems more about his own game backfiring than the author acting wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she made the best decision she could based on the information she had. The guy's manipulation here is the real issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
