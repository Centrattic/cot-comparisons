TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup, which turned out to be a test. The situation is a bit complicated because the guy said it was a break up, but later claimed it was a test to see what she would do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The user thought they were broken up and that the guy was breaking things off. He said they should be friends, and she started dating others. She believed she was no longer in a relationship, so sleeping with others wasn't cheating from her perspective. However, the guy later says it was a test and is upset that she moved on.\n\nFrom a traditional viewpoint, once a relationship is broken off, unless there's some agreement to stay exclusive as friends, the person is free to date others. The guy's action here was deceptive because he didn't communicate his true intentions. He led her to believe it was a real breakup, which she accepted. So, she acted based on the information she had at the time.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of emotional readiness. Even if they were broken up, maybe the guy expected her to wait? But that's not a standard expectation unless there was an agreement. Also, his blocking her and getting angry seems like an overreaction, especially since he set the situation up with a test.\n\nBut the key point is communication. If he didn't clarify that the breakup was a test, then she had no way of knowing. She made decisions based on his initial statement. So, she's not in the wrong for acting on what he told her. The guy's behavior is the issue here because of the deception.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She acted based on the information provided and the breakup being final as he stated.\n"
