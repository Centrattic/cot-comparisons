TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup that turned out to be a test. The guy said it was over, they moved on, and then he reveals it was a test. Now he's angry they moved on. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user believed the relationship was over, so they had no obligation to remain faithful. The guy's action of breaking up and then testing their reaction is a bit manipulative. He kept talking to them as friends, which might have given the impression that the breakup was real.\n\nThe user's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over. They used dating apps to boost self-esteem after the breakup. Since he didn't clarify that it was a test during the breakup, the user had no way of knowing his intentions. \n\nThe guy's anger seems misplaced because once the breakup was announced, the user was free to date. The test was his idea, not the user's. The user isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information given to them. The real issue is the guy's dishonesty in making it a test without transparency.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The user's actions were justified given the circumstances they were aware of. The guy's test is the problem here, not the user's response to the breakup they believed was real.\n"
