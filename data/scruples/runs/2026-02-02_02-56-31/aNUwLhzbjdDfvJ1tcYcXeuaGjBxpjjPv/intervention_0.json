  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup that turned out to be a test. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy never reciprocated as strongly. He broke up with them, saying they should just be friends. The user was heartbroken but tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. Then, when they mentioned that, he blocked them. It turns out the breakup was a test to see how they'd react, and now he's angry they moved on.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. When the guy broke up with her, he clearly stated he wanted to be just friends. The user assumed the relationship was over, so they ended the relationship and started dating others. From an ethical standpoint, once a relationship ends, unless there are specific boundaries (like a breakup test), each person is free to date others. However, the twist here is that the breakup wasn't genuine; it was a test. \n\nBut here's the catch: the guy never mentioned that the breakup was a test. He went ahead and ended the relationship, left her heartbroken, and then later implies it was a test. The user had no way of knowing this. So from her perspective, she followed through with his decision to end things and moved on. \n\nIn terms of infidelity, if the breakup was real, sleeping with others isn't cheating. But if the breakup was a test, maybe he still considered the relationship ongoing. However, the user had no indication of that test. So the guy's actions were deceptive. \n\nThe user's actions were based on the information they had at the time. They acted in good faith, thinking the relationship was over. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he didn't communicate his true intentions. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong because they acted on the breakup as it was presented to them. The responsibility lies with the guy for not being honest about the test from the start. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
