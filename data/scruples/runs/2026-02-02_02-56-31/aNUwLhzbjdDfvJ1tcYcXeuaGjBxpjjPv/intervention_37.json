TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people after a breakup. The guy said it was a break up, but later revealed it was a test. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The user thought they were broken up and started seeing others. The guy claims he wasn't really breaking up but testing her. But from the user's perspective, they were told it was over, so they moved on. \n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test. If he said they were just friends, the user had no reason to believe the relationship was still ongoing. So, from an outsider's view, the user isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information given.\n\nHowever, the guy's actions were deceptive. He pretended to break up to test her, which is manipulative. The user didn't know, so sleeping with others after a breakup is a personal choice, especially if they thought the relationship was over. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or relationship norm aspect. Some people might argue that even if you're not in a relationship, sleeping with someone else while they're still emotionally involved could be seen as wrong. But in this case, the user wasn't in a relationship anymore. \n\nAlso, the user's intention was to boost self-esteem, which is understandable. The problem arises from the guy's dishonesty. He created a situation where he expected her to stay faithful without being clear. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the guy is at fault for not being honest. The user acted based on his initial statement. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe if there were ongoing discussions or if the user knew there was a possibility of the break up being a test. But according to the story, the user had no reason to suspect that. So, yeah, B makes sense.\n"
