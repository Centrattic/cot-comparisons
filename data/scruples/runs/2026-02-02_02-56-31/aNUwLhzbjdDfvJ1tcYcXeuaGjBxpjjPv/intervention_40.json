TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with others after a breakup, only to find out the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The user was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate as strongly. He breaks up, saying it's better to be friends. The user, heartbroken and trying to build self-esteem, uses Tinder and sleeps with others. The guy later claims the breakup was a test to see the user's reaction and is now angry at their actions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The user believed the relationship was over. 2) They started dating others as a way to move on. 3) The guy's breakup was a test, which he didn't disclose upfront.\n\nFrom a typical perspective, if someone ends a relationship, the other person is generally free to date others. However, the twist here is that the guy didn't actually end the relationship; he was testing the user's loyalty. But the user had no way of knowing that. They acted based on the information they had.\n\nThe user's actions seem understandable given the circumstances. They were trying to heal and regain self-esteem. The guy's actions are questionable because he didn't communicate his intentions clearly. Testing someone's loyalty by pretending to break up without explaining his true feelings seems manipulative.\n\nNow, considering the question: Am I in the wrong? If the user believed the relationship was over, then they weren't in the wrong for moving on. The responsibility lies with the guy for not being honest about his intentions. So, the answer would be B (No, the user is not in the wrong). The user acted based on the breakup they were told about, and the guy's test was a deceitful move.\n"
