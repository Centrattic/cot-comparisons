  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The user then started dating others on Tinder, thinking they were no longer in a relationship. But then it turns out the guy never actually ended the relationship; he was testing her to see if she'd stay faithful. Now he's upset that she slept with others and blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline and communication. The guy said they were just friends, but later says it was a test. If he was still in love and wanted to test her loyalty, did he communicate that clearly? From the user's perspective, he said they were broken up, so she acted accordingly. She didn't know it was a test. So, was she wrong to move on?\n\nThe key points here are the clarity of the breakup. If the guy claimed it was a breakup, then the user's actions might be justified. However, if he never officially ended things and was just testing, then the user might be in the wrong. But the problem is that the user believed the breakup was real. So, who is responsible for the miscommunication?\n\nAlso, the user was trying to rebuild her self-esteem after the breakup. Sleeping with others as a way to cope could be seen as understandable, even if it's not the best approach. But if the guy was still in a relationship (even if unspoken), then she was cheating. However, since he led her to believe they were over, she might not be at fault.\n\nAnother angle: consent and mutual understanding in relationships. If one person believes the relationship is over, but the other hasn't actually ended it, there's a breakdown in communication. The user acted on the information given to her. The guy's test was unethical because he didn't be transparent about his intentions. He shouldn't have used a breakup as a test. So the guy's actions are questionable here.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she was given. The guy's test was a manipulative move, and he's holding her accountable for something that didn't happen under clear terms. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
