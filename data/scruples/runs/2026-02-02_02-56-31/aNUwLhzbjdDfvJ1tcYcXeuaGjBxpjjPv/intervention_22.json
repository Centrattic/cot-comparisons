TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup that turned out to be a test. Hmm. So the guy broke up with her, right? She thought it was over, so she started dating others. But then he comes back saying he was just testing her commitment. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. If a breakup is mutual and clear, then moving on is normal. But in this case, the guy didn't actually break up with her; it was a test. So from her perspective, she had every reason to believe it was over. She didn't know he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. \n\nHer actions: after the \"breakup,\" she used Tinder and slept with others. She felt she had no obligation to be loyal since they weren't together anymore. But he's now angry because he wanted to see if she'd stay faithful. \n\nBut wait, if he was testing her, he's the one who initiated the breakup. If he was still in love and wanted to test her, that's his own issue. She acted based on the information she had. She didn't know it was a test. So from an ethical standpoint, she wasn't cheating because they weren't in a relationship anymore. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if he was still emotionally involved, maybe it wasn't a clean breakup. But he did tell her to be friends, so she had no reason to think otherwise. His actions of testing her commitment put her in a tough spot. \n\nSo the main question is whether she was in the wrong. Since she believed the relationship was over and acted accordingly, she's not at fault. The guy's test was deceptive, leading to this conflict. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
