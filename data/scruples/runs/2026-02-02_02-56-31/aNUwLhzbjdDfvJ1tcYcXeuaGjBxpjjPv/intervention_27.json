  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if they're in the wrong in this situation. So, the scenario is that they were in a relationship with a guy who said they needed to be just friends, which the user took as a breakup. The user then started seeing other people on Tinder to boost their self-esteem, thinking they were free to do so since they weren't in a relationship anymore. The guy later revealed that the breakup was a test to see how she would react, and he's upset she slept with others. Now he's blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user was wrong. The key points here are the communication between both parties. The guy said they should be friends, but the user assumed it was a breakup. The problem is that he didn't clarify his intentions. If he was still in love and the breakup was a test, maybe he didn't mean it to be permanent. But from the user's perspective, they acted based on his statement. \n\nBut here's the catch: if the guy said \"just friends\" and she took it as a breakup, then moving on by dating others would be reasonable. However, if there was any ambiguity, maybe the user should have asked for clarification. But the user didn't know he was testing her; that's on him. The guy's friend mentioned it was a test, but the user had no way of knowing that. So she made a decision based on the information given. \n\nIn relationships, when one person says they want to be friends, the other might assume the relationship is over. The user's actions are understandable as a way to heal. The guy's reaction seems unfair because he didn't communicate his true intentions. The user wasn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. The guy's test was deceptive, which is manipulative. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
