TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user was in a relationship with a guy who said they should be just friends. The user thought it was a breakup and started dating others. Then the guy later claims he was just testing to see if the user would stay faithful, and he's upset she slept with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. She believed the guy had broken up with her, so she wasn't in a relationship anymore. If you're not in a relationship, there's no obligation to be faithful, right? So from her side, she thought she was free to date others. However, the guy later says he was still in love and the breakup was a test. That's a bit manipulative, maybe? People usually don't test breakups like that. If he was in love, why would he initiate a breakup as a test?\n\nBut then there's the aspect of trust. If he was still emotionally involved and wanted to test her reaction, maybe he had some expectations. However, if he didn't clarify his intentions and she acted on her understanding of the situation, then he can't really blame her. The problem here is communication. He didn't make it clear that he was still interested in a relationship or that his \"breakup\" was a test. \n\nAlso, when someone is in a relationship and then the other person says they want to be friends, the common assumption is that the relationship is over. So the user wasn't wrong in taking that at face value. She acted on the information given to her. The guy's reaction seems unfair because he set up the scenario without being honest about his intentions. \n\nBut then again, maybe he thought he had a right to test her loyalty. However, that's not a healthy approach. Relationships require mutual understanding and honesty. If he was still interested, he should have communicated that instead of using a test. His behavior could be seen as manipulative, which is a problem on his end. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user thought the relationship was over and acted accordingly. The guy's actions were deceptive, and he's now holding her accountable for something that happened after he ended the relationship. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
