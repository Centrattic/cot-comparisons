TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy ended the relationship, so the author started seeing other people. But the guy later said he was just testing if the author would stay faithful, and now he's upset that she slept with others even though they weren't in a relationship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy claimed to break up, so they weren't in a relationship anymore. If that's the case, the author isn't obligated to remain faithful. However, there's a twist here: the guy admitted that the breakup was a test. But even if he was in love and wanted to see her reaction, that doesn't necessarily give him the right to be upset. If the breakup was real at the time, then the author's actions were within her rights. \n\nBut maybe the ambiguity of the situation matters. If the guy didn't make it clear that the breakup was permanent and just a test, then the author had no way of knowing. However, the responsibility is on him to communicate his intentions clearly. If he ended the relationship and then later claimed it was a test, that's a problem because the author had no way of knowing. \n\nOn the other hand, the author went ahead and slept with others after the breakup. If they were truly not in a relationship, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. But if the breakup was a test, maybe there was an unspoken agreement to stay apart. However, in most relationships, once you're broken up, there's no expectation of fidelity unless both parties agree otherwise. \n\nSo, the author's actions were based on the information she had at the time. The guy's test was his way of trying to gauge her commitment, but he didn't make that clear. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup being real. The guy's anger stems from his own ambiguous actions. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or social expectation here. Some people might argue that even if you're not in a relationship anymore, sleeping with others during a \"test period\" is wrong. However, in most cases, once a relationship ends, people are free to date others. The guy's test complicates things, but he didn't communicate that properly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the breakup being real. The guy's actions were manipulative by testing her without clear communication. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
