TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for sleeping with new people after their partner ended the relationship, which they believed was a breakup. The guy later said it was a test to see what she would do, leading to anger when she moved on.\n\nFirst, the key point is the assumption that the relationship was over. If the guy didn't clarify that it was a breakup and instead continued talking, maybe the user had a right to believe it was over. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong unless there were specific boundaries agreed upon. However, if the guy was still emotionally involved and considered the relationship ongoing, that's a problem. But from the user's perspective, they acted based on the information they had. The guy's actions of making it a test without clear communication might make him at fault. So, the user isn't necessarily wrong because they acted on the belief that the relationship had ended. The issue here is poor communication from both sides. The user's actions were a way to cope, and the guy's test was manipulative. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
