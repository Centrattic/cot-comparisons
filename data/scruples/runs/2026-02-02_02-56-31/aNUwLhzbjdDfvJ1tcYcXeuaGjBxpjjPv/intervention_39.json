TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong here. The situation is that their ex decided to break up but then later said it was a test. The user, thinking they were over, started dating others, which led to the ex getting angry now.\n\nFirst, I need to break down what happened. The user believed they were in a breakup. The ex said they wanted to be friends and that it was better that way. The user, hurt and trying to move on, started seeing others. But the ex later claims the breakup wasn't real\u2014it was a test to see if the user would stay faithful.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup. The user thought the relationship was over, so maybe they didn't see it as cheating. But the ex's friend says the breakup was a test. That's tricky because the user had no way of knowing that. \n\nConsent and communication are key in relationships. If the ex didn't communicate that the breakup was a test, then the user had a reasonable assumption that the relationship was over. The user's actions were based on that assumption. However, if the ex felt there was an unspoken agreement to stay exclusive even after a fake breakup, that's a problem. But realistically, the user couldn't know the ex's true intentions unless there was prior agreement.\n\nCheating typically involves being in a committed relationship and having sex with someone else. But in this case, the user thought the relationship was over. So, technically, they weren't cheating. However, if there was an unspoken commitment or a test that wasn't communicated, the user might be in the wrong. But without clear communication, it's hard to hold the user accountable.\n\nThe ex's behavior is questionable. Using a breakup as a test is manipulative. The user acted on the information given. So, in this scenario, the user isn't at fault because they followed the ex's lead. The ex's anger is misplaced because the user had no way of knowing the breakup was a test. The ex should have been clear about their intentions if they wanted to test the user's loyalty. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the user isn't in the wrong. The fault lies with the ex for not being transparent and for manipulating the situation.\n"
