TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author believed their boyfriend had broken up with them, so they started seeing other people. But then the boyfriend said the breakup was a test, and he's angry about her sleeping with others. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author made a mistake. The key points here are the assumption of a breakup and the ex's intention to test her. The author thought they were no longer in a relationship, so they used Tinder and had sex with others. But the ex claims it was a breakup test, and he's upset.\n\nLegally, once a breakup happens, there's no obligation to remain faithful. So if the author believed they were single, sleeping with others isn't cheating. However, if the breakup wasn't real, then the author might have cheated without realizing it. But the problem here is the communication. The ex told her to be friends, but then later said it was a test. That seems like bad communication or maybe manipulation.\n\nThe ex's actions are questionable. Using a breakup as a test is manipulative. The author acted on the assumption that the relationship was over. She had the right to start dating again once they were no longer in a relationship. The ex's anger is misplaced because he didn't clarify that the breakup wasn't real. However, the author might have acted on assumptions without confirming the actual status of the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she made a decision based on the information she had. If the ex's test was a secret and he didn't communicate that they were still together, then the author isn't at fault. The ex is the one who created a confusing situation. However, some people might argue that the author should have known better or been more cautious. But realistically, if someone officially breaks up and says to be friends, trusting that is reasonable. The ex's behavior is more problematic here. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
