TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for sleeping with others after a breakup, only to find out the breakup was a test by their ex. \n\nFirst, the key points: The guy ended the relationship, saying they should be friends. The user, heartbroken, moved on by dating others, thinking the relationship was over. Then, the ex revealed the breakup was a test to see if they'd stay loyal. Now he's mad because they didn't.\n\nSo the user thought they were single, right? If the relationship was truly over, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. But the twist is the breakup wasn't real. However, the user had no way of knowing that at the time. The ex didn't communicate that it was a test. So the user acted based on the information they had, which was that they were no longer in a relationship. \n\nBut the ex is upset because they wanted to see if the user would remain faithful. That's a bit manipulative, in my opinion. The user can't be blamed for moving on after being dumped, especially when they were still in love. The ex's actions were deceptive. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if the relationship was still ongoing, even if not acknowledged, then the user was unfaithful. But the ex didn't clarify that. So the user wasn't in the wrong for acting on the breakup they were told to accept. \n\nThe main issue here is the ex's manipulation. The user isn't at fault because they relied on the breakup being real. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
