  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following what they believed was a breakup. The guy said he broke up because he wanted to be friends, but it turns out he was testing if she'd stay loyal. Now he's angry.\n\nFirst, the main point is consent and communication. When someone ends a relationship, even if it's not clear-cut, the expectation is that things are over unless there's some mutual understanding otherwise. She thought it was a breakup, so she moved on. That's understandable. But the guy's actions\u2014pretending to break up to test her\u2014complicate things. \n\nHe didn't communicate his intentions clearly. Testing someone's loyalty by breaking up isn't a healthy approach. If he was still in love, he should have addressed his feelings instead of using a breakup as a test. Her sleeping with others wasn't a betrayal in the traditional sense because he ended the relationship. But maybe he felt the test made it a different situation. \n\nHowever, his method of testing was manipulative. She had a right to move on after a breakup. So, while she might feel guilty, she's not in the wrong because she acted based on his stated intentions. His anger stems from his own unclear communication and manipulative behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
