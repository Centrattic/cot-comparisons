TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. She then started dating other people via Tinder, thinking it was okay because they weren't together anymore. Now he's mad because he actually was doing a \"test\" to see how she'd react and is upset she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she did something wrong. The key points here are consent and the nature of the breakup. If he ended the relationship, then she's not in a committed relationship anymore. So sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. But he later says the breakup was a test. That sounds manipulative. \n\nBut wait, in most cases, if someone breaks up, even if there's ambiguity, the responsibility is on the person initiating the breakup to clarify their intentions. The author thought it was over, so acting on that by moving on is her right. The ex's test was deceptive. So, he set up a situation where he broke up but expected her to stay faithful, which isn't fair. \n\nHowever, the author might have jumped into new relationships too quickly, but that's her choice post-breakup. The main issue is his manipulative behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She acted based on the information given to her. The wrong lies with him for not being honest about his intentions.\n"
