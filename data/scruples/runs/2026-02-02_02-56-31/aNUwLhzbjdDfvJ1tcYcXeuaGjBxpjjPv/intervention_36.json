TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after a breakup. So, the situation: they were in a relationship with a guy who didn't express his feelings as strongly as they did. He broke up, saying they should just be friends. The user tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with others, thinking the relationship was over. Now the guy is mad because he claimed the breakup was a test to see if she would stay faithful, and he was still in love. He blocked her and won't talk.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she was wrong. The key points here are about the breakup and the expectations. If he said they were just friends and ended the relationship, then she's not in a relationship anymore. In that case, sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. But the guy later says it was a test, implying he never intended the breakup to be real. So, there's a lack of communication and clarity here. The guy's actions were deceptive. She made the assumption based on his declaration of a breakup. However, the guy's friend mentioned the breakup was a test, which complicates things.\n\nBut legally and ethically, once a breakup is declared, the relationship is over. The user isn't obligated to remain monogamous unless there are specific agreements. The problem lies in the fact that the guy didn't clearly state his intentions. If he thought it was a test, he should have communicated that. The user acted based on the information she had at the time. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
