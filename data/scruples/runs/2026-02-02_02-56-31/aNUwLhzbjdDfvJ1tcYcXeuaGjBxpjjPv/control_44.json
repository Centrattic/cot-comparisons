TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where a breakup is declared but emotions are still involved. \n\nFirst, the guy broke up with the author, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others, thinking the relationship was over. Then the guy reveals the breakup was a test\u2014he still loved her and wanted to see her reaction. Now he's mad and blocked her.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are: the guy ended the relationship and said they should be friends. The author, believing it was over, moved on. But the guy's breakup was a test. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone ends a relationship, the other person is generally expected to move on. The author did that, which is understandable. The guy's action of making a fake breakup to test her reaction is questionable. He was dishonest about his intentions. The author had no way of knowing it was a test, so her actions were based on the information she had. \n\nThe guy is upset because she moved on, but he manipulated the situation by pretending to break up. His anger seems misplaced because the problem originated from his dishonesty. The author isn't in the wrong for acting on the breakup he declared. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
