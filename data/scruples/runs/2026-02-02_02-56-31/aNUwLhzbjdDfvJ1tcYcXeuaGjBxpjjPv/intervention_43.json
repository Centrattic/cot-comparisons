TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup, which they later found out was a test by their ex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy broke up, they thought it was over, so they started dating others. But then they found out the breakup was a test to see how they'd react. He's now angry about them sleeping with others. \n\nSo the key points: they believed the relationship was over, so they moved on. But he didn't actually end the relationship; he was testing their loyalty. Now he's upset. \n\nThe user's question is whether they're in the wrong. From an objective standpoint, if the relationship was truly over, then sleeping with others isn't wrong because there's no ongoing commitment. However, if the breakup was a test and he never intended to end things, he might feel betrayed. \n\nBut the problem here is communication. The guy didn't clarify his intentions. If he was testing them, that's a bit manipulative. The user wasn't aware it was a test, so acting on the assumption that the relationship was over seems reasonable. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had. The wrong lies with the guy for not being transparent about his true intentions. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
