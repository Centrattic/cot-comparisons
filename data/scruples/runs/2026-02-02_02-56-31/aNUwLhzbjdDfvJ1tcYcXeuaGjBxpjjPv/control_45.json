TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with a guy who said they should just be friends. The guy didn't express strong feelings but hinted sometimes. After the breakup, the author started using Tinder and slept with others, thinking it was okay because they weren't in a relationship anymore. Then, the guy revealed he broke up with her as a test to see how she'd react. He's now angry because she slept with others during that time.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong? Well, the guy said they were just friends, so technically, they weren't in a relationship anymore. The author didn't know it was a test. She thought it was a real breakup. If he considered it a test, maybe he didn't actually break up with her. But from her perspective, she believed the breakup was real. She took steps to move on, which is understandable. However, sleeping with others might have crossed a line if he still saw them as a couple. But since he didn't communicate that it was a test, she couldn't have known. The problem arises from his hidden intentions. The author acted based on what she was told. \n\nBut maybe there's more to consider. If he really was in love and wanted to stay together, using a fake breakup as a test could be manipulative. The author wasn't in the wrong if she believed the breakup was real. But if they were still in a relationship in his eyes, then her actions might be considered cheating. However, since he didn't clarify that it was a test, she couldn't have known. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The guy didn't set boundaries or clarify the situation, so the author acted on the information she had. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The fault might lie more with the guy for not being honest about his intentions. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
