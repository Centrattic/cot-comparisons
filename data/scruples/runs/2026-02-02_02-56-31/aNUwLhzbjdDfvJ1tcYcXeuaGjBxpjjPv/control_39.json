TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. So, the situation is that the guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to rebuild self-esteem, started dating others on Tinder. The guy later revealed the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay loyal, and now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nHmm. First, the key points are: he called it off, they were supposed to be friends, she moved on by sleeping with others, and he was testing her. Now he's upset. The question is whether she's wrong.\n\nWell, from her perspective, he broke up with her. She wasn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. But he didn't actually end the relationship; he was testing her. That's a bit sneaky. But the problem here is communication. She assumed the breakup was real, and he didn't clarify. However, she also moved on, which might be normal after a breakup. \n\nBut he's upset because he thought she'd be loyal if they were broken up. But if he was still in love and testing her, maybe he should have been upfront. However, she thought the relationship was over. So, technically, she wasn't in a relationship anymore. But if the breakup was fake, then maybe she is at fault because she didn't know the truth. But she had no way of knowing it was a test. \n\nWait, he was adamant about being friends, so she had every reason to believe it was over. So sleeping with others isn't wrong if she's not in a relationship. But maybe the problem is that he didn't clarify his intentions. But the author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. So she's not in the wrong here. Therefore, answer B.\n"
