TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is at fault. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel storyline from Friends. The main points are: the man broke up with the woman, claiming they should just be friends. She, heartbroken and trying to move on, used Tinder and slept with others. Later, she found out he was testing her loyalty by breaking up, and he's now angry and blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who is at fault. The woman thought they were broken up, so she moved on, which is understandable. She took steps to rebuild her self-esteem, which was harmed by the breakup. The man, however, fabricated a breakup as a test, which is manipulative. His actions set up a scenario where he could judge her behavior without clear communication. \n\nThe key here is consent and communication. If the man never clearly communicated that the breakup wasn't real, she had no way of knowing. But he did say it was a breakup and wanted to be friends. She acted based on that. His anger seems hypocritical because he set up the test but is upset with her actions. The problem is that he didn't maintain honesty from the start. \n\nThe woman isn't wrong for moving on when she believed they were over. The man's manipulation is the root issue here. However, the question is whether she's at fault. Since she acted based on his stated intentions and he's the one who created a deceptive situation, she's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
