TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends, which I remember was about breakups and misunderstandings.\n\nSo, the guy broke up with the author, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to rebuild self-esteem, started seeing people on Tinder. Then she found out that the guy's breakup was actually a test to see how she'd react, and now he's angry because she cheated or slept with others even though they were supposed to be over.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was in a committed relationship when she started seeing others. The guy said they were just friends, but maybe there were lingering feelings or expectations. Wait, the author believed it was a breakup and was moving on. But the guy claims it was a test, implying he never really wanted to break up. So, was the breakup real or not?\n\nIf the author genuinely thought the relationship was over, then sleeping with others after a breakup isn't cheating. Cheating implies being in a relationship and being unfaithful. But if the guy's breakup was a test, maybe he intended to continue the relationship. However, the author wasn't aware of that. She acted based on the information she had. \n\nThe key issue here is consent and communication. The guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test. He told her it was over, so she had every right to move on. The problem is that he manipulated the situation by pretending to break up. His actions led her to believe it was over, and now he's upset about her moving on. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the guy is being dishonest by using a breakup as a test. The author isn't in the wrong because she acted in good faith based on his initial statement. Even if the guy was still in love, his method of testing her was manipulative. The author's actions were a response to a perceived breakup, so she's not at fault. \n\nBut wait, maybe the guy's intention was to see if she'd stay faithful, so does that make her sleeping with others wrong? But she wasn't in a relationship anymore as far as she knew. The guy's test doesn't give him the right to be angry if he didn't communicate his true intentions. Therefore, the blame should be on the guy for the deception.\n"
