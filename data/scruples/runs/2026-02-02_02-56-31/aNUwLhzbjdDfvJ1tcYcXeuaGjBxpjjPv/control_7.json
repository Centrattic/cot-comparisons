TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for sleeping with others after a breakup, but it turns out the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, the guy ended the relationship, right? He said they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, moves on by using Tinder and sleeps with others. Then he gets angry when she tells him, even though they weren't together anymore.\n\nWait, the problem is that he actually didn't break up for real. He was testing her, wanted to see her reaction. But from her side, she thought it was a real breakup. So, if a breakup is mutual and official, sleeping with others isn't cheating. But here, the guy didn't actually end the relationship; he just wanted to test her. But from her perspective, she thought it was over. \n\nSo the key here is consent and communication. If the guy didn't communicate that he was still in a relationship and that the breakup was a test, then maybe he's at fault too. But the author assumed they were broken up, so she took steps to move on. However, if he was still emotionally involved and considered them in a relationship, then sleeping with others might be seen as a betrayal. But the twist is he's angry now because of his own test. \n\nBut ethically, if you end a relationship, the other person is free to date. Unless there were specific boundaries agreed upon. The author thought it was over, so she's not in the wrong. The guy's actions (testing her) were manipulative. He should have been honest. Therefore, the author isn't at fault. Answer B.\n"
