TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people after what they thought was a breakup. The guy said he broke up with her as a test to see her reaction. She thought they were over, so she moved on by sleeping with others. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The woman believed the relationship was over. If a partner tells you they want to be friends and breaks up, it's reasonable to assume the relationship has ended. Moving on and exploring other connections is a common way people cope post-breakup. She didn't know it was a test, so she wasn't aware the relationship was still active. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's actions were deceptive. Setting up a test without clear communication is manipulative. If he was still in love, maybe he should have been honest instead of creating a scenario that led to her moving on. His anger seems misplaced because he didn't clarify the situation. \n\nBut wait, the question is whether she's at fault. Since she acted in good faith based on his declaration of a breakup, she might not be wrong. However, some might argue that even after a breakup, there's a period of transition where expectations aren't always clear. Yet, the key here is that the breakup was a test, which he didn't communicate. So, the responsibility lies with him for not being transparent. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. If he intended to test her loyalty without telling her the real reason for the breakup, that's a problem. Therefore, she's not in the wrong because she didn't know it wasn't a breakup. He made the situation confusing by keeping his intentions hidden. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
