TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends where Ross pretends to break up to test Rachel's feelings.\n\nFirst, the guy claims he broke up because he thought they should just be friends. The author believed it was a breakup, so they used Tinder and slept with others. The guy later says it was a test to see if she'd stay faithful. He's upset she moved on, but he didn't clarify his intentions at the time.\n\nThe key points here: the guy didn't communicate that the breakup was a test. He left her thinking they were over, which is a big deal. The author acted on her belief that they were no longer together, trying to boost her self-esteem. The guy's actions are manipulative because he set up a situation without being honest about his intentions. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. If someone creates ambiguity or tests another person's loyalty without clear communication, they're not in a position to be upset. The author wasn't aware of the test, so she made a decision based on what she thought was a breakup. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The guy's behavior is problematic. So the answer should be B.\n"
