  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault here. They were in a relationship where they were really in love, but the guy ended it, saying they should be friends. She got over it by getting on Tinder and sleeping with others. Then she found out he broke up with her as a test to see if she'd still be loyal. Now he's mad and blocked her.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether she was wrong to sleep with others after a breakup. But there's a twist: he claimed it was a breakup but actually wanted to test her. So, from her perspective, she thought they were no longer together, so she had no obligation. But he didn't actually break up with her, he just wanted to see her reaction. \n\nSo, was the breakup real? If he didn't actually end the relationship, then technically she was still in a committed relationship and sleeping with others would be cheating. But she believed it was over because he told her to be friends. That's a gray area. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and communication are key. If he lied about breaking up, that's on him. But she also made the decision to sleep with others based on his words. She might not have known the truth, so maybe she's not at fault. But if he was still in love and wanted to test her, then his actions were manipulative. \n\nDifferent people might have different views. Some say she was wrong because if there was any doubt, she should have clarified. Others might say he's at fault for using a fake breakup as a test. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she acted based on his stated intention to break up, she might not be at fault. However, if there was a possibility he was lying, maybe she should have been more cautious. But realistically, people can't read minds. So the answer might be B, No. But there's nuance here.\n"
