TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy ended the relationship, the author thought it was a breakup, then they started dating again, and the guy later claims the breakup was a test. The author went on Tinder and slept with others, thinking they were just friends now. Now the guy is upset because he says he was still in love and the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The guy said he broke up, so the author believed they were no longer a couple. When someone breaks up, generally, there's an expectation that they're not exclusive anymore. The author tried to move on, which is reasonable after a breakup. But if the guy was lying about breaking up as a test, then maybe he didn't actually want to end things. But the problem here is whether the author acted wrongfully.\n\nThe key point is that the author thought they were friends, so sleeping with others wasn't cheating. Cheating implies being in a committed relationship. If the guy had ended the relationship, technically the author wasn't cheating. However, if there was any ambiguity or if there was a mutual understanding that they were still in a relationship (even if one person thought it was a test), then maybe the author was wrong. But the guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test until after the fact. The author had no way of knowing that. \n\nAlso, the guy blocking her after finding out seems harsh. If the breakup was a test, that's a manipulative move. The author's actions were based on the breakup being real. So the guy's anger might be misplaced. The author isn't obligated to stay loyal if there's no relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had at the time.\n"
