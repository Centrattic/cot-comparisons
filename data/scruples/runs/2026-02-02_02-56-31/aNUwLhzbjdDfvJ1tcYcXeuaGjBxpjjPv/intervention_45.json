  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy never reciprocated the same level of feelings. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends, and she was heartbroken. After some time, she started dating others on Tinder to boost her self-esteem, thinking they were no longer a couple. Then, she found out he was using the breakup as a test to see her reaction and is now angry.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the definition of the breakup. He said they were just friends, which typically means the relationship ended. If that's the case, she's not in the wrong for moving on. The problem arises if the breakup wasn't mutual or clear. But from her perspective, he initiated the breakup, so she assumed they were no longer together. She had no obligation to stay celibate unless they had a specific agreement. \n\nHowever, the twist is that he was using the breakup as a test. This is problematic because testing someone's loyalty without clear communication is manipulative. If he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, that's on him for not being honest. His anger seems unwarranted if they were truly broken up, as she was within her rights to date others. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there was some ambiguity in their relationship status. If he never explicitly confirmed the breakup or if they continued to talk as if they were still together, that could muddy the waters. But the user's account says he was adamant about being friends, so she had reason to believe it was over. \n\nIn relationships, trust and clear communication are key. If he wanted to test her, that's his fault for not setting clear boundaries. She acted based on the information she had at the time. So, she's not in the wrong. The real issue is his manipulation and lack of clear communication. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no hidden context. The fact that he was testing her loyalty without being upfront is a red flag. She made a decision based on what she thought was the breakup, so she's not at fault here.\n"
