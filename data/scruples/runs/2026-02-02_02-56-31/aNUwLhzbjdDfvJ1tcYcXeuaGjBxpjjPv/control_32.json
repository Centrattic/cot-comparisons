TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author was in a relationship, the guy broke up with her and said they should be friends. She thought it was a breakup, so she started dating others to get over it. But he was actually testing her by breaking up, and now he's angry because she slept with others. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship. The guy claimed it was a breakup, but it was actually a test. The author had no obligation to him once they were \"broken up,\" so she started seeing others. However, the guy was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, but when she did that, he became angry. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she took the breakup at face value. She was hurt, tried to move on, and did what she thought was appropriate after the relationship ended. The guy's actions were deceptive because he didn't communicate his true feelings or intentions. He used a breakup as a test, which isn't straightforward. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for sleeping with others after believing the relationship was over. Ethically, if there was no ongoing commitment, then it's her choice. However, if the guy didn't actually end the relationship and the author was under a misunderstanding, maybe there's some nuance. But based on the information given, the author had no way of knowing it wasn't a real breakup. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The guy's test seems manipulative. The author acted based on the information she had. She's not in the wrong for moving on after a breakup, especially if she was led to believe it was over. The problem lies with the guy not being honest about his intentions. \n\nSo the answer would be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup she thought was real, and the guy's test was deceptive.\n"
