  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup, which turned out to be a test by their ex. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends.\n\nFirst, the user's ex broke up, saying they wanted to be friends. The user, heartbroken and trying to move on, used Tinder and slept with others. The ex then blocked them and got angry because the breakup was a test to see how the user would react. \n\nThe key points here are the timeline and the nature of the breakup. The user believed they were broken up because the ex said so. They had no indication that the breakup was a test. The ex's friend clarified it was a test, but the user wasn't aware of that at the time. \n\nSo, from the user's perspective, they thought the relationship was over. In that case, sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong because they were no longer in a committed relationship. However, the ex's anger stems from the fact that the breakup wasn't real, so he still saw them as a couple. But since the user had no knowledge of this test, they acted in good faith. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user should have known? The ex was vague about the breakup. However, the ex did say they should be friends, and the user tried to comply. It's not clear if the user had prior signs that the breakup was a test. \n\nIn relationships, being honest is key. The ex didn't communicate their intentions clearly. The user acted based on the information given. So in this scenario, the user isn't in the wrong because they followed the breakup as communicated. The ex's test was a deception, which complicates things. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, No, the user isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the breakup they were told about and had no reason to believe otherwise.\n"
