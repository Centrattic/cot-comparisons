TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup where the guy said they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started dating others via Tinder. Then the guy says the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay faithful, and he's angry when she slept with others.\n\nFirst, the key point is whether the breakup was genuine. The guy said they were just friends, but later claimed it was a test. That's a red flag. If the breakup was real, then the author is not in the wrong because they weren't in a relationship anymore. But if the breakup was a test, then maybe she did something wrong by moving on. However, the problem is that the guy didn't clarify that it was a test. He presented it as a real breakup, so she acted accordingly. \n\nAlso, the guy's actions are questionable. Using a breakup as a test is manipulative. If he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, that's deceitful. The author had a right to her emotional well-being after the breakup, which he caused. She turned to Tinder to rebuild her self-esteem, which is understandable after a breakup. \n\nBut the main issue is the authenticity of the breakup. Since he didn't clarify that it wasn't a real breakup, she made a decision based on the information she had. So, she isn't in the wrong. The guy is being inconsistent and controlling. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
