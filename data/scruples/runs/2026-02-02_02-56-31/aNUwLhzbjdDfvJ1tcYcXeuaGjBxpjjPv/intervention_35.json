TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people after their partner broke up with them, but later found out the break up was just a test. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The user believed they were broken up because their partner said it's better to be friends. The partner then expected the user to stay faithful even after the break up, but didn't communicate that there was no actual break up. The user started seeing others to boost their self-esteem and heal, not knowing the break up wasn't real.\n\nBut here's the twist: the partner broke up as a test to see what the user would do. That's pretty manipulative. If the user thought they were single, they might not see sleeping with others as cheating. However, the partner's actions here are questionable. They kept talking after the supposed break up, which might have kept the user confused. Also, the partner didn't clarify the real intentions, leading to the user moving on.\n\nSo, was the user in the wrong? Well, in a typical break up scenario, once it's over, each person can date others. But since the partner never actually ended the relationship and instead used a fake break up as a test, the user's actions might be justified from their perspective. However, the partner's deception complicates things. The user didn't know the truth, so they acted based on the information they had. But the partner's anger is because they never intended a real break up, so they see the user's actions as betrayal.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. The partner didn't clearly state their intentions and used a test without the user's knowledge. The user acted in good faith based on the break up. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong because they were unaware of the partner's true intentions. The fault here might lie more with the partner for manipulating the situation.\n"
