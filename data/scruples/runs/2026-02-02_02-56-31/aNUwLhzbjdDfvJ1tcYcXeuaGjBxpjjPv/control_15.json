TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where a breakup is declared but the relationship is later considered ongoing. \n\nSo, the author's ex said they wanted to be just friends. The author took that as a breakup and started seeing others. Then the ex claims he was testing her loyalty and is now angry. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries of the relationship. If the ex claimed a breakup, then the author isn't in a relationship anymore. So, moving on and dating others isn't wrong. However, the ex's test complicates things. If the ex was still in love and didn't truly want a breakup, but the author acted on the assumption that it was a real breakup, then the author might not be at fault. \n\nBut wait, maybe there were red flags. The author was in love, and the ex never returned those feelings. The ex's \"test\" seems manipulative. The author made their own decision based on the given information. If the ex wanted to stay friends, the author had the right to seek support for their self-esteem. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if the ex didn't truly want to break up, the author's actions could be seen as a betrayal. But that depends on whether the author had reason to believe the breakup was real. Since the ex was adamant, the author acted accordingly. \n\nThe key point is the author's assumption. If the ex's actions and words led the author to believe the relationship was over, then the author isn't in the wrong. The ex's test was a deception, which is on the ex. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
