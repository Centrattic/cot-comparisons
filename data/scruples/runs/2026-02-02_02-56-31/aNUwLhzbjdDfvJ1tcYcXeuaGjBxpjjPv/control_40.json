TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where there's a breakup followed by ambiguity.\n\nThe author was in a relationship where the guy ended things, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, used Tinder and slept with others, thinking they were no longer a couple. Then the guy revealed it was a test to see if the author would stay faithful, and he's now angry and blocked her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong by sleeping with others after the breakup? The guy's action of breaking up and then testing her seems manipulative. The author thought they were over, so her actions were based on that assumption. However, the guy's friend mentioned the breakup was a test. That complicates things because the guy never clearly communicated his intentions. He didn't stay in touch just as friends as he claimed but instead set up a test. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she acted on his stated decision to be friends, so she wasn't in the wrong. The guy's actions were deceptive. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she believed they were no longer a couple, sleeping with others isn't inherently wrong. The guy's manipulation is the bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
