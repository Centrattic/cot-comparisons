TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She then started dating others on Tinder, thinking they were no longer a couple. Later, she found out that the breakup was a test, and he wanted to see how she'd react. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The man claimed to have broken up, which led her to believe the relationship was over. She then started sleeping with others, which he now objects to. But he later admitted it was a test, so maybe the breakup wasn't real.\n\nBut from her perspective, she thought they were broken up. She had every reason to believe the relationship was over when he said it was. She sought to rebuild her self-esteem by dating others, which is a common reaction after a breakup. However, he used the breakup as a test, which is a bit manipulative because he never clarified his intentions. \n\nThe question is about whether she's wrong. If the breakup was genuine, then she's not wrong for moving on. But if it was a test, maybe she should have questioned the breakup more. However, she relied on his statement that they were just friends. \n\nThe man's actions might be more questionable because he didn't communicate his true intentions and then judged her actions. She can't be expected to stay single if he's leading her on. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on his initial declaration of the breakup.\n"
