TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with new people after their partner ended the relationship. The partner later admitted it was a test to see if the user would stay faithful. \n\nFirst, the key point is whether the breakup was real. If the guy said it was a breakup, then technically they were no longer in a relationship. In that case, the user isn't in the wrong for moving on. But the twist is the guy's friend says the breakup was a test. However, if the user wasn't aware of this test and acted based on the breakup, then it's the guy's fault for not being honest.\n\nThe user thought they were single, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. Cheating usually involves being in a committed relationship. If the guy's test made them still technically in a relationship without the user's knowledge, that's deceptive on his part. The user's actions were based on the information they had. So the user isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
