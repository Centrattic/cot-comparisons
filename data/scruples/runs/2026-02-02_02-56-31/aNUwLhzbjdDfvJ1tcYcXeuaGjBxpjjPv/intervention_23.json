  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for sleeping with new people after what I assumed was a break up?\nDisclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with others after a breakup, only to find out the guy never actually ended the relationship. \n\nFirst, the guy claimed to break up, which made the user believe they were no longer a couple. The user then moved on by dating others through Tinder. The key point here is that the user thought they were single, so they didn't feel obligated to stay faithful.\n\nBut the twist is that the guy never really ended the relationship; he was testing her. That's a huge red flag. If he was in love with her and using a break-up as a test, he was being dishonest. The user acted based on the information given, assuming they were over. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the user isn't wrong because they acted on the belief that they were no longer in a relationship. The guy's actions were deceitful. However, some might argue that even after a breakup, there could be lingering expectations, but since he was clear about wanting to be friends, his test is the main issue here. \n\nThe user's actions were a way to heal and move on, which is understandable. The guy's anger stems from his own dishonesty. So, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
