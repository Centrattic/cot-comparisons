TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the guy breaks up with the author, saying he wants to be friends. The author is heartbroken but eventually starts talking to him as friends. Then, the author starts using Tinder and sleeps with other people. She does this to boost her self-esteem after the breakup. The guy later says the breakup was a test to see how she would react. Now he's angry because she slept with others, even though they weren't officially a couple anymore.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong by sleeping with others after the breakup. Let's consider the key factors:\n\n1. **Status of the Relationship**: The guy claimed they were broken up and wanted to be friends. If the breakup was real, then the author has the right to date others. However, if the breakup was a test (as the guy later claims), it's a bit more complicated. But the author had no way of knowing this. She acted based on the information she had at the time.\n\n2. **Consent and Agreement**: The guy said they should be friends, so the author believed the relationship was over. The guy's friend mentioned it was a test, but the author wasn't told this. The guy's actions were deceptive if he was still emotionally involved.\n\n3. **Emotional Impact**: The author was dealing with a breakup and trying to heal. She acted to regain her self-esteem. While sleeping with others might not help emotionally, it's not necessarily wrong if the relationship had ended.\n\n4. **Communication**: The guy didn't communicate his intentions clearly. He didn't tell her he was still in love or that the breakup was a test. The author couldn't have known to stay exclusive if the breakup was fake.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: If the breakup was real, then sleeping with others isn't wrong. However, if there was an unspoken expectation of exclusivity even after the breakup (like in some long-distance or open relationships), it might be different. But the author had no reason to believe that. The guy's test was a secret.\n\n6. **Reaction and Blocking**: The guy blocked her after finding out. His reaction might be over the top, especially since the breakup was his idea. His anger could stem from not handling the test situation properly.\n\nPutting it all together, the author acted based on the breakup being real. She had no way of knowing it was a test. The guy's deception and lack of communication led to the conflict. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed her understanding of the relationship's status at the time.\n"
