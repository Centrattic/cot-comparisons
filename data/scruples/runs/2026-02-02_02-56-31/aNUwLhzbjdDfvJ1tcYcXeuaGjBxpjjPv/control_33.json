TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, thinking it's over, starts seeing other people on Tinder to boost their self-esteem. But then the guy says the breakup was a test to see how the author would react. Now he's mad and blocked them.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The guy said they were just friends, so the author believed the relationship was over. In that case, it's reasonable for the author to move on and date others. However, the guy later admitted he was still in love and used the breakup as a test. That's a bit manipulative because he didn't communicate his true feelings upfront.\n\nThe author's actions: sleeping with others after the breakup (as they believed it was over) shouldn't be wrong if the relationship was truly ended. But the guy's actions were deceptive. He pretended it was over to test the author's loyalty. So the fault might not be on the author's side. \n\nBut there's another angle: sometimes people stay in a breakup's emotional space even if they're told it's over. However, the author was told to be friends, so they had a right to move on. The guy's test was a bit of a trap. The author didn't know it was a test, so they acted based on the information given. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's actions were misleading. Therefore, answer B.\n"
