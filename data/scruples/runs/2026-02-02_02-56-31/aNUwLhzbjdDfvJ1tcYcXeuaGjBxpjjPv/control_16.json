TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the guy (let's call him G) told the author (let's call her A) they should just be friends after a breakup. A was heartbroken but eventually got used to it. Then, to boost her self-esteem, she started dating others through Tinder and had sex with some people. She thought it was okay because they weren't together anymore. Now, when G found out, he got angry because he was actually doing a \"test\" to see where she'd be, and he's still in love with her. He blocked her and won't talk.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong?\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are communication, consent, and the nature of the breakup. When G said they should be friends, did he actually mean it? If he didn't communicate his intentions clearly, that's on him. The author thought they were over, so acting on that might be valid. But maybe there's ambiguity here. He didn't state the breakup was a test, so the author had no way of knowing. Therefore, her actions were based on the information she had.\n\nAlso, relationships are about mutual understanding. If G didn't clarify his intentions, he can't later expect her to act a certain way based on his secret test. The author's actions were in response to what she believed was a real breakup. So, unless there was explicit agreement on the terms of the breakup, she wasn't wrong.\n\nAnother angle: sleeping with others after a breakup is a personal choice. If the ex didn't specify any rules after the breakup, she's not obligated to follow any unspoken rules. G's anger stems from his own hidden agenda, not from clear communication. Therefore, the responsibility lies more with G for not being upfront about his test.\n\nTL;DR: The author acted based on the breakup being real, which wasn't clearly communicated as a test. So she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
