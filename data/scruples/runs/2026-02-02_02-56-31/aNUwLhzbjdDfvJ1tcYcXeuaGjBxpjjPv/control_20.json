TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate as strongly. He broke up, saying they should be friends. The author, heartbroken, moved on and started sleeping with others after getting on Tinder. Then he \"tested\" her by breaking up, and when she slept with others, he got angry. Now he's refusing to talk to her.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the timeline and the intentions of both parties. The guy initially broke up, claiming it was for the best. The author, believing they were no longer a couple, started seeing others. But the guy later admits he broke up as a test to see if she'd stay loyal. \n\nNow, if the guy truly ended the relationship, the author isn't in the wrong for moving on. But if he never intended to break up and was just testing her, then maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, the author had no way of knowing it was a test. From her perspective, they were broken up. She's not obligated to stay faithful if they aren't in a relationship anymore. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the guy was still emotionally involved and didn't communicate clearly, perhaps he's at fault for the test. However, the author did start seeing others after the breakup, which is a common way people deal with heartbreak. \n\nThe main issue is communication. The guy's test was deceptive, which complicates things. But the author acted based on what she believed was the situation. So, is she in the wrong? If the relationship was genuinely over, then no. But if he was still in a relationship and just pretending to break up, then she's not at fault. \n\nIn real-life relationships, if someone breaks up, the other person is free to move on. The fact that he used a test instead of being honest is problematic. So the author isn't in the wrong because she made decisions based on the breakup he initiated, even if it was a test. Therefore, answer B.\n"
