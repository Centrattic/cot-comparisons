TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with new people following what they thought was a breakup. The guy later says it was a test to see what she would do, and he's angry now.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The guy called it off, said they should be friends, and she believed it. She was heartbroken but accepted it. Then she used Tinder and slept with others. She thought they were no longer a couple, so she wasn't cheating. But he claims it was a test and expected her to stay loyal as a girlfriend. Now he's mad and blocked her.\n\nThe key points here: Did she know he was still considering them as a couple? He didn't clarify that the breakup was a test. She acted on the assumption that they were no longer a couple. He later claims it was a test, which sounds manipulative. But in relationships, when someone says they want to break up and be friends, the other person generally moves on. If he didn't communicate his true intentions, she might not be at fault. However, if he clearly stated it was a test, maybe she should have known, but in reality, people can't read minds. So she acted in good faith based on his initial statements. The guy's anger over something he didn't set clear boundaries about could make him at fault. But she did move on, which is normal after a breakup. So I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
