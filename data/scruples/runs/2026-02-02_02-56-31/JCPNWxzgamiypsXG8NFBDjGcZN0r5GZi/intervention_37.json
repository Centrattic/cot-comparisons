Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user left their car parked at their parents' house while they were in Germany. A 16-year-old neighbor hit the car, and the parents and the kid's family thought it was okay to just let it go. The user came back to find the damage and is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, the kid causing damage without informing the owner is a key point. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're legally responsible. But here, the kid's parents and the user's parents chose to let it slide. The user is now being told to accept it by their parents and others. \n\nThe user's parents might have wanted to avoid conflict, but that doesn't mean they're right. The user is the actual owner of the car and has the right to know about the damage and seek compensation. The kid's family should have at least informed the car owner when they found out. The fact that they didn't tells the user that they might not be taking responsibility seriously.\n\nAlso, the user is being labeled as the asshole for asking for reimbursement. That's a red flag. If the kid is at fault, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to be compensated. The parents and others might not see the financial burden the user is facing, but that's part of the issue here. The user's reaction is justified because they have to pay for repairs they didn't cause.\n\nSo, the kid and their family are at fault for not informing the owner and not compensating them. The user is not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
