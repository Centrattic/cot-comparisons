Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were told about the incident, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and feel like they're being blamed for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're legally responsible for the damages. However, the parents were present and told the neighbors not to worry about it. That might have been a compromise, but does that absolve the kid's responsibility? The parents might have been in a position where they didn't want to involve the police or file a claim, so they might have informally resolved it. But the car owner wasn't consulted, which is a problem.\n\nNext, the author came back and found the damage. They feel wronged because they weren't informed and didn't get compensation. The neighbors might argue that they apologized and offered to pay, but the parents refused. But the author's parents might have made a decision that the author wasn't part of. Legally, if the car owner is the registered owner, they have the right to seek compensation, regardless of what the parents said. So the author could be justified in seeking reimbursement.\n\nThen, there's the social aspect. The neighbors might feel that the situation was resolved when the parents said it's okay, so the author is now overreacting. But the author didn't know about the incident until returning. Was there a communication issue? If the parents should have informed the author, then maybe they're at fault for not doing so. The author isn't at fault for not knowing. So the responsibility falls on the neighbor's family for causing the damage and not ensuring the actual owner was informed or compensated.\n\nThe kid is a minor, so the parents would typically be responsible for any damages. The parents might have said not to worry about it, but that doesn't mean the legal liability is gone. The author might have a right to pursue reimbursement since they're the owner. So in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. The neighbors and the parents might be responsible for not handling the situation properly with the actual owner. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
