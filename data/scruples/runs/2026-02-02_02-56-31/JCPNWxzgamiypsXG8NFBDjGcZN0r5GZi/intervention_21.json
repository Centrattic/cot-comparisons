Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user's car was damaged by a neighbor's kid while they were in Germany. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, and the parents didn't inform the user about the incident. Now the user is upset that no one told them and that there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, if someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the parents were present might complicate things. If they were the ones who told the kid not to worry about it, maybe they took responsibility, but the user is the actual owner of the car. So legally, the user might have a claim against the kid or his parents if they were negligent.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents and neighbors might be trying to avoid conflict, which is common in some cultures. However, the user is the one who has to pay for repairs. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but they didn't consult the user, who is the car's owner. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents might have dismissed it. \n\nThe user's main grievances are not being informed and not getting compensation. Is it fair for them to seek reimbursement now? Since the damage happened while they were away, they might not have been aware. The neighbors might have thought the parents could handle it, but the parents might not have realized the user would be the one footing the bill. \n\nIs the user overstepping by asking for compensation now? If the parents already resolved it by saying not to worry, maybe the user is in a bind. However, if the parents didn't have the authority to waive the user's right to compensation, the user is justified in seeking reimbursement. \n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're the victim of property damage and have a right to seek compensation. The neighbors might be responsible, but the parents' actions could be a factor. So the answer would be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
