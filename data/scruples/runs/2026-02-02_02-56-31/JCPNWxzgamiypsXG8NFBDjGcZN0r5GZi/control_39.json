Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and interacted with the kid and his parents, but the kid didn't pay for the damage. The author is upset because they weren't informed and have to pay for repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and social aspects here. Legally, if the kid caused damage, he's responsible. But since he's a minor, his parents would be liable. However, the author's parents told them not to worry about it, so maybe they let it go. The author is now upset because they weren't informed and have to cover the cost. \n\nSocially, when someone's family handles a situation and says it's okay, is the adult child expected to follow up? The author wasn't there, so maybe they didn't know what happened. The parents might have resolved it, but the kid offered to pay and the parents declined. But the author is the owner, so maybe they should have been informed. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting reimbursement? If the parents already resolved the issue, maybe they shouldn't push for more. But if the parents didn't inform them, maybe the author is justified in wanting compensation. It's a bit of a gray area. The kid is at fault for damaging the car and not informing the owner. The parents might have overstepped by not letting their son pay. The author isn't at fault for the accident, but maybe they are overreacting now because they weren't part of the initial resolution. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid's parents should have ensured the owner was informed. The author's parents might have assumed responsibility, but the author is the car owner. So the author might not be in the wrong to seek reimbursement since they weren't part of the initial conversation. However, if the author's parents already handled it, maybe the author is overstepping. It's a bit tricky. Legally, the author could have a case, but socially, if the parents let it go, maybe the author is seen as being unreasonable now. \n\nI think the key points are: the kid's fault, the parents' initial handling, and the author's right to know and seek compensation. The author isn't at fault for the accident, but maybe they are in the wrong for not being informed and now pushing for reimbursement when their parents didn't communicate. However, the author is the owner, so they should have been informed. The neighbor kid didn't inform the owner, so the author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation. So answer B.\n"
