Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1k damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, apologized, offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they weren't told and there's no reimbursement. The question is whether the author is the asshole for asking for compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and moral aspects. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. The kid was 16, so the parents have liability. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents dismissed it might mean they're not taking responsibility. Legally, the author could have a right to compensation, especially since the damage was done without their knowledge. They weren't there, so maybe the parents shouldn't have settled it without consulting the car owner.\n\nMoral responsibility: The author is being told they're overreacting, but they're the ones who have to pay for the repairs. The parents might have thought it's a minor issue, but the author is justified in wanting reimbursement. The kid didn't inform the owner, which is another point\u2014there's a duty to notify the owner about damages, even if you're fixing it. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The parents might have resolved it, but maybe the author's parents shouldn't have made that decision without their child's input. Also, the kid did apologize, but that doesn't remove the responsibility to pay for damages. The parents of the kid might be avoiding liability, which isn't fair.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents of the kid should have ensured compensation. The author is within their rights to seek reimbursement. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
