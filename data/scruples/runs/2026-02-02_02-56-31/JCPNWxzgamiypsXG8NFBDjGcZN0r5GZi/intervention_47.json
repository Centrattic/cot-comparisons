Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong because a neighbor kid hit their car while they were away, and now they're being told to just let it go. \n\nFirst, the kid is 16, so a minor. His parents were involved, and he offered to pay but their parents didn't want them to. The user's parents said not to worry about it. The user came back to find out about the damage and is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nLegally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. But in this case, the kid's parents might be to blame for not handling it. The user's parents didn't inform them, which might be a problem because the car owner has a right to know about the damage and any attempts to resolve it. \n\nThe user is being criticized by others for wanting compensation, but they're the ones who had to pay for the repairs. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The kid's family might be responsible, so the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents who didn't inform the user could be at fault for not passing along the information or ensuring the damage was covered.\n\nSo, the user's parents might have made a mistake by not telling them. The user is just seeking what's owed to them. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the responsibility lies with the kid's family, and the user's parents didn't inform them properly. The user isn't the asshole here for wanting to be compensated for their property damage.\n"
