Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the parent's house to address it, and the parents were told not to worry about it. The author comes back to find $1000 damage and is upset that no one told him and there's no reimbursement. People are saying he's the asshole for asking for money now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, if someone damages your property, they are responsible for compensation. The kid is a minor, so the parents would be responsible. However, the parents were present and told the author's parents not to worry about it. But the author wasn't there to make that decision. So even if the parents forgave the debt, the author is the car owner and might have a right to pursue compensation.\n\nSocially, people might think the author is overreacting because the issue was already resolved locally. But the author wasn't involved in that resolution. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but they didn't consult the car owner. The kid's family didn't inform the owner, which is a problem. The author is now facing unexpected costs, which is understandable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The kid and his parents caused the damage and didn't inform the owner. The author is seeking reimbursement, which is their right. The fact that the parents were told not to worry about it doesn't absolve the kid's responsibility, especially since the car owner wasn't part of that agreement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
