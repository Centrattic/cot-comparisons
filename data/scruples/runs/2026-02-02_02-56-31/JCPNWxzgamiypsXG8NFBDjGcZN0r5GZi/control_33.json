Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after their neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away.\n\nFirst, the facts: The kid was 16, backed into the car. He and his mom went to the parent's house. The parents downplayed it, said not to worry, and the kid offered to pay but was told not to. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. They're being told they're overreacting.\n\nSo, legally, if someone damages your property, they're usually responsible for the damages. The kid is a minor, so the parents might be liable. But in this case, the parents might have already resolved it with their own parents. The author's parents dismissed it, maybe to avoid conflict or hassle. But the author is the rightful owner, so their parents might not have the authority to waive the claim. \n\nEthically, the kid did something wrong, and the parents not informing the owner is an issue. The author is being blamed for asking for reimbursement, which seems unfair. The parents' decision to not involve the owner might be the problem here. The author isn't at fault for seeking compensation they're owed. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
