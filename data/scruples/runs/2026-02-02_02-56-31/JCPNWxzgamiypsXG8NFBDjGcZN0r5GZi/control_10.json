Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The kid's parents went to the author's parents, the kid apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and have to pay $1,000 for repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if someone damages your property, they are responsible for covering the costs. Even if the owner wasn't present, the person who caused the damage should be liable. The fact that the kid is a minor might mean his parents are responsible, as they've already acknowledged the damage and the kid's fault.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents decided not to pursue reimbursement, but the owner is now out of pocket. The parents might have a reason, maybe wanting to be kind or avoid conflict, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the person who caused the damage. The author is upset because they ended up paying for something they didn't do.\n\nThe neighbors were in communication with the parents, but the author was the actual car owner. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but they didn't consult the owner. The author has a right to know and to seek compensation since they're the one who has to pay for repairs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're seeking reimbursement for damages caused by someone else. The neighbors, especially the kid's parents, might be at fault for not informing them. The parents of the author might have made a decision without considering the owner's perspective. The author isn't overreacting because they have a right to be compensated for their loss. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
