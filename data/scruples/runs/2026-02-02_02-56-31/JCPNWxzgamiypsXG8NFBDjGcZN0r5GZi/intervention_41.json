Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for wanting reimbursement after a neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away. The scenario is that the kid hit the parked car, and the parents and the user's parents dismissed it, saying not to worry. Now, upon returning, the user is upset about the lack of communication and compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, when someone causes damage, they're typically responsible for covering the costs. However, in this case, the user wasn't present, and their parents let the situation be handled without them. The kid and his parents offered to pay but were told not to worry. The user's parents might have acted out of kindness or to avoid conflict, but now the user is out of pocket.\n\nEthically, the user's frustration is valid because they weren't informed. The kid's family might be responsible, but the user's parents might have resolved it without consulting them. The user's right to know about the damage and to be involved in the resolution is a key point here. \n\nLooking at community opinions, some might say the user's parents handled it, so the user shouldn't interfere. Others might argue the user has the right to seek compensation since they're the car owner. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay but the situation was dismissed could mean there's room for the user to now step in, even if it's been a while.\n\nPossible issues to consider: Statute of limitations, the credibility of evidence (did the user's parents see the damage? Were there witnesses?), and the dynamics between the families. If the user's parents are against pursuing it, the user might face social backlash, but legally, they might have a case. \n\nIn many places, the person who caused the damage is liable, regardless of who knows about it. So the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. However, if the matter was already resolved by the parents, the user might need to navigate that carefully. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, not in the wrong) because the user is the rightful car owner and has a right to compensation for damages caused by another party. The fact that their parents let it go doesn't negate their right to know and be compensated.\n"
