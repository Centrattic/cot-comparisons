Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong because their neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away. The kid and his parents came to their parents' house and offered to pay, but the parents waved it off. Now the user is upset because they had to pay $1,000 in damages and no one told them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for the damages. Even if the parents tried to fix things on the spot, the user might still have a right to seek compensation. But since the user's parents told them not to worry, maybe there's an agreement there that's complicating things.\n\nThen there's the social angle. The user's parents and neighbors might see it as a resolved issue, but the user feels wronged because they're now out the money. The user is upset that no one informed them and that they have to cover the costs. The question is whether the user is overstepping by asking for reimbursement after their parents already dismissed the matter.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the kid caused the damage, so the user should be compensated. However, if the user's parents accepted the apology and the offer to pay but declined it, maybe the user's parents are in a position where they don't want to pursue it. The user is now in a bind because they have to pay and might feel their parents didn't act in their best interest.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The user's parents didn't inform them about the incident, which is a big issue because the user is the rightful owner and should be informed. 2) The kid admitted fault and offered to pay, so the user has a right to seek reimbursement. The fact that the parents dismissed it doesn't absolve the kid's responsibility. The user isn't the asshole here because they're being reasonable in asking for compensation after the fact, especially since they weren't involved in the initial resolution.\n"
