Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's car was damaged by a neighbor's 16-year-old kid while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house, the kid apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the user is upset because they weren't informed and there's no reimbursement. They're being told they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, the kid caused the damage. He's a minor, so his parents are legally responsible. Even though the kid offered to pay, minors can't be held legally accountable beyond their parents' supervision. The parents should have taken responsibility here. But the user's parents dismissed the issue, which left the user out of the loop. \n\nThe user's main points are not being informed and not getting compensation. They weren't there, so it's reasonable for them to expect to be informed. The fact that the other parents didn't inform them is a problem. Also, the parents who dismissed the issue might have acted without considering the user's perspective. \n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. They're not the one who caused the damage. The responsibility lies with the kid's parents, and the user's parents might have made a mistake by not handling it properly. The user is within their rights to seek compensation, especially since the parents didn't address it. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the user isn't in the wrong. They're the victim here. The kid's parents and their own parents handled the situation poorly. The user is justified in wanting to be reimbursed for the damage they didn't cause.\n"
