Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, and the parents said not to worry about it, even though the kid offered to pay. The author returns to find $1000 damage and wants reimbursement but is told they're the asshole for even asking.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The kid caused damage, so normally, the responsible party (or their parents) would cover the costs. However, the parents already told the kid to not worry about it. The author wasn't there, so maybe they didn't have the chance to decide. But the parents had the authority to represent them? Or does the car owner have the right to seek compensation regardless?\n\nIn many places, if someone damages your property, you can claim compensation. Even if the parents forgave the debt, maybe the author as the car owner still has a right to seek payment. But if the parents already resolved it without the owner's knowledge, maybe they can't be blamed for not informing. But the author didn't know about the incident until returning, so there's a lack of communication. The parents might have been in a position to handle it, but the author is now left with the cost. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to have their parents handle such situations? Since they were living with their girlfriend in Germany, maybe they trusted their parents to manage their belongings. But the parents might not have the authority without the owner's consent. Also, the kid's family might be at fault for not informing the actual owner. The author is upset they have to pay for something they weren't told about. \n\nThe key points: The damage was done, the responsible party's parents were involved, and the parents forgave the debt without the owner's consent. The author is now left with the cost. Legally, the owner can pursue reimbursement even if their parents tried to handle it. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation. The parents might have overstepped, and the kid's family should take responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
