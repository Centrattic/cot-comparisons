Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were in Germany. The parents of the kid were there, and when the accident happened, they went to the author's parents' house. The kid offered to pay, but the author's parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author comes back, finds out about the damage, and wants reimbursement. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when someone damages another's property, they're responsible for the damages. The kid is a minor, so the parents would be responsible. However, the author's parents initially dismissed the issue, possibly to avoid conflict. But the car is the author's, so they have the right to seek compensation.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author's parents might have wanted to keep things friendly, but the author now has to bear the cost. The kid and his parents knew about the damage and offered to pay, but the author's parents turned down the compensation. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and has to pay for repairs. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The author wasn't informed about the accident, 2) The parents of the kid were present and discussed it but didn't inform the actual car owner. Legally, the author might have a right to claim the damages since they're the owner. Ethically, the author isn't at fault. The kid's parents should have informed the car owner regardless of the parents' initial dismissal.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're entitled to compensation for their property damage. The neighbors' parents should have communicated with the actual owner and covered the costs.\n"
