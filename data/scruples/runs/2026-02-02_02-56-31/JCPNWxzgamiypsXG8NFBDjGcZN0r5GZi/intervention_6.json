Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong because a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away, and now they want reimbursement but everyone says they're the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, the facts: The kid was 16, hit the car, his parents and the user's parents were involved. The kid offered to pay, but the user's parents said not to worry about it. The user returns to find damage and wants compensation. The question is about whether the user is in the wrong for seeking reimbursement.\n\nSo, legally, if someone causes damage to your property, they are generally responsible for covering the costs. The user's parents might have forgiven the debt, but the user is the car's owner. The parents might not have the authority to waive the kid's responsibility. However, in some cases, if the parents accepted the apology and said not to worry, maybe there's an assumption that the matter was resolved. But the user wasn't consulted, which is a key point. They had to pay for repairs out of pocket and feel wronged.\n\nSocially, the neighbors might think the user is overreacting because the parents let it go. But from the user's perspective, they're being asked to absorb a $1k cost without input. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The user's parents might have acted without consulting their child, which complicates things. \n\nThe user isn't at fault for seeking reimbursement since they were the rightful owner. The neighbors not informing them about the damage is also an issue. So, the answer would be that the user isn't in the wrong (B). They're justified in seeking compensation for the damage caused to their property, especially since they weren't involved in the initial resolution.\n"
