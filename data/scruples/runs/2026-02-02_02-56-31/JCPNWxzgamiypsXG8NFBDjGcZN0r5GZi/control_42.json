Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the car was damaged, the owner wasn't informed, and the person at fault didn't actually pay. The author is returning and finding out about the damage, which is making them angry. The parents told them to forget it, and others are saying the author is overreacting.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are responsibility for the damage, communication, and whether the author's reaction is justified. The kid did hit the car, which is their fault. The parents of the kid were involved and even offered to pay but were told not to worry about it. However, the car owner (the author) wasn't informed at all. The author is now having to pay for repairs and is upset about it.\n\nIn terms of legal liability, if the kid caused the damage, the parents might be liable since the kid is a minor. But since the parents didn't inform the car owner and instead told their son not to worry about it, that might be an issue. The author is the victim here, right? They didn't cause the accident, they weren't informed, and they're now having to cover the costs. The fact that their parents dismissed it doesn't absolve the responsible party.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. They had no control over the situation, and the person who caused the damage should be responsible for the costs. The parents dismissing it might have been a mistake, but the author has a right to be upset. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
