Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) after a neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away. The key points here are that the car was parked at their parents' house, the kid hit it, and the parents told them not to worry about it. The user is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: When someone's property is damaged, the responsible party is usually liable. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be responsible. The user's parents dismissed the issue, but the user is now facing the financial hit. Legally, the user might have a right to reimbursement since the damage wasn't their fault.\n\nThen there's the social angle. The parents and neighbors might be trying to avoid conflict, especially since the kid apologized. But the user is the one out $1,000. The user isn't being unreasonable to seek compensation, especially since they weren't there to handle it themselves. The parents' decision to let it go might be well-meaning, but it's not considering the user's financial burden.\n\nEthically, the responsible party should cover the damage, regardless of the user's absence. The fact that nobody informed the user adds to the problem. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting to be reimbursed after being kept in the dark. The neighbors might feel they resolved it with an apology, but financially, it's a different story.\n\nConsidering all angles, the user isn't the asshole. They're trying to get compensation for an accident they didn't cause. The neighbors and parents handled it without considering the user's position. So, the answer should be B.\n"
