Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 16-year-old neighbor hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and told the kid and his mother not to worry about it, even though the kid apologized and offered to pay. Now, the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The car was parked at the author's parent's house. When the damage occurred, the author was in Germany, so they couldn't have been present. The neighbor kid hit the car, and the parents (the author's parents) interacted with the kid and his mom. The parents decided not to pursue reimbursement, even though the kid offered to pay. Now the author is coming back and finding out about the damage with no compensation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's parents handled the situation and let it go, but the author feels wronged because they weren't informed and there's a financial loss. The parents are advising to forget it, and others think the author is overreacting.\n\nLegally, the kid is a minor, so the parents might be responsible for any claims. But since the author's parents didn't pursue it, maybe there's a problem. The author is the victim here, but the parents might have waived their right to compensation. However, the author is the car owner, so they might have a right to seek reimbursement. But since their parents were acting on their behalf, maybe they can't now go back and demand it.\n\nEthically, the kid did cause damage and offered to pay, but the parents (the author's parents) said it's okay. The author is now upset because they weren't informed. There's a conflict between the parents' decision and the author's right to know about the damage to their property.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the author's parents had the authority to waive the author's right to compensation. If the car is the author's property, the parents might not have the right to decide that on their behalf, especially if the author wasn't present. However, in some jurisdictions, parents might manage the affairs of their child, but the author is an adult here (since they have a car and a girlfriend, likely over 18), so their parents might not have the authority.\n\nSo, the author isn't at fault for wanting reimbursement. The kid is responsible for the damage, and the parents (the neighbor's) should cover it. The author's parents might have overstepped by not informing their child and letting the matter drop. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole. The answer would be B, No.\n"
