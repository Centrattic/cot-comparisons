Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car when they were abroad, and the parents apparently told them not to worry about it. The author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. They're being called the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The kid is 16, which is a minor, so the parents are legally responsible. The damage is about $1,000. The parents went to the author's parents, who said not to worry. The kid offered to pay, but the parents didn't make them. Now the author is returning and finding out about the damage, and they want reimbursement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are legal responsibility, communication, and expectations. Since the kid caused the damage, they're liable. However, the parents might have resolved it on their own. But the author's parents didn't inform them, which is a problem because the author is the owner of the car. The parents might have thought it was a minor issue, but the author is now dealing with the financial burden.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the kid is at fault, the parents (as guardians) should cover the costs. The fact that they were told not to worry about it doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The author has a right to seek compensation for their property damage. The neighbors might have thought it was resolved because the parents said so, but the author wasn't involved in that decision. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting reimbursement. The neighbors might be in the wrong for not informing the actual owner and not compensating them.\n\nBut sometimes people might think that since the parents said not to worry, it's their decision. However, the author is the one who has to pay for the repairs. So the neighbors might have acted in good faith but neglected to communicate properly. The author isn't the asshole here because they're standing up for their property. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
