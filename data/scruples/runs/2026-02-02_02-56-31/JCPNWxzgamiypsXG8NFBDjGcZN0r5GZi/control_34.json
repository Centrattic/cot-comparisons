Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents were present and told the kid's parents not to worry about it, so no reimbursement was given. The author is upset about not being informed and not getting compensated. Others think they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are: the car was parked at the parents' house, the kid hit it, the parents handled the situation without informing the author, and the author is now seeking reimbursement. \n\nLegally, when someone's property is damaged, the responsible party is usually liable for damages. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable. The parents of the kid were upset about being asked to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. The author didn't know about the incident until returning. \n\nEthically, the author's parents might have resolved the issue without consulting the car owner, which is a problem because the car belongs to the author. The parents had the authority to act on their behalf, but maybe they shouldn't have without involving the owner. \n\nThe author is upset because they weren't informed and have to pay for repairs. The kid did offer to pay, but the author's parents declined. So the author's request for reimbursement comes after the fact. But the kid's parents might not have been informed properly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid's parents might be responsible for their child's actions. If they were told not to worry, but the car owner is now seeking compensation, there's a conflict. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement since they're the rightful owner. The parents handling it without their input is an issue. The kid did admit fault and offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. So the author's actions are justified. \n\nThe answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The kid caused damage and should reimburse, and the parents should have informed the car owner.\n"
