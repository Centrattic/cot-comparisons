Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for seeking reimbursement after their neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away. The key points here are: the kid hit the car, the parents were informed, the kid offered to pay but the parents waved it off, and now the user is upset because they weren't told and didn't get compensated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Generally, if someone causes damage to another's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the parents were present but didn't inform the car owner is a big issue. Legally, the owner has the right to know about the damage and to seek compensation, even if the parents initially accepted the apology and refused payment.\n\nSocially, the user's parents might have wanted to keep the peace, but by not informing the user, they might have overstepped. The user is the rightful owner and should be involved in decisions about their property. The kid's family might have a responsibility to cover the repair costs, especially since the damage wasn't their property.\n\nThe user's frustration is valid because they're now facing unexpected expenses. The fact that others are calling them an asshole for seeking reimbursement suggests a conflict between personal responsibility and community harmony. However, the user isn't wrong for wanting to be compensated for their loss. The parents' decision not to inform them doesn't negate the kid's liability.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting reimbursement. The main issue is the lack of communication from the parents and the kid's family not following through on their initial offer. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, you're not in the wrong).\n"
