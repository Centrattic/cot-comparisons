Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad. The damage is $1,000, but the parents didn't inform them and also didn't seek reimbursement. Now, the author is upset because they find out about the damage and feel they should get compensation, but everyone else thinks they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are responsibility for the damage and the actions taken (or not) after the incident. The kid was 16, which is a minor, so typically the parents would be responsible for any damages caused by their child. The parents did approach the author's parents, and the kid offered to pay, but the author's parents let it slide. The problem arises when the author returns and is out the money, but no one informed them. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the parents not informing the car owner might be an issue. If the damage occurred, the rightful owner should be notified, especially if there's a possibility of insurance claims or reimbursement. However, since the parents didn't inform them, maybe there's a lack of communication. \n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in being upset because they're out of pocket and the damage wasn't their fault. The neighbors might not think they need to compensate because they were told not to worry. But legally, the person at fault (the kid) and their parents should be responsible. The author's parents might have overstepped by not passing on the information.\n\nBut the question is about the author's fault. The author didn't do anything to cause the damage. They were away, and their parents handled the initial situation. The issue is whether the author is wrong for seeking reimbursement now. Since the parents didn't inform them, maybe the author is in the right to be upset. However, if the parents already resolved it (even if they shouldn't have), maybe the author's pushing for reimbursement now is complicating things. But the neighbors shouldn't have ignored the damage and not compensated. \n\nSo, the author isn't at fault for the damage. The problem is the parents not informing them and the neighbors not reimbursing. The author is justified in seeking reimbursement because the damage was caused by someone else's negligence. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
