Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong when their neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1000 in damage. The kid and his parents went to their parents' house and apologized, saying not to worry about it. Now the user is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key points here are the responsibility of the person who caused the damage and whether the user's actions are justified in seeking reimbursement.\n\nThe kid is 16, so a minor. The parents were involved in talking to the user's parents. The user's parents told them not to worry, but the user is the owner of the car. The user argues that they should be compensated for the damage. The neighbors didn't inform them. \n\nLegally, when someone damages another person's property, they are usually responsible for covering the costs, regardless of who owns the property. Even though the user's parents spoke to them, the responsibility for the damage should fall on the person who caused it. The parents might have decided to cover it themselves, but the user, as the car owner, has a right to be informed and seek compensation. \n\nThe neighbors not informing the user is a problem. The user wasn't part of the conversation, so their lack of knowledge isn't their fault. The user is now expected to pay for repairs they didn't cause. The neighbors' decision to let the user's parents handle it doesn't absolve them of liability. \n\nThe user's reaction is understandable. They\u2019re being told they're the asshole for seeking reimbursement, but they\u2019re the one bearing the financial loss. The neighbors might have a moral obligation to compensate, even if they resolved it with the parents. However, if the parents accepted their apology and dismissed it, there might be a question about whether the user should have known. \n\nBut the user wasn't consulted, and the parents might not have the authority to waive that. So the user's anger is justified. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the person who caused the damage is responsible, and the user has the right to seek reimbursement. The neighbors not informing them and dismissing the issue without involving the owner is a mistake. The user isn't the asshole here.\n"
