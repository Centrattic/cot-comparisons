Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after a neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away. The key points here are that the kid hit the car, his parents were involved in the aftermath, and the user's parents didn't inform them or seek compensation.\n\nFirst, the legal angle: In many places, if someone damages another's property, they're responsible for repairs. The kid is a minor, so his parents might be liable. However, the user's parents didn't report the damage, which could affect insurance claims. If they didn't involve the police, there might be no official record, making it harder to pursue compensation.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The user is upset about not being informed and having to pay for repairs. The neighbors apologized and offered to pay, but the user's parents dismissed it. The user feels wronged because they're now out $1,000. Others think the user is overreacting because the issue was resolved locally without formal action.\n\nBut wait, the user wasn't present. Their parents handled the situation. Maybe they felt it was best to avoid conflict, especially with a minor. However, the user's right to know about the damage and seek compensation isn't negated by their absence. The parents might have the authority to handle it, but the user is the car owner and has the right to know.\n\nOn the other hand, if the parents already accepted the apology and said not to worry, maybe they intended to cover it. But since they didn't, the user is stuck. It's a gray area. Legally, the at-fault party should compensate, but since the user's parents didn't pursue it, maybe the user is expected to let it go. But morally, the user isn't wrong for wanting compensation, especially since they didn't have a say in how their parents handled it. The neighbors might be at fault for not informing the car owner directly. So the user isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. Answer B.\n"
