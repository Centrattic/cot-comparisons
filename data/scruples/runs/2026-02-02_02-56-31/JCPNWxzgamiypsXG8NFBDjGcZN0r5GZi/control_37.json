Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their car was damaged by a neighbor's kid while they were away. The kid hit the car, and his parents and the author's parents were involved. The author's parents told the kid not to worry about it, but the author is upset because he wasn't informed and isn't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable since he's a minor. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was told not to worry about it complicates things. Legally, the author might still be entitled to compensation even if his parents forgave the debt. But the author's parents might have already resolved the issue, which could affect the author's right to seek reimbursement now.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents might have a good relationship with the neighbor and didn't want to escalate things. They might have thought it was a minor accident and chose to let it go. The author, however, is now dealing with the financial burden and feels wronged. He's upset because he wasn't informed and now has to pay for repairs. The neighbors might feel that the matter was settled when the author's parents said to forget it. But the author wasn't part of that conversation, so he's only now finding out.\n\nThe key points are: Was the author properly informed? Did his parents have the authority to forgive the debt on his behalf? Legally, if the car is the author's, the parents might not have the right to absolve the debt without his consent. But socially, family might have handled it with the neighbor's family to avoid conflict. The author is now in a position where he might need to pursue the matter legally if he's not satisfied with the resolution.\n\nThe Reddit community often looks at these from both angles. The author isn't at fault for the accident, but he might be in the wrong if he's going against his parents' decision to let it go. However, if the parents didn't have the authority to forgive the debt, he's justified in seeking compensation. The answer hinges on whether the author's parents could legally absolve the debt and the social dynamics of not wanting to create a rift between families.\n\nIn many cases, the author would be within his rights to seek compensation. However, the social pressure from family and neighbors might make him the target of criticism for not letting it go. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't at fault for the accident and has a right to be reimbursed for his damages unless legally released from that claim. The parents might have made a decision without considering the owner's wishes, which complicates the situation.\n"
