Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were away. The user's parents were there and met the kid and his mom. The kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the user is back and upset because they have to pay $1000 for repairs, and everyone's telling them they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages your property, they are legally responsible for the damages. Even if the owner wasn't present, the person who caused the damage should cover the costs. The user's parents might have thought they were handling it by saying not to worry, but maybe they shouldn't have dismissed the responsibility so quickly.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The user's parents might have wanted to avoid conflict, especially since it's a teenager. But the user is now facing the financial burden. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, which shows some responsibility, but the parents didn't follow through. The user is the one who has to deal with the repair costs, so they might feel wronged.\n\nAnother angle: the user's parents were acting as representatives while the user was abroad. If they accepted the apology and dismissed the compensation, maybe they were overstepping. The user is the owner of the car, so they have the right to decide about compensation. If the parents didn't check with the user before dismissing the payment, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the kid and his parents might have thought it was resolved because the immediate owner (the parents) said it was okay. But the actual owner (the user) wasn't consulted. So there's a communication breakdown here. The user isn't the one who said it's okay; they were away and didn't know. They're now being blamed for pushing for reimbursement, but they have a right to seek compensation for their property.\n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. They're being told to accept the situation without compensation, but they have a valid claim. The fault lies with the person who caused the damage and the parents for not ensuring the user's interests were protected. So the answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
