Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor kid, 16 years old, hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the parent's house, apologized, and the parents said not to worry. The author comes back to find the damage, no one told him, and he's upset because he's not getting reimbursed. People are saying he's the asshole for asking for money.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The kid caused damage. Normally, when someone damages your property, you'd expect them to pay for repairs. Even if the parents resolved it with the author's parents, does that mean the author can't claim it later? The author's parents might have said not to worry, but that doesn't mean the responsibility is lifted from the kid's family. The problem here is that the author wasn't informed and now has to pay for something that wasn't his fault.\n\nBut wait, maybe the parents were the ones who accepted the apology and said it's okay. So if they already resolved it, is the author now going back and asking for money after the fact, which could be seen as unfair? Or was the resolution not valid because the actual car owner wasn't involved? The parents might have been the ones at the scene, but the car belongs to the author. So maybe they shouldn't have made a decision without consulting the owner. That's a key point. The parents might have overstepped by not informing the author about the damage and the arrangement made.\n\nAlso, the kid offered to pay, but the parents declined. If the parents are the ones who said not to worry, then maybe the author is in a tough spot. But the author is now affected financially, and the people around him are telling him not to ask for reimbursement. But legally, does the kid's family have a responsibility to pay? In many places, if a minor causes damage, their parents are liable. So even if the parents said it's okay, the author might still be entitled to compensation. However, if the parents already accepted the apology and the kid's offer to pay, but chose not to make the kid pay, maybe the author is now out of luck. But that depends on whether the author's parents had the authority to waive that right.\n\nAnother angle: the author's parents might have been too lenient, but the main issue is the lack of communication. The author wasn't told about the incident until he returned. That's a problem because the parents should have informed him. So if the parents didn't tell him, maybe they're also at fault. But the question is about the author's actions. The author is upset about the damage and asking for reimbursement, which is understandable. The people saying he's the asshole might be because he's upset about not being informed and now seeking payment after the fact. But if the parents already handled it, maybe he shouldn't have to deal with it again. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the kid did hit the car, so he's responsible. The parents might have made a mistake by not informing the author. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting compensation, especially since he wasn't part of the initial resolution. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The kid and his parents are responsible, and the author's parents might have been wrong not to inform him and let the matter drop without resolution.\n"
