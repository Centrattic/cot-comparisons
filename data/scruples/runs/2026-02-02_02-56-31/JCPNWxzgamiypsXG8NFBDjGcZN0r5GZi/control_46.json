Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor kid hit the author's parked car while the author was away. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and maybe offered to pay, but the parents told them it's okay. Now the author comes back, finds out about the damage, and is upset because he wasn't told and isn't getting compensation. People are saying he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If a minor causes damage, their parents might be legally responsible. The kid is 16, so a minor, so the parents could be liable. The author might have a right to seek compensation through insurance or the parents. But maybe the parents already handled it by saying not to worry. But the author didn't know, so he wasn't part of the conversation.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents might have resolved it informally, thinking it's a good deed to let it go. But the author is now out $1,000, which is a lot. The kid offered to pay, but the parents declined. So maybe the parents felt it's better to just let it go, but the author is the actual owner and might have a right to decide. \n\nThe author's parents said not to worry, but that's their decision, not the author's. If the author is the one who owns the car, he might have the right to seek compensation. The fact that he wasn't informed is a problem because he wasn't there. Maybe the parents should have told him what happened. But they might have thought it's better to avoid conflict. \n\nAlso, the kid hit the car, which is a common scenario. But if there's a policy that you should inform the car owner, even if it's your parents' house. Maybe the kid didn't know who was responsible since the car owner was away. But the parents are the ones who lived there, so maybe they had a duty to inform the owner. \n\nSo, legally, the author might have a case, especially if the parents didn't have the authority to waive the claim. Socially, the neighbors might have thought it's a small repair and not worth it, but $1,000 isn't that small. The author is upset because he wasn't informed, which is valid. \n\nI think the key points are: the kid caused damage, the parents of the kid were involved but didn't inform the actual owner, and the author is now seeking reimbursement after being in the dark. The parents might have overstepped by not telling the author, and the kid's parents might be legally responsible. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting compensation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
