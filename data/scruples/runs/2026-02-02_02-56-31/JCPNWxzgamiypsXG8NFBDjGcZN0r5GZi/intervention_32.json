  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA The neighbor kid hit my parked car while I was abroad and caused $1,000 worth of damages. Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to their parents' house, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the user's parents told them not to worry about it. Now the user is coming back and finds out about the damage, and they're upset because no one told them and there's no compensation. The user is being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and social aspects. Legally, in many places, if someone causes damage to your property, they are responsible for it. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable. The user's parents might have the right to accept or decline compensation, but in this case, they told the neighbor's family not to worry about it. But the user is the owner of the car, so even if the parents accepted that no compensation would be given, the user might still have a right to seek reimbursement. \n\nSocially, this is more complicated. The user's parents might have wanted to avoid conflict or thought it was a minor issue. But the user is the one who's out $1000. The kid did offer to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The user is now upset because they weren't informed, which is understandable. The key points are: ownership of the car (user), the parents' role in the initial resolution, and the kid's responsibility.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong because the person who caused the damage should be held accountable. The parents might have made a decision without considering the user's perspective. The user is within their rights to ask for compensation. The neighbors might have a case for not being informed at the time, but the kid's offer to pay wasn't accepted. Therefore, the user isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
