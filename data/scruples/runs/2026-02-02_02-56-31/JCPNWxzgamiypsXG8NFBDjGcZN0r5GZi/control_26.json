Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house and the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they are legally responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The author's parents might have dismissed the issue, but the actual owner of the car is the one who incurred the damage. So legally, the author should be the one to seek compensation, not the parents.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author's parents handled the situation by letting it go, but the author is the one who has to pay for repairs. If the kid admitted fault and offered to pay, but the parents waved it off, the author has a right to be upset because they're out of pocket. Not informing the car owner about the damage could be seen as neglecting their responsibility to protect their property.\n\nAlso, the author's parents might have thought they were being kind by not making a big deal, but that doesn't absolve the kid's responsibility. The author's reaction is about being out $1,000, which is significant. People around them think they're overreacting, but they're the ones who actually lost money. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting reimbursement. The fault lies with the kid and his parents for causing the damage and not following through on compensation. The author's parents might have mishandled the situation by not informing the author and not ensuring the damage was covered. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
