Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong here. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to their parents' house, the kid apologized, offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry. Now the user comes back to find out about the damage, no one told them, and they want reimbursement. The question is whether they're the asshole for asking for compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, if someone causes damage to your property, they're liable to pay for it. Even if they're a minor, their parents are usually responsible. But here, the parents might have already interacted with the user's parents and resolved it without the user's knowledge. However, the user wasn't present and didn't have a say in the matter. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The user's parents told the other parents not to worry about it, but maybe they shouldn't have done that without consulting their child. The user is now out $1,000, which is a significant amount. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The user is upset because they have to foot the bill without prior notice.\n\nEveryone around the user thinks they're overreacting, but they're the one bearing the financial loss. The key points here are: the user wasn't informed, the damage wasn't their fault, and the responsible parties (the kid's parents) were made aware but no compensation was given. The user is asking for what's owed to them, not being greedy. \n\nSo, legally, the kid's parents should cover the damages. Ethically, the user's parents might have overstepped by resolving the issue without the user's input. The user is justified in seeking reimbursement because they were unaware and now have to pay. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
