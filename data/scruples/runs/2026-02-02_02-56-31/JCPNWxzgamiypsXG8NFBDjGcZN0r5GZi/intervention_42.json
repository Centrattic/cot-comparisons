Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation. Their car was damaged by a neighbor's 16-year-old kid when they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the user is upset because they weren't told and there's no reimbursement. Everyone's telling them they're the asshole for asking for money.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal responsibilities. If the kid is 16, he's a minor, so his parents would be legally responsible. The parents did know about the damage and the kid admitted fault. Typically, when someone is responsible for damage, they should cover the costs. The parents saying not to worry about it doesn't absolve them of responsibility, especially if the owner wasn't there to agree. The user wasn't informed, so they couldn't have waived the claim.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The user is angry about the financial loss and the lack of communication. The parents and neighbors might think it's better to avoid conflict, but the user is the one facing the costs. It's not about being a bother; it's about rightful compensation. The parents might not realize that they can't make the user give up their claim without their consent.\n\nAlso, in some places, there are laws about minors causing damage. The parents as guardians are liable. The user has a right to seek reimbursement unless they personally forgave it, which they didn't know about. The neighbors might have thought the parents could handle it, but legally and ethically, the cost should be covered.\n\nSo putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate claim here. The answer should be B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
