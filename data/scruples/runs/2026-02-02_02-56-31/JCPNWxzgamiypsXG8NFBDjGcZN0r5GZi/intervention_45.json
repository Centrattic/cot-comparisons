Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after their neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away. The kid hit the car, and the parents and the kid went to their parents' house. The parents told them not to worry, but the user is upset because they had to pay $1000 and no one told them. The community is divided, with some saying the user is the asshole for asking for reimbursement, but the user feels wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. In many places, if someone causes damage, they're responsible for it. The kid is a minor, so the parents are responsible. The parents might have resolved it by telling their son not to worry about it, but the original owner (the user) wasn't informed. The parents might have assumed they were handling it, but the user is now out of pocket. \n\nMoral responsibility: The person who caused the damage should compensate the owner. The parents might have tried to resolve it by having their son pay, but they didn't communicate with the user. So the user isn't informed until they return. Is the user in the wrong for asking for compensation? Probably not, because they were the victim. The parents should have informed them and arranged for payment. However, the user's parents might have told them to forget it, which complicates things. But the user is the one who has to cover the cost. \n\nCommunity's take: Some might say the user is being unreasonable because the kid apologized and the parents handled it. Others would say the user is justified in seeking reimbursement. Legally, the responsible party (the kid's parents) should cover the damage. The user isn't wrong for seeking what's owed to them. So the answer would be B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
