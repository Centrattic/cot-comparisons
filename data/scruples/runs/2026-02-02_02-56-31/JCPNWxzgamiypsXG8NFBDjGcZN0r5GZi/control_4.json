Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their car while they were away. The parents were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the original owner comes back, finds out about the damage and is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation. The question is if he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for covering the damages. Even if the car was parked on someone else's property (like the parents' house), the responsibility for the damage would still lie with the person who caused it. The parents might have been there, but the kid is the one who caused the accident. So legally, the kid's family should be liable.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The owner wasn't informed, which is a problem. They had to come back and find out about the damage. The parents might have thought it was a small issue, but $1,000 isn't trivial. The kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The original owner is now being blamed for being upset about not getting compensation. That doesn't seem fair. People usually expect to be reimbursed for damages they don't cause.\n\nAlso, the fact that the owner wasn't there adds another layer. They had no way of knowing immediately, so the neighbor's family should have informed them. Hiding the incident and not communicating is part of the problem here. The owner is justified in seeking reimbursement because they're the rightful owner of the car and the damage affects them directly.\n\nLooking at the responses from the parents and others, they seem to be dismissing the owner's feelings and financial loss. The owner is in a position where they have to pay for repairs they didn't cause, which is unfair. The kid's family had the opportunity to resolve it when the incident happened but chose not to, leading to the current conflict.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking what's fair and legal. The neighbor's family and others are in the wrong for not informing them and dismissing their request. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
