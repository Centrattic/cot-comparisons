Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents to resolve it, but the parents let it go. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. They're being told they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the kid is a minor, so the parents would be responsible if there's liability. The parents might have the responsibility to cover the costs since they're the guardians. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents didn't inform the car owner is a problem. The author didn't have a chance to negotiate because their parents already dismissed it.\n\nEthically, when someone is responsible for an accident, they should inform the owner and discuss compensation. The parents might have handled it without involving the owner, which is a bit of a breach of trust. The author is being told to accept it, but they're the ones who have to pay for the damages. \n\nThe author isn't wrong in seeking reimbursement. They were the victim here, and it's reasonable to expect that if the incident happened on their property or involved their car, they should be informed. The parents might have overstepped by handling it without the owner's input. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be compensated. The answer should be B.\n"
