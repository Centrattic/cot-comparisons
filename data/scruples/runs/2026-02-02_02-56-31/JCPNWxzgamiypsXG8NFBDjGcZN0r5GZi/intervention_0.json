Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong when a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damages. The kid and his mom went to the parent's house to talk, and both the kid and his parents offered to pay, but the user's parents said not to worry. Now the user is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, if a minor causes damage, the parents are legally responsible. So even if the kid offered to pay, it's the parents' responsibility if the kid can't cover it. The user's parents might have dismissed the issue, but the user is the actual owner of the car and the one who has to pay for repairs. \n\nThe user is arguing that they should be the one to decide whether to accept reimbursement or not, since they're the car owner. Legally, they might have a right to seek compensation, but maybe the parents felt that since they were the ones approached, they had the authority to handle it. However, the user wasn't informed and now has to deal with the financial loss. \n\nSocially, the neighbors might view the parents' dismissal as a resolution, especially if the kid apologized. But the user is the one who's out the money. The key points here are communication and responsibility. The user didn't know about the incident, so their parents didn't inform them. Also, the kid's family might have intended to cover it but the user's parents waved it off. \n\nThe user is upset because they're expected to swallow the cost, and their parents are suggesting they forget it. The neighbors might not have a legal obligation if the user's parents let it go, but from the user's perspective, this was their property and they should have been the ones to decide. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication. The user was abroad and their parents didn't tell them about the incident, leading to the user not having a chance to address it. Legally, the user might be able to claim compensation if the kid's family is responsible, unless there was a prior agreement. But if the user's parents already accepted the apology and refused compensation, the neighbors might not be legally liable anymore. \n\nHowever, ethically, the user's parents should have informed their child about the damage. The user is now in a position where they're being blamed for \"overreacting\" despite being the one who has to pay. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, you are not in the wrong) because the user is the rightful owner of the car and the ones who should have been informed. The neighbors caused the damage, even if it was a minor, and their parents should have ensured the user was made aware and that compensation was arranged if possible. The user's parents might have let it slide, but that doesn't mean the user should bear the cost without knowing. The key here is that the user wasn't informed, so they couldn't take action. The neighbors and their parents might have a responsibility to communicate and resolve the matter with the actual car owner.\n"
