Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after their neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and parents did approach their parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the user is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and are being told they're the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, the kid was at fault for damaging the car. The parents of the kid tried to handle it but were told not to worry. But the problem is that the car owner (the user) wasn't aware of the damage until returning. The user's parents might have thought it was sorted, but they didn't consider that the owner might have a claim against the kid's insurance or need reimbursement. \n\nSince the kid is a minor, the responsibility usually falls on the parents. The fact that the kid offered to pay suggests they acknowledged fault. However, the user's parents might have accepted the apology in good faith, but that doesn't absolve the other party from liability. The user is now out of pocket because their parents didn't inform them. \n\nBut the user's main issue is not being informed and not getting compensation. The user isn't at fault here because the damage was caused by someone else's negligence. The parents might have made a decision without consulting the user, leading to this situation. \n\nThe user's demand for reimbursement is reasonable, given that they're the one who incurred the cost. The kid's parents might have insurance, so the user should consider filing a claim. However, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation. The main issue is that the user's parents didn't communicate properly, but the user isn't responsible for that. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
