Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid's family came over, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they weren't told and there's no compensation. The parents and others think the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the car was parked at the author's parent's house, the accident happened while the author was away, the kid and his parents were involved at the time, but the author wasn't informed. The parents dismissed it, but the author is now seeking reimbursement.\n\nLegally, when someone damages another person's property, they are usually liable for damages. However, if the parents of the kid took care of it by accepting an apology and waiving any claim, maybe the author can't do anything. But the author wasn't there; they're the actual owner of the car. The parents might not have the authority to waive that on behalf of the author. So the author could argue that they were the rightful party to decide about compensation.\n\nBut in terms of social norms, maybe there's an expectation that if the parents were acting as the representatives, they could handle it. However, the author wasn't consulted and now has to pay for repairs. Is it reasonable to expect the kid's family to pay? If the kid is a minor, the parents would be responsible. But if the parents said it's okay, maybe the author's hands are tied. But if the parents didn't have the right to waive that, then the author isn't wrong to seek reimbursement.\n\nAlso, the author is upset that they weren't informed. The parents might have a responsibility to inform their child's family that the owner wasn't aware. However, the kid hit the car, didn't tell the owner, and didn't compensate. The author is now out of pocket. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the kid and his family caused damage, and the author is seeking compensation. The parents might have made a unilateral decision without consulting the owner. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking what's due. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
