Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. The situation is that their neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the user's parents to resolve it, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the user is upset because they had to pay for repairs and others think they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If someone's property is damaged, the person responsible is usually liable for repairs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable since he's a minor. The user's parents might have the authority to accept responsibility, but they didn't. However, the user is the car's owner, so maybe they have a right to pursue reimbursement even if their parents let it go.\n\nThen there's the issue of communication. The user wasn't informed about the incident. The parents might have decided to handle it their way, but maybe they should have informed their child that the car was damaged and that there might be financial consequences. The user is now facing unexpected costs because of someone else's negligence.\n\nSocially, the parents and neighbors might think it's a minor issue, but $1,000 is a significant amount for the user, especially if they're trying to save money for a visa. The user isn't overreacting; they're facing financial loss. The neighbors might not have the user's financial situation in mind.\n\nThe user's parents might have tried to avoid conflict, but by not informing the user, they may have left them in a tough spot. The user is now being blamed for seeking compensation, but they have a right to expect that someone else covers the damage they caused.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid caused the damage, so the parents should take responsibility. The user's parents might have been wrong to not inform them or handle the matter properly. The user isn't at fault for wanting to be compensated for damages they didn't cause.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
