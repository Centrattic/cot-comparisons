Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's car was damaged by a neighbor's 16-year-old kid when they were away. The kid and his parents went to the user's parents and offered to pay, but the parents waved it off. Now the user is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the kid caused the damage. At 16, they're a minor, but parents are usually responsible for their kids' actions. The parents approached the user's parents, which makes sense since they're the emergency contacts. The user's parents might have decided to handle it without involving the son, maybe to protect his record or to avoid conflict. But the user isn't the one who was in the situation; they were abroad. They didn't know about the damage until returning. The user's claim is that they should be compensated because they're the ones who have to pay for the repairs.\n\nThe user's parents told them to forget it, but that doesn't mean the user is at fault. The user is the one who owns the car and is now facing financial loss. The neighbors, especially the parents, knew about the damage and had the chance to address it but didn't. The user isn't overreacting; they're dealing with an unexpected expense. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
