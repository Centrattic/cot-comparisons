Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's kid (16 years old) hit their parked car while they were away in Germany. The parents of the kid were told about the incident, and the kid offered to pay, but the user's parents said not to worry about it. Now, the user is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and the others think they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if someone damages another person's property, they are legally responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the kid was 16 is a factor, but since he offered to pay, it's possible he's being held accountable as a minor. The parents might be liable if their child caused the damage. However, the user's parents accepted the kid's apology and said not to worry about it, which might have been an agreement to let it go. But the user wasn't consulted here, which is a problem.\n\nNext, the user's perspective: They were not informed about the damage until they returned, and now they're out $1,000. The key issue here is whether the user has the right to seek compensation after their parents already dismissed the matter. The user's parents might have acted without considering the financial impact on the user, who is the rightful owner of the car.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, the user's friends and family think they're overreacting. But the user is justified in feeling wronged because they weren't involved in the initial decision to forgive the debt. The kid and his parents might be responsible for the damages, especially if the user's parents didn't have the authority to waive the claim on the user's behalf.\n\nLegally, the user might still have a right to reimbursement if the initial agreement (forgiveness) wasn't valid without their consent. However, depending on local laws, if the parties involved agreed not to pursue compensation, the user might be out of luck. But morally, the user has a right to expect that their property damage is addressed, especially when they weren't part of the initial resolution.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The user isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement after being kept in the dark. The mistake might be that their parents didn't consult them, but the user's anger is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
