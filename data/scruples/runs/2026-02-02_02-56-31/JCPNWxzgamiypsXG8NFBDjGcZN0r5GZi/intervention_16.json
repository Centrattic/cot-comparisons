Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user left their car parked at their parents' house while in Germany for three months. A 16-year-old neighbor hit the car, and the parents and the kid's parents said not to worry about it. Now the user is upset about the $1,000 damage and wants reimbursement. Everyone around them thinks they're overreacting. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they're liable. The kid is 16, so his parents might be legally responsible for his actions. The user's parents might have a duty to inform the owner (the user) about the damage. They didn't tell the user, which could be a problem because the user is the rightful owner. The parents might have acted without considering the user's rights.\n\nEthically, the parents might have wanted to avoid conflict, but by doing so, they let the user face the financial burden alone. The kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the user's parents dismissed it. The user is now in a situation where they have to pay for damages caused by someone else. It's reasonable for the user to seek compensation. The fact that no one informed them adds insult to injury.\n\nThe neighbors might not have a legal obligation if they thought the user's parents were the car's owners, but the car is the user's. The parents didn't have the authority to waive the user's right to compensation. The user isn't being unreasonable here; they're seeking what's legally and morally right. The neighbors and parents dismissed the issue, which is why the user is upset. So, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
