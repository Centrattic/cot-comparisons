Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after their neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were abroad. The key points here are that the kid hit the car, his parents and the user's parents were involved, and the user's parents told them not to worry about it. The user is now upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, the kid was 16, so a minor. His parents were involved in the situation. When the incident happened, the kid's parents were upset about filing a claim, and the user's parents dismissed it. The user returned to find the damage and is seeking reimbursement. Others are telling the user to let it go.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the parents of the minor might be responsible for any damages caused by their child. However, in this case, the user's parents downplayed the situation, maybe to avoid conflict or insurance issues. But the user isn't the one who dismissed the claim; their parents did. The user is now facing the financial loss because they weren't informed. \n\nEthically, the person who caused the damage should compensate the victim. The user isn't at fault here. They were abroad and didn't have control over the situation. The fact that the kid's parents were involved and possibly agreed to pay but didn't follow through adds to the user's side. \n\nHowever, the user's parents might have agreed not to pursue it, which could affect the situation. But the user is the one who's out the money and is seeking reimbursement. It's possible that the user's parents didn't communicate properly with their child's parents. \n\nConsidering all that, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the kid's parents to resolve the damage. The user is justified in seeking compensation. The answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
