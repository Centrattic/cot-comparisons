Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The car was at the author's parents' house. The kid and his parents went to the parents after the incident, the kid apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now, when the author comes back and finds out about the damage, they're upset and want reimbursement. The parents and others think the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your car, they're responsible for the damages. The kid is 16, which is a minor, so his parents might be legally responsible. The fact that the kid offered to pay and the parents dismissed it doesn't necessarily mean they can avoid liability. The author, as the car's owner, has a right to seek compensation for the damage done to their property. \n\nThen there's the issue of notification. The author wasn't told about the damage. If the parents had the authority to waive compensation, maybe, but as a general rule, the car owner is the one who has the right to decide on compensation. The parents might have agreed to let it go, but that doesn't necessarily mean they can do that on the author's behalf. The author isn't the one who was present and might not even know about the incident until returning. \n\nAlso, the parents' decision to let it go could be their own, but the author is the one who has to pay for the repairs. The parents might not own the car, so they don't have the right to decide that the author shouldn't be compensated. The author is in a tough spot because they had no control over the situation while they were away. \n\nLooking at the community's perspective, some might say the author is being too harsh because the kid apologized and the parents didn't want to involve authorities. However, the author isn't at fault for the damage. The responsibility lies with the person who caused the accident. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking what is rightfully theirs. The kid and his parents should cover the damages, even if the parents initially dismissed it. The author's parents might have overstepped by not informing their child's parents that they should handle the compensation. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
