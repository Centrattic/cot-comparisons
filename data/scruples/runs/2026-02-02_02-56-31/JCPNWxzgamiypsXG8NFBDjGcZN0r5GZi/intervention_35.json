Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after their neighbor's kid hit their car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house, apologized, and the parents let it go, but now the user is upset they didn't get compensation.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, when someone damages another's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid was 16, so his parents might be legally liable as guardians. But the parents were told not to worry, so maybe the user's parents forgave the debt? But the user wasn't consulted, which is a problem because they own the car.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The parents might have resolved it without informing the user, but the user is now facing unexpected costs. The parents might not have realized the user would be upset. The neighbors might not have known to contact the user directly since he was abroad. But the kid admitted fault and offered to pay, so maybe there's a moral obligation to reimburse the user.\n\nThe user's parents said not to worry, but that decision was made without the user's input. The user is the one who has to pay for repairs, so their parents shouldn't have made that call. The neighbors might have thought the issue was resolved because the parents said so, but the user is the car owner, so they should have been informed.\n\nReddit's take often considers both sides. The user isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation since the damage wasn't their fault. The neighbors might be in the wrong for not informing the actual owner. The parents' decision to let it go without consulting the user could be the issue here. So the answer might be B, but it's a bit complicated. However, the user is not the asshole here because the responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage.\n"
