Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that a 16-year-old neighbor hit the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents to talk, and the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages another's property, they are legally responsible. The kid is a minor, so his parents might be liable. Since the kid admitted fault and offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it, the author might have a claim against the kid's parents. However, if the parents already resolved it by saying not to worry, does that affect the author's right to claim?\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author's parents chose not to pursue reimbursement, which is their right. But the author is now out $1000 and feels wronged. The neighbors might feel they were already dealt with, but the author wasn't consulted. Was the author's parents' decision valid without his consent? If the car is the author's property, he should be involved in decisions about compensation.\n\nAnother point: the kid hit the car, didn't inform the owner, and left. Even if the parents were informed, the owner (author) has the right to seek reimbursement. The parents might have let it go, but the author's rights as the car owner are separate. The author isn't overreacting if he's responsible for the damage cost.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The kid and his parents are responsible. The author's parents shouldn't have dismissed the issue without consulting him. The author has the right to seek compensation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
