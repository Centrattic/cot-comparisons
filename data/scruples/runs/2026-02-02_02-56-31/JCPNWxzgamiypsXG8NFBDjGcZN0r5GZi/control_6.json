Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a neighbor kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1000 in damage. The parents were there and let the kid and his mom know about it but didn't tell the car owner. Now, when the owner returns, he's upset about not being informed and not getting compensation. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The kid is 16, so a minor. He hit the car, and his parents were involved. The parents and the author's parents met, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. The owner wasn't informed, which is a problem because he's now out $1000. The user is asking if the owner is wrong to want reimbursement.\n\nLegally, the kid is a minor, so his parents would be responsible for any damages. If the parents agreed that the kid would pay, but the owner's parents didn't inform the owner, that complicates things. The owner's parents might have let the matter drop, but the owner is now the one who has to pay for repairs. \n\nMoral-wise, the owner is the victim here. The kid caused damage, and the responsible parties (the parents) should cover the costs. The owner's parents might have wanted to handle it without involving the owner, but that's not fair to the owner. The owner isn't at fault for the accident, nor for wanting to be reimbursed. The fact that he wasn't informed is a key point here. The parents might have thought they could handle it, but the owner is now out money.\n\nI should consider if the owner's reaction is reasonable. He's upset about not being told and not getting compensation. Others think he's overreacting, but he's the one with the financial loss. The kid and his parents are responsible, so the owner isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
