Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong when their neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house and offered to pay, but the parents let it go. Now the user is upset about the $1,000 damage and the lack of communication.\n\nFirst, the kid hit the car. That's a straightforward liability situation. Typically, when someone causes damage, they're responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the parents were present and the kid apologized but were told not to worry might complicate things. However, the owner of the car (the user) wasn't there to make that decision. So maybe the parents overstepped by dismissing the claim without consulting the user.\n\nAlso, the user didn't know about the incident until returning. The neighbors didn't inform them, which is a problem. Even if the parents forgave the debt, the user is the one who has to pay for the repairs. The neighbors should have at least communicated with the actual car owner.\n\nNow, considering the responses from the community saying the user is the asshole, maybe there's a cultural difference in Germany regarding such incidents. Sometimes in some places, people might let minor things go to avoid conflict. But $1,000 isn't minor. The user is being blamed for expecting reimbursement, but the kid is at fault for causing damage. The parents might have resolved it, but the user is the one bearing the cost without prior knowledge.\n\nSo, the user's main points are: they weren't informed, and the responsible party didn't compensate them. The neighbors' side is that they tried to resolve it with the parents, who let it go. Legally, the responsible party (kid) should cover the damages unless the owner (user) waives it. Since the user didn't waive it and wasn't informed, they have a valid claim. The parents might have given up their right to claim, but the user's parents can't decide that for them. So the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
