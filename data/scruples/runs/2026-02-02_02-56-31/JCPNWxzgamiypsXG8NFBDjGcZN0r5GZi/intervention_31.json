Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's car was damaged by a neighbor's 16-year-old kid while they were in Germany. The kid and his parents went to the user's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry. Now the user is upset because they weren't informed and have to cover the $1k repair.\n\nFirst, the kid caused the damage. At 16, he's a minor, so the responsibility typically falls on his parents. The parents were involved in the scene, so maybe they were handling it. The user's parents said not to worry, which is their choice, but the user is the actual car owner. The user is being blamed for overreacting, but the main issue is that the damage wasn't reported to them. \n\nLegally, the person responsible for the damage should compensate the car owner. Even if the parents resolved it with the kid's family, the user has a right to know and to be reimbursed. The fact that the user's parents dismissed it doesn't mean the user can't seek compensation. It's about who owns the car and who is responsible for the damages. So, the user isn't wrong for wanting reimbursement. Answer B.\n"
