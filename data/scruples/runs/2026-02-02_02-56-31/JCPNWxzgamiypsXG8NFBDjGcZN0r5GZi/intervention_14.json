Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's car was damaged by a neighbor's kid while he was away. The kid and his parents went to the user's parents to address it, but the parents let it slide. Now the user is upset because he wasn't informed and isn't getting compensation. People are saying he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, the kid was at fault for hitting the car. Even though he apologized and offered to pay, the parents were told not to worry about it. The user's parents might have resolved it on their own terms, but the user isn't part of that dynamic. He's the car owner, so he's the one who should decide about compensation, right?\n\nBut the parents might have a relationship where they didn't want to burden the other family, especially since the kid was a minor. Maybe they thought it was a minor accident and didn't want to involve their son in legal stuff. However, the user is now facing the financial hit. If the parents didn't inform him because they thought they handled it, that's a problem. They should have checked with him before making any decisions.\n\nThe user isn't overreacting because he's the one who has to pay. It's reasonable to expect that the person responsible for the damage covers the cost, especially when he's the sole owner. The parents might have been trying to be kind, but they didn't consider his financial responsibility. So the user isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The answer should be B.\n"
