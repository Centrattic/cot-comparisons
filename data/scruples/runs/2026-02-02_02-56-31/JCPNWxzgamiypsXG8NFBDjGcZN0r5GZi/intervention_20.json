Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after their neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid is 16, and he and his mom went to the parents' house. The parents said not to worry about it, but the user is upset because they didn't get reimbursement and nobody informed them. The user is being told they're the asshole for asking for money now.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about responsibility. The kid caused damage, so he's legally responsible. The parents might have downplayed it, but the user didn't know. The user is now back and wants compensation. The parents and others think they're overreacting. But if the kid was at fault, he should pay. The fact that the parents said not to worry about it might have been to avoid conflict, but that doesn't absolve the kid's responsibility. The user didn't know about the damage until returning, so they couldn't have handled it themselves while away. The kid didn't inform them either. So the user is justified in seeking reimbursement. The answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
