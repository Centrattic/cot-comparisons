Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom, but the kid didn't inform the author and there's no reimbursement. The author is upset about the $1,000 damage and is being told they're the asshole for asking for money.\n\nSo first, I need to figure out if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The kid caused damage. Legally, when someone's property is damaged, the responsible party is usually liable for repairs. But here, the parents and the kid decided to just apologize and not pay. The author wasn't there, so they didn't handle it. Now, when the author comes back, they want reimbursement.\n\nIs the author wrong to ask for that? Well, the kid is 16. In many places, minors can be held responsible if their parents are involved. The parents were present when the incident happened and even spoke with the author's parents. The parents might be considered to have some responsibility here. The author's parents said not to worry about it, but the kid's parents might have agreed to cover the damage. But since the kid's parents didn't follow through, the author is now out of pocket.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The responsible parties are the kid and his parents. The author's parents might have made a mistake by not informing them or ensuring the kid's family covered the cost. The author has a right to be compensated for the damage. Saying they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement doesn't make sense because it's the person who caused the damage who should pay. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
