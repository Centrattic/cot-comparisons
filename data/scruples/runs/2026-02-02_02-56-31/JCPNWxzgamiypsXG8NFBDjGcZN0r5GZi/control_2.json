Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, resulting in $1,000 damage. The parents didn't inform the author and allowed the kid to just apologize without any compensation. The author is upset about not being compensated and is being told by others to let it go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the kid caused damage, the parents might be liable since they are responsible for their child's actions. However, in some jurisdictions, if the parents or the child admit fault and offer to pay, but the owner doesn't press charges, that might resolve the issue. But here, the kid and parents offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. So legally, maybe the author has a case but chose not to pursue, but ethically, did they overreact?\n\nEthically, the author is upset because they had to pay for the damage, and others are telling them to accept it. The key points are: the damage wasn't reported to the car owner, and no compensation was sought. The author's parents might have handled it, but they didn't inform the author. Was it wrong of the parents to not inform the author? That's unclear, but the author is upset because they were unaware.\n\nThe author's parents might have been trying to avoid conflict or maybe didn't realize the extent. But the author is now being criticized for seeking compensation. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting reimbursement. If the neighbor's kid admitted fault and the parents offered to pay, but the author's parents didn't follow through, the author might be justified in wanting that payment. However, if the parents already resolved it by not pressing charges, maybe the author is overstepping now.\n\nBut the author wasn't informed, which is a problem. The parents might have had the authority to handle it, but the author is the car owner, so they should have been informed. The kid didn't inform the owner, which is a red flag. So the author's anger is valid because they were kept in the dark and now have to pay. The neighbors dismissed the issue, so the author's reaction isn't unwarranted.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting compensation. The parents mishandled the situation by not informing them and not ensuring payment. The neighbors' kid didn't take full responsibility by actually paying. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
