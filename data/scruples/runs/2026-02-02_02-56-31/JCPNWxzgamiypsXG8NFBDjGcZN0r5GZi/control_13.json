Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away, and the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and didn't get any compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the kid is 16 might mean his parents are legally responsible since he's a minor. But the parents already apologized and maybe even offered to pay, but the author's parents told them not to worry. However, the author's parents might not have the legal authority to waive the claim, especially if the car is owned by the author, not the parents. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The kid caused damage and didn't inform the owner. The parents of the kid were upset about filing a claim, which could be because they don't want insurance rates to go up or to avoid legal trouble. But the original owner (the poster) isn't getting compensated. The parents might have resolved it on their own, but the poster is the actual owner of the car. The fact that they were out of town and weren't informed is a red flag. \n\nAlso, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the poster's parents dismissed it. Maybe the parents thought it was a small amount or wanted to avoid conflict. But the poster is now out $1000. Legally, they might have a right to reimbursement. \n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, if the owner of the car wasn't present and the damage was handled between the parents, maybe there's a lack of formal reporting. If the parents said it's okay, but the poster didn't consent, that could be an issue. The key points are: ownership of the car, whether the poster's parents had the right to waive the claim, and local laws regarding property damage. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the person who caused the damage should be responsible. The fact that they didn't inform the owner is a problem. The parents might have resolved it without the owner's knowledge, which isn't right. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
