Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that a 16-year-old neighbor kid hit their parked car when the owner was in Germany for three months. The kid and his mom went to the parent's house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. The author returns to find $1000 damage and is upset because no one told him and there's no compensation. Everyone says he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. Generally, if someone causes damage, they are responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The parents were informed by the kid and offered to pay, but the owner's parents dismissed it. But the actual car owner is the one who has to pay for repairs. The parents might have thought they could handle it, but the owner wasn't consulted.\n\nMoral aspect: The owner is the one who has to deal with the financial burden. The parents might have thought it's too much hassle, but they weren't the ones who owned the car. The kid's parents might be responsible here, especially since their child caused the damage. The author is within his rights to seek compensation for something that wasn't his fault.\n\nSocial norms: People often let minor incidents slide, but $1000 is significant. The neighbors might not want a conflict, but the author is just seeking reimbursement. The parents might have been trying to be kind, but they didn't consider the owner's position.\n\nPossible angles: The kid's parents might be at fault for not following through with the offer to pay. The author's parents might be wrong for dismissing the issue without consulting their son. The author is trying to get what's fair.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The kid's family is responsible, and the author is just seeking compensation. The answer should be B.\n"
