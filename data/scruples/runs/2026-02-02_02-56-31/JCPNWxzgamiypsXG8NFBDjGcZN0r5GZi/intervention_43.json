Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after their neighbor's kid hit their car while they were abroad. The kid and his family went to their parents, apologized, and the parents didn't press charges. Now the user is upset because they have to pay for repairs and others think they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, legally, when someone damages another's property, they're usually responsible for repairs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable. The user's parents didn't report it, but the owner (the user) was unaware. Since the car owner wasn't present, maybe the responsibility falls on the parents? But the user is the owner, so they have the right to seek compensation. \n\nBut the user's parents told the neighbors not to worry about it. Maybe they thought it was resolved? But they didn't consult the user. That's an issue because the user is the one who has to deal with the repairs. The parents might have overstepped by deciding for their child. \n\nMorally, the kid caused damage and should compensate. The parents not informing the car owner is a problem. The user isn't at fault for seeking reimbursement. They weren't consulted, so it's reasonable to expect the responsible parties to cover the costs. The neighbors might think it's settled because the parents said so, but the actual owner (the user) is the one affected. \n\nSo the user isn't in the wrong. They have a right to seek compensation since the damage was done to their property. The parents and neighbors might not have considered that in their decision. The answer is B.\n"
