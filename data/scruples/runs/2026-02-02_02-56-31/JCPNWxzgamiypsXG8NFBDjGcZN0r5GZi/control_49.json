Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is that the neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the kid caused damage intentionally or accidentally? The scenario says the kid \"backed up into\" the car, so it's probably an accident. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author's parents didn't inform them, so the author is now out $1000.\n\nLegally, if someone causes damage, they're responsible. But since the kid is a minor, the parents might be liable. However, the parents here chose not to pay, so the author might need to take legal action. But the author's parents, who were on the scene, said not to worry, which could complicate things. \n\nEthically, the author is upset because they were the victim and not compensated. The neighbors acted quickly, apologized, but didn't follow through financially. The author's parents might have been lenient, but that doesn't absolve the kid's family of responsibility. \n\nThe key points are that the author wasn't informed, which is a problem because they have the right to know about the damage to their property. Also, the kid's family didn't actually compensate them. The parents might have settled it themselves without the owner's input. So the author is justified in seeking reimbursement since they weren't part of the initial resolution.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
