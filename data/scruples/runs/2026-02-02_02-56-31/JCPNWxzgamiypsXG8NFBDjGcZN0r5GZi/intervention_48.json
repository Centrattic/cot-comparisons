Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents were there and talked to the kid and his parents. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry. Now the person is coming back and finding out about the damage, and they're upset that they have to pay for it. The family and others think they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone's property is damaged, the person responsible is typically liable for the damages. The kid is a minor, so his parents might be responsible. The parents of the kid were there and knew what happened. They were upset about being told not to worry, but the parents of the car owner said it's okay. But the kid did offer to pay, so maybe there's an implied agreement or a responsibility there.\n\nHowever, the car owner's parents might have forgiven the debt, but the person themselves wasn't even informed. If the parents had the authority to forgive the debt on behalf of the owner, then maybe the person isn't entitled to reimbursement. But if they didn't have that authority, then the person might still be able to claim compensation. \n\nAlso, in some jurisdictions, when a minor causes damage, their parents are legally responsible. So even if the parents said not to worry, the car owner might still have a legal right to seek compensation. However, if the car owner's parents accepted an apology and waived the claim, that might be considered a settlement, making it harder to pursue later.\n\nBut the person in question wasn't part of that conversation. They weren't there to accept or reject the offer. Their parents made the decision without consulting them. If the parents didn't have the authority to waive such claims, then the person could still go after the responsible party. \n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of the parents who found out about the damage. Did they have a duty to inform their child when they returned? Since the parents were the ones who interacted with the other party, maybe they should have relayed the information. The person wasn't there, so they couldn't have known unless informed.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if legally there's a settlement, ethically, the person who caused the damage might still feel it's right to compensate. The person in the situation is upset because they have to pay out of pocket. If the other party offered to pay but was told it's okay, maybe the ethical thing is to let it go, but the person feels wronged because they didn't get a say.\n\nSo, legally and ethically, it's a bit of a gray area. If the parents had the authority to forgive the debt, then the person might not have a case. If not, they could still pursue. But given that the kid and his parents offered to pay and the other parents dismissed it, maybe the person is overstepping by now demanding compensation after the fact. However, the person wasn't consulted, so maybe they're not in the wrong for wanting to seek reimbursement, especially if the initial dismissal wasn't valid.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the person isn't in the wrong. They were not informed, and the responsible party offered to pay, so expecting reimbursement isn't unreasonable. The answer would be B.\n"
