Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away. The kid's parents and their own parents didn't tell them about the damage. Now they're upset because they have to pay $1k and everyone thinks they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If someone causes damage to another person's property, they're generally responsible for covering the costs. Even though the kid is a minor, his parents might be liable since they were involved. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was told not to worry by the parents complicates things. \n\nThe user's parents chose not to pursue reimbursement, but the user feels wronged because they're the ones who have to bear the financial burden. The user's reaction is about being informed and getting compensation. Not being told about the incident is a problem. The parents might have handled the initial interaction, but the user wasn't part of the conversation since they were abroad. \n\nMoral responsibility: The person who caused the damage should be held accountable. The user isn't at fault here. The neighbors had the obligation to inform the car owner about the incident, especially since they could have covered the costs. The user's parents might have downplayed it, but that doesn't mean the responsibility is lifted. \n\nThe user is upset because they have to pay for something that wasn't their fault. The neighbors not informing them is a key point here. The user's reaction is valid because they were excluded from the situation and now have to face the financial consequences. \n\nConsidering the responses from others saying the user is the asshole, maybe they're not considering the user's perspective correctly. The user isn't being unreasonable in seeking reimbursement for a preventable accident. The neighbors' lack of communication and the parents dismissing the issue might be the real issues here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. The person who caused the damage should be held responsible, and the user has a right to seek reimbursement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
