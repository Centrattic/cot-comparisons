Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The kid and his parents were made aware of the damage, apologized, and maybe even offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. When the author returns, they find out about the damage and want compensation, but everyone is telling them to let it go.\n\nSo, the key points here: The car was damaged by the kid. The kid's parents were informed and possibly even offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because they have to pay for repairs and no one is helping. The question is whether the author is the asshole for seeking reimbursement.\n\nLegally, when someone causes damage, they're responsible for it. At 16, the kid is a minor, so the parents would typically be responsible. If the kid's family was informed and maybe even agreed to pay, then the author's parents dismissing it might have let that go. But the author is the car owner, so they have a right to seek compensation. The fact that they weren't informed when the incident happened might be an issue. If the author's parents had the chance to handle it but didn't, maybe they were wrong. But the author's responsibility is their own car. They have a right to be informed and seek compensation. The kid's family might be in the wrong for not informing the owner and not compensating. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're standing up for their property. The people around them (parents, neighbors) might be at fault for not handling it, but the author isn't.\n"
