Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid backed into their car while they were away. The kid and his parents went to the parent's house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author comes back to find $1k in damage and is upset because no one told them and there's no compensation. People are telling him he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects here. Legally, when someone is at fault in a car accident, they are typically responsible for damages. The kid is 16, so the parents might have some responsibility too. Since the parents were present and the kid offered to pay but was dismissed, maybe there's a question of whether the responsibility was waived. But just because the parents said not to worry doesn't mean the legal responsibility disappears.\n\nMoral-wise, the author is being told he's overreacting. But he's the one who had to pay for the damages. If he wasn't informed until he returned, that seems unfair. The parents might have handled the situation by accepting an apology and not pursuing payment, but the car owner's rights could still be valid. \n\nThe key points here are: the damage was done, the responsible party (kid) and his parents were informed, and the parents were advised against making a claim. However, the car owner has the right to seek compensation. If the parents dismissed the issue without the owner's consent, that's where the problem lies. The author isn't at fault for seeking reimbursement for damages caused by someone else's negligence.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents' actions might have been inappropriate in not informing their child's parents properly or not following through on the kid's offer to pay. The author has a legitimate claim here.\n"
