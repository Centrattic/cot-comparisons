Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents of the kid offered to pay but the author's own parents told them to let it go. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. People are saying they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The key points are: the kid caused damage, the parents tried to resolve it but the author's parents waved it off, and the author is now upset about the lack of compensation. \n\nLegally, if someone causes damage to your property, they're typically responsible for covering the costs. The kid's parents offering to pay but being told not to worry about it by the other parents might complicate things. But the author is the rightful owner of the car, so they have the right to seek reimbursement, even if their parents decided not to pursue it. \n\nHowever, the author wasn't present when the incident happened, and their parents handled the situation. The parents might have had good intentions to avoid conflict, but the author is now out of pocket. The neighbors did apologize and offer to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. So, the author's parents might have prevented a proper resolution. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid's family is at fault for causing the damage and not informing the owner. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation after finding out about the damage. The people telling them they're the asshole might not consider the financial burden on the author. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to expect compensation for damages caused to their property, especially when the responsible party offered to pay but the other parents interfered. The author's parents might be in the wrong for not supporting their child's right to seek reimbursement.\n"
