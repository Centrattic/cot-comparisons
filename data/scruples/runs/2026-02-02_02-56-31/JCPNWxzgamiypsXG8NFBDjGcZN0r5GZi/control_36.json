Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, offered to pay, but the parents declined and said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and feels everyone is being an asshole for not supporting them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break down the facts. The kid was at fault for hitting the car. The parents were informed by the kid and his mom, and they accepted the apology and refused compensation. The author wasn't told, which is a problem because they're the owner. \n\nThe key points here are legal responsibility and communication. Legally, the person who causes damage is usually liable, so the kid's family should cover the costs. However, the parents of the author might have resolved it without involving the author, but they should have at least informed them. The author's parents might have given a verbal agreement not to pursue compensation, but that could be problematic if the author is the owner. \n\nAlso, the author is the rightful owner, so they have the right to expect compensation. Even if the parents forgave the debt, they shouldn't have done so without consulting the author. The author's anger is justified because they're out of pocket $1,000. The neighbors, especially the kid's parents, should have contacted the author directly instead of just handling it with the author's parents. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is not the one at fault here. They're holding the responsible parties accountable. The kid and his parents are responsible for the damage, even if they tried to resolve it with the author's parents. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
