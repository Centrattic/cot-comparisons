Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and were approached by the kid and his mom. The kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the user returns to find the damage and wants reimbursement. Everyone says the user is the asshole for asking.\n\nHmm. The user's parents handled it by saying not to worry, which might be their decision. But the user is now out $1k. The key points here are responsibility and communication. The kid caused the damage; he's a minor, so his parents are legally responsible. The parents might have decided to cover it, but the user is the one who incurred the cost. The parents might have made a decision, but the user is the car owner. \n\nIn some places, if you're the car owner, you can still seek compensation even if someone else accepted on your behalf. But maybe the parents' acceptance of the apology and refusal to pursue it might complicate things. However, the user is the one who had the financial loss. The kid didn't inform the owner, which is a problem. \n\nLegally, the parents might not have the authority to waive the user's right to claim compensation. Even if they said not to worry, the user has the right to seek reimbursement. The user isn't the one who caused the damage, so they're not in the wrong. The kid and his parents are responsible. So the answer would be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
