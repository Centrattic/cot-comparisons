Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user's car was damaged by a neighbor's 16-year-old kid while they were in Germany. The kid hit the car, and the parents went to the user's parents' house. The user's parents told them not to worry about it, even though the kid offered to pay. Now the user is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and no one told them about the damage. They're asking if they're the asshole for wanting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, when someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be legally liable. The user's parents might have let it slide, but the user is the actual car owner. So, maybe the user has a right to seek reimbursement, even if their parents didn't pursue it. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The user's parents might have thought it was a minor incident, but the user is the one facing the financial burden. The kid and his parents were informed it was their fault, so they should know they're responsible. The user isn't the one who caused the damage, so they're not at fault. \n\nThe user is upset because they had to pay for something they didn't cause. The people around them say to let it go, but that doesn't mean the user is wrong. If the parents had the authority to waive the claim, maybe, but the user is the car's owner. So the user's request for reimbursement is reasonable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
