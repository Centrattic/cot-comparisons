Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user left their car parked at their parents' house while they were in Germany. A neighbor kid, 16 years old, hit the car. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house, apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. Now the user comes back, finds out about the $1,000 damage, and wants reimbursement. Everyone says they're the asshole for asking, but they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. But the parents already told the user's parents to not worry about it. So maybe they thought the issue was resolved? But the user wasn't informed. Did the parents have the authority to forgive the debt? The user is the car owner, so they should be the ones deciding whether to accept no compensation. The parents might have overstepped by not informing their child that the owner would need reimbursement. Also, the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. So the user's parents might have dismissed it, but the user is now left with the cost. \n\nEthically, should the parents have told the kid to pay? The user is the one who owns the car and has to deal with the damage. The parents might have thought they were being kind, but maybe they should have passed on the responsibility to their child. The kid did offer to pay, so maybe he intended to reimburse, but his parents blocked it. \n\nThe user is upset because they didn't get informed and now have to pay. The neighbors weren't informed they were responsible. The user isn't the one who hit the car, so they're not at fault. The problem is communication and the parents handling it without the owner's input. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the user isn't at fault. They're the victim here. The kid is responsible, but the parents might have miscalculated by not ensuring reimbursement. The user is justified in seeking compensation since they weren't involved in the initial resolution. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
