Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset about the $1,000 damage and feels nobody should have to pay for it. The community is saying he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal responsibility. Generally, when someone causes damage, they're liable for the costs. Even if the parents initially dismissed it, the fact remains that the kid was at fault. The parents might have tried to settle it informally, but if the author's parents said not to worry, maybe that's a problem. However, in many places, parents can't legally absolve their child's responsibility for damages. So the author might still be entitled to compensation.\n\nThen there's the aspect of being informed. The author wasn't told about the incident, which is a key point. If the parents didn't inform them, that's an issue. But the author's main point is that the kid caused damage and should pay, which seems justified. The neighbors might have thought it was resolved, but maybe they shouldn't have assumed that. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable because they're out of pocket. The neighbors' response of dismissing the issue might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's approach in seeking reimbursement after the fact could come off as confrontational, especially if the family had moved on. But legally and ethically, the parents who caused the damage should cover the cost.\n\nSo putting it together: The author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement since the damage was their fault. The neighbors should have informed the owner and handled the payment. The author's parents not informing them complicates things, but the responsibility lies with the at-fault party. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
