  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA The neighbor kid hit my parked car while I was abroad and caused $1,000 worth of damages. Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after a neighbor kid damaged their car while they were away. The kid hit the car when the owner was in Germany for three months. The parents were there and met the kid and his mom. The kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the user is upset because he's coming back to a damaged car and no compensation. People are telling him he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the user is wrong to want the neighbor to pay for the damage. Legally, if the kid caused the damage, he's responsible. But since he's a minor, his parents would be liable. However, the parents were told not to worry by the user's parents. The user's parents didn't inform him, so he's now facing the cost. The user is angry because he's out $1,000 and being told to just accept it.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the person who caused the damage should cover the costs. The fact that the user's parents told them not to worry doesn't absolve the kid's responsibility. But maybe the user's parents resolved the issue, so the user is overstepping by asking again. However, the user wasn't part of that resolution and wasn't informed. \n\nMoral perspective: The user is the victim. The neighbor's kid caused damage and offered to pay, but the user's parents dismissed it. Now the user is left with the cost. The user is justified in seeking reimbursement because he's the one who has to pay for the repairs. The neighbors should have informed him or arranged to pay when he returned.\n\nSocially, the user is being told to let it go, but that doesn't mean he's wrong. It's about fairness. The neighbors had the opportunity to inform him but didn't. The user's parents might have made a decision without his input, but he has a right to seek compensation for his property. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
