Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation involves their neighbor's 16-year-old kid damaging their car while they were away. The parents were present when the incident happened but were told not to worry about it. Now, the AITA is upset about the damage and wants reimbursement but is being told they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, if someone causes damage, they're usually responsible for compensating the owner. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. But since the owner's parents were there and said not to worry, maybe they waived the claim. But the problem is the owner wasn't informed. The parents who owned the car (AITA's parents) might have a right to make that decision, but the car belongs to the AITA, not them. Wait, does the car belong to the parents or the AITA? The story says the car is parked at the parents' house, but it's the AITA's car. So if the parents were acting as the owner's representatives, maybe they could forgive the debt. However, the AITA is the owner, so perhaps the parents shouldn't have agreed to that without consulting them. \n\nSocially, the neighbors might think the AITA is being harsh because they were told to let it go. But from the AITA's perspective, they weren't informed and now have to pay. The neighbors might have a point in that the kid apologized and the parents were already told not to worry. But the AITA is the one who suffered the financial loss. It's a classic case of \"don't ask, don't tell\"\u2014the problem was acknowledged but not resolved properly. \n\nSo, is the AITA in the wrong? If the parents had the authority to forgive the debt, then maybe not. But if the car is the AITA's, they should have been consulted. The neighbors might not be at fault if they were misled by the AITA's parents. The AITA's parents might have overstepped by not informing their child about the ownership. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid caused the accident, the parents were there and should have informed the car owner. The AITA's parents might have made a mistake by not passing the information. But the AITA is now seeking reimbursement, which is their right. So the answer is probably B, the AITA is not in the wrong because the person who caused the damage should reimburse them. The parents might have settled it without permission, but that doesn't absolve the other party's responsibility.\n"
