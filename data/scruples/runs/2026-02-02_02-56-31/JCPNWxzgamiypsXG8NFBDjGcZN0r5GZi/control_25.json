Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1000 damage. The parents didn't inform the author and let the kid off without reimbursement. The author is upset because they weren't told and now have to pay for repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are whether the author acted inappropriately by asking for reimbursement. The kid was 16, so a minor, and caused the damage. Generally, when someone causes damage, they are responsible for compensation. The parents might have tried to handle it, but the author wasn't informed. The author is now seeking reimbursement, which is their right.\n\nThe parents and others think the author is overreacting, but the author is just trying to cover their costs. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author isn't the one at fault here; the responsibility lies with the kid's family. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
