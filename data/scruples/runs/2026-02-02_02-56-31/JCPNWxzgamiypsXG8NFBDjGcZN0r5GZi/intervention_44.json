Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away. The kid and his parents went to their parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents waved it off. Now the user is upset because they weren't informed and have to pay for the damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for covering the costs. Even if the parents told the kid not to worry about it, the actual responsibility might still lie with the person who caused the damage. However, if the parents agreed to let it go, maybe there's a social expectation here to not pursue it further.\n\nBut then, the user wasn't informed. Since the car belongs to the user, they have a right to know about the damage. Their parents might have made a decision without consulting them, which could be part of the problem. The user's reaction is about being out $1,000, which is valid. They might feel wronged because their finances are affected.\n\nThe neighbors might think the user is overreacting, but that's their perspective. The user's right to compensation isn't necessarily invalid just because others think it's a minor issue. Legally, the kid's family should cover the damage, unless the parents explicitly took responsibility and the user is in a place where such informal settlements are accepted.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The key points are the right to know about the damage and the responsibility of the party who caused it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
