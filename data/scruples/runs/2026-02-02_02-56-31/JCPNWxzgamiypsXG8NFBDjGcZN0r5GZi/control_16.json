Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and spoke to the kid's parents, who offered an apology and maybe some payment, but the parents of the car owner waved it off. Now the car owner is upset because they had to pay $1,000 in repairs and feels everyone is taking the kid's side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, when someone damages another's property, they're responsible for the damages. The neighbor's kid caused the damage, so legally, the parents might be responsible since the kid is a minor. However, if the car owner's parents were present and accepted an apology and maybe even said not to worry about it, that could be seen as a settlement. But the car owner wasn't present, so their parents might not have the authority to settle the claim on their behalf. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The car owner is out $1,000 and didn't have a chance to decide whether to accept the apology or ask for compensation. The parents might have overstepped by dismissing the issue without consulting their adult child. On the other hand, the neighbor's parents did offer to pay, and the car owner's parents accepted their apology, which could complicate things.\n\nReddit often has mixed opinions, but generally, people expect accountability. The kid's parents might have acted quickly by offering to pay, but if the car owner's parents didn't accept the payment, the car owner has a right to seek reimbursement. However, if the parents of the car owner already resolved the matter, it's possible the car owner is in a tougher spot. But since the car owner wasn't informed, maybe the parents didn't have the right to decide that for them.\n\nSo, the car owner isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The neighbor's kid did cause damage, and the parents' offer might not have been accepted. The car owner's parents might have made a mistake by not allowing their child to handle it. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
