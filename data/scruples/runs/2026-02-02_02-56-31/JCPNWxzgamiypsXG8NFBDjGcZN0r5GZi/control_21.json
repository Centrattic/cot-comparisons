Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, apologized, and maybe offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. The author returns and finds out about the damage without being informed and is upset because there's no reimbursement. Everyone around the author says they're the asshole for asking for compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're legally responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the kid is a minor doesn't absolve his parents of liability because they're usually responsible for their child's actions. However, the parents might argue that they were already advised by the author's parents to not worry about it, which complicates things.\n\nThen there's the social angle. The author's parents might have resolved the issue themselves, thinking it's better to let it go, especially if the other parents were apologetic. The author wasn't present, so they rely on their parents' judgment. But the author is now out $1,000, which is a significant amount. The question is whether the author has a right to seek reimbursement even after their parents dismissed the issue.\n\nAnother point is communication. The author wasn't informed about the incident until returning. That could be a point of contention because the author had a right to know about the damage to their property. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but not informing the car owner could be an issue.\n\nLooking at similar situations, if someone's property is damaged, they have a right to seek compensation regardless of who they are. The fact that the author's parents initially said not to worry about it doesn't negate the author's right to be reimbursed for their own property's damage. However, the author's parents might have already negotiated or accepted the apology, which could create a conflict between the author and their parents.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if the owner of the car wasn't present, the person who caused the damage should contact the owner directly. The neighbor's parents might have approached the wrong people (the author's parents) instead of the actual owner. That could be a mistake on their part, but the author's parents might have authority over the car if it's their car, but the question states that the car was the author's, parked at their parents' house. So ownership is with the author.\n\nSo, legally, the neighbor's family should compensate the author for the damages. Socially, the author's parents might have tried to downplay it to avoid conflict, but the author is now facing the financial burden. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement because it's their property and they weren't informed. The parents might have mishandled the situation by not passing on the information or ensuring compensation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
