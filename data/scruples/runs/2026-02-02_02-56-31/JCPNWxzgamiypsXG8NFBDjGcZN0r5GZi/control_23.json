Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted about their neighbor's kid damaging their car is in the wrong. The situation is that the kid hit their car, and the parents and others told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they have to pay for the repairs and no one is helping. They\u2019re asking if they\u2019re the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the kid caused the damage, the parents were involved and told the author's parents not to make a big deal, and the author is now trying to get compensation. The neighbors might be in the wrong for not informing the owner and not compensating for the damage. \n\nFirst, legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. So the kid's parents should be liable. The fact that they tried to resolve it with the author's parents but were told not to worry about it complicates things. However, the author's parents might have given up their right to claim compensation by not pressing the issue. But the author wasn't part of the conversation, so they weren't even informed. \n\nIs the author wrong for seeking reimbursement now? Well, the problem is that the initial parties (the parents) already handled it, but the author wasn't involved. If the author didn't know about the damage until returning, they have a right to be upset. On the other hand, if the parents already resolved it, maybe the author's parents accepted the apology and the offer to pay but let it go. But the author's parents might have done that without consulting the author, leading to the author being stuck with the cost. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the kid's parents should have informed the actual owner (the author) since the car belongs to them. The author's parents might have overstepped by making a decision without the owner's input. The author is within their rights to want compensation because the damage was done to their property without their knowledge. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they weren't part of the initial resolution and are now dealing with the financial burden. The real issue is the lack of communication and the failure to involve the rightful owner. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
