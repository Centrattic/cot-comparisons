Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after a neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away. The kid hit the car, and even though he offered to pay, the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the user is upset because they didn't get reimbursement and others think they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone's property is damaged, they usually have the right to seek compensation. The user's parents might have forgiven the debt, but the user is the owner of the car, so maybe they can still pursue it. Then there's the social aspect. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The user feels wronged because they're out $1000. \n\nOn Reddit's AMTAR, often community opinions lean towards if someone is unreasonably expecting payment when it's been forgiven, but here the user wasn't even informed. The parents might have handled it, but maybe they should have contacted the user first. The kid's parents might be responsible here. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong because they're the car owner and can claim damages. The kid's family might be at fault for not informing the owner and not compensating. The user's parents might have overstepped by forgiving the debt without consulting the owner. So answer B.\n"
