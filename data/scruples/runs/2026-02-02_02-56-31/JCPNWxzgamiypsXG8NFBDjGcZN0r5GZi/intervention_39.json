Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person in the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that a neighbor's kid, 16 years old, backed into their parked car while they were away. The parents were home and the kid offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. The person came back to find the damage and is upset because they weren't informed and there's no reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. When someone's property is damaged, the owner has the right to seek compensation. Even though the parents were there, the car's owner was away. The parents might have thought they could handle it, but the actual owner (the person in the story) has the right to know about the damage and to seek reimbursement. The kid was at fault, so it's their responsibility to cover the costs unless there's a valid reason not to.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The kid's parents were there and knew what happened. They were upset about filing a claim, but the person whose car was damaged has a right to be informed. Not telling them about the incident is problematic because they weren't part of the conversation. The parents might have tried to settle it themselves, but that doesn't absolve the kid of responsibility. The fact that the kid offered to pay shows they admitted fault, so why wouldn't the parents pass that along?\n\nAlso, the person is being blamed for \"overreacting\" by people around them. But dealing with unexpected $1,000 damage is a legitimate issue. It's understandable to want compensation. The fact that others think the person is the \"asshole\" just because they're asking for what's owed is not fair. They're not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement when the other party is at fault.\n\nAnother angle: the parents might have thought they were protecting the kid by not involving the car owner. But that doesn't take away the fact that the damage occurred. The parents' decision to not inform the car owner is the problem here. The person isn't at fault for being unaware and now having to deal with the consequences.\n\nLegal liability typically follows the person who caused the damage. Since the kid hit the car, they are responsible. The parents might have tried to handle it, but if they didn't inform the owner, that's their issue. The person returning to find this damage has every right to ask for compensation. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents said not to worry about it doesn't negate the obligation to reimburse.\n\nSo putting it all together: the person isn't in the wrong. The neighbor kid and their parents failed to inform the car owner and didn't follow through on the kid's offer to pay. The person is justified in wanting reimbursement. The answer should be B.\n"
