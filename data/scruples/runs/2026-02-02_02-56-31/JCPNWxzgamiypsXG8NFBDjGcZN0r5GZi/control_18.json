Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and told not to worry about it, but the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, the kid is 16, which is a minor, so liability might fall on the parents. The parents were involved when the incident happened and were advised not to worry by the author's parents. The problem here is that the author's parents didn't inform them, leading to the author being unaware until returning. The author is now seeking reimbursement, but everyone else thinks they're overreacting.\n\nThe key points are: the owner wasn't informed, the kid is a minor, the parents were involved but didn't handle it, and the author is seeking compensation. Legally, the parents might be responsible as the kid's guardians. However, the author's parents initially said not to worry, which complicates things. The author's main issue is the lack of communication and not being compensated. Since the damage was done to their property without their knowledge, they have a right to be upset. The others are dismissing their claim, but the author isn't at fault for seeking what's owed. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the neighbor's family and their parents should handle the responsibility.\n"
