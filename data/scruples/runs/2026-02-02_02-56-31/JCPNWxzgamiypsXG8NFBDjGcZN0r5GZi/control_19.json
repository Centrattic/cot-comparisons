Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents didn't inform them and told the kid not to worry about it. Now the author is upset about not getting reimbursement and being called the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The car was parked at the parents' house, so maybe the parents had some responsibility to inform them. But the main issue here is the kid causing damage and not covering it. The author didn't know about the incident until returning, so they couldn't have addressed it themselves initially. \n\nThe parents and the neighbor might feel the author is overreacting because they didn't press charges and were told to let it go. However, the author is now facing unexpected expenses. Legally, if the kid is at fault, the parents (as guardians) might be responsible for the damages. The author has a right to seek reimbursement since they weren't informed and the damage isn't their fault. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect here. In some places, people might be more lenient about minor incidents, especially if an apology was given. However, $1,000 is a significant amount. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation, but perhaps they should have handled it through proper channels like insurance or legal steps, which they might not be aware of since the parents dismissed it. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have the right to ask for reimbursement? Yes, if the kid is at fault. Did they do something wrong by asking? Probably not. The neighbors and parents handled it without involving the owner, which might have been a mistake. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
