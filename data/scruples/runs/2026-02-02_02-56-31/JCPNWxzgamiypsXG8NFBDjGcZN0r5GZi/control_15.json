Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents of the kid were there, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursement and are being told they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The car was parked at the author's parents' house, so maybe they had some responsibility to inform them. However, the author wasn't present and didn't know about the damage until returning. The key points are: the kid caused damage, the parents were there, and the author's parents dismissed the issue. \n\nLegally, the kid's parents might be responsible since their child caused the damage. But since the author's parents already told the other parents to forget about it, there's a social aspect here. The author is now upset about being out $1000. The neighbors didn't inform the owner, which is a problem. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement because they were the owner. The parents might have handled it in a way that left the author out of the loop. The neighbors not notifying the author is a mistake. The author is justified in feeling wronged because they didn't get the compensation they should have. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to make sure. The parents' actions might have been well-meaning but not in the author's best interest. The kid's parents should have informed the owner when they became aware of the damage. The author is right to seek reimbursement as the rightful owner.\n"
