Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents and apologized, offering to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and feels everyone else thinks they're the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. When someone's property is damaged, they have the right to seek compensation. The author's parents might have been trying to be kind by not pressing the issue, but the author is the rightful owner of the car. Legally, the person who caused the damage (the kid) is responsible, and the parents might be liable if their child was\u672a\u6210\u5e74. However, since the parents were informed and the kid offered to pay but were told it's okay, maybe there's a social norm aspect here.\n\nBut the author is the actual victim here. They had no control over the situation when they were away, and their parents' decision doesn't absolve the other party from responsibility. The author is now facing a $1000 expense they didn't expect. The key points are: the damage was done, the parents didn't inform the owner, and the author is being blamed for seeking reimbursement.\n\nEthically, the kid caused damage and should compensate. The author's parents might have resolved it themselves, but the author has the right to know and handle it. If the kid and his parents were offered the chance to pay but declined due to the parents' assurance, maybe the author should follow up. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting their property to be compensated. The fact that others think they're overreacting might be because of social pressure to not make a big deal, but the author's right to seek reimbursement stands. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
