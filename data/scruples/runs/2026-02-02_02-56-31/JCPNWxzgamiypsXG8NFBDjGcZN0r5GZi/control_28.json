Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 damage. The parents didn't inform the author and let the kid off without reimbursement. Now the author is upset and being told they're the asshole for asking for compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are: the kid was at fault for hitting the car, the parents were present and let it go, and the author is now seeking reimbursement after returning. \n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, typically, if someone causes damage, they are responsible for compensating the owner. The kid is a minor, so the parents might be responsible as legal guardians. The fact that the parents allowed the kid to apologize and not pay seems like a problem. The author didn't know about the incident until they returned, so they couldn't have handled it themselves. \n\nHowever, the parents might have acted as intermediaries. If the parents accepted the apology and let it go, maybe the author's right to seek compensation now is in question. But in many places, the car owner has the right to seek compensation regardless. The parents might not have the authority to waive that right on the owner's behalf. \n\nAlso, the author is being blamed for \"overreacting,\" but the damage is their property. They have a right to be upset if someone else's actions caused financial loss. The kid and parents should have informed the actual owner (the author) and arranged payment. The fact that no one told the author is a big issue. \n\nSo the author isn't at fault for seeking reimbursement. The parents and the kid are responsible for the damage, not informing the owner, and not compensating. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
