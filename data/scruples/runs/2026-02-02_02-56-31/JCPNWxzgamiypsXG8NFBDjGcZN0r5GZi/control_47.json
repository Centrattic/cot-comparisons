Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is that the neighbor's kid, who's 16, hit the author's parked car while the author was away in Germany. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house and apologized, offering to pay, but the parents just brushed it off, saying not to worry. Now, the author comes back to find out about the damage and is upset that no one told him and that there's no compensation. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages your property, they are responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The parents did offer to pay, but the author's parents refused. However, the author isn't the one who refused; he's the car owner. The parents might have thought it was a minor accident and didn't want to involve the kids, but the author is now out $1000. Legally, the author might have a right to reimbursement since the damage was done without his consent.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents told the kid's family not to worry about it, which might be why the neighbor family thinks they're off the hook. But the author wasn't there to make that decision. The parents might have thought they were being kind, but by not informing the author, they didn't let him decide how to handle the situation. The author is within his rights to be upset because he's the one who has to pay for the repairs now. \n\nAlso, the fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay suggests that they acknowledge responsibility. If the author's parents accepted the apology and the offer, then maybe there's a social contract that the matter is settled. But since the author's parents didn't accept the payment, the author has a right to pursue it. \n\nHowever, maybe the author is overreacting because the parents handled it, and the author wasn't there. But the parents didn't have the authority to waive the author's rights. The author is the car owner, so he should be the one to decide whether to accept or reject compensation. The neighbor's family might not realize that the offer to pay was made to the author's parents, not the owner himself. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid's parents should have ensured that the author was informed and that the compensation was addressed. The author's parents might have made a mistake by not passing the information along. The author is justified in wanting to know about the damage and seeking reimbursement because he's the one who owns the car. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the people who caused the damage should be responsible for the cost, and the author's parents might have overstepped by not involving him. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
