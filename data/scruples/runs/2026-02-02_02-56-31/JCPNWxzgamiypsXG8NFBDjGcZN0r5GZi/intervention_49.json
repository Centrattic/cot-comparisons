Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away, and no one told them. The kid and his parents went to their parents' house, apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. Now the user is upset because they have to pay for repairs and others think they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone's property is damaged, usually the person responsible is liable. The kid was 16, so a minor, but his parents might be responsible since they were involved. The fact that the parents were upset about filing a claim might be a red flag. In some places, parents can be held responsible for their minor's actions.\n\nThen, the user's parents chose not to pursue compensation, which complicates things. If they're the legal owners of the car, maybe they have the right to forgive the debt. But the user is the one who owns the car, right? Wait, the user left the car at their parents' house. So the parents are the legal owners, or maybe the user is? That's unclear. If the user is the owner, then their parents might not have the authority to forgive the damages if the user is the one who has to pay for repairs. \n\nAlso, the user wasn't informed about the accident until returning. That's a problem because they had no opportunity to handle it themselves. The neighbor's family didn't inform them, which might be part of the issue. If the parent's house is where the car was parked, maybe the parents are responsible for notifying the user, especially if they were acting as the caretakers of the car.\n\nAnother angle: the kid offered to pay, but the parents refused. If the parents accepted the apology and said not to worry, maybe they felt it was resolved. But the user is now out of pocket because the parents didn't handle it properly. The user's frustration is valid because they're the one facing the financial burden.\n\nSo, legally, the responsible party (the kid's parents) should cover the damages. The user's parents might have made a decision that affected the user's rights. If the user is the car's owner, the parents might not have the authority to waive compensation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, letting the user handle it themselves after the fact might be seen as unfair. The user isn't the asshole for wanting compensation; they're being reasonable. The parents and neighbors might be in the wrong for not informing them and not taking responsibility. \n\nSo putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They have a right to seek reimbursement for damages caused to their property. The answer is B.\n"
