Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person's car was damaged by a neighbor's 16-year-old kid while they were in Germany. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house, apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. Now, the person is upset because they weren't informed and have to pay for repairs. The question is whether they're in the wrong for seeking reimbursement.\n\nFirst, legally, if someone causes damage, they're usually responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so the parents might be liable. The parents might have an insurance claim or some responsibility here. However, the parents already told the kid not to worry about it, so maybe they intended to handle it themselves. But the original owner wasn't informed, which is a problem because they're the ones who have to pay for repairs.\n\nEthically, the person isn't at fault for wanting compensation. They weren't there to handle it, and their parents might have made a decision without considering their perspective. The neighbors might have insurance that can cover it, but the parents might be avoiding conflict. The person is upset because they're out of pocket and didn't know about the incident. The neighbors might think it's resolved, but maybe they didn't actually pay for it. \n\nSo, the person isn't the asshole here. They're seeking what they're owed. The neighbors and parents might be in the wrong for not informing them and not handling the compensation properly. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
