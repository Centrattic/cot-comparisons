Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after a neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away. The kid hit the car, and the parents went to their parents' house. The parents told them not to worry, but now the user is upset because they have to pay for the repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for covering the costs. Even if the owner isn't present, the person who caused the damage should take responsibility. The fact that the kid is a minor might mean the parents are legally liable. So, the user has a right to seek reimbursement.\n\nThen, the social dynamics. The parents told the neighbor not to worry, so maybe they thought it was resolved. But the user wasn't consulted, and they're the one facing the financial hit. The parents might have wanted to avoid conflict, but that doesn't mean the user's reaction is wrong. They're entitled to their feelings about losing money.\n\nThe user's argument is that the kid caused the damage and should reimburse them. The neighbors didn't inform them, and the parents dismissed it. The user isn't overreacting; they\u2019re dealing with unexpected costs. The neighbors might be in the wrong for not covering the expenses, even if they apologized.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They have a valid claim for compensation. The answer should be B.\n"
