Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong after a neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away. The key points here are that the kid hit the car, the parents were involved, and the user's parents didn't inform them about the incident. The user is now upset about not being told and not getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the kid caused damage, the parent's responsibility might come into play since the kid is a minor. In many places, parents can be held liable for their minor children's actions. So legally, the parents might owe compensation. But the user's parents didn't inform them, which complicates things.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The user's parents handled the situation without consulting the car owner. They might have thought it was a good idea to avoid conflict, but the car owner (the user) has every right to know about the damage and seek reimbursement. The kid did offer to pay, but the parents might have dismissed it. The user is now facing the financial burden, which isn't fair.\n\nAlso, the community's take is that the user is the asshole, but that might be because they didn't know the full story. The user's main issue is the lack of communication and not being informed. They're not overreacting to a small issue; it's a significant amount of money. \n\nIn summary, the user isn't at fault. The kid's parents and the user's parents both have responsibilities here. The user isn't the one who caused the damage, and they have a right to seek reimbursement. The answer should be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
