Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong after their neighbor's kid damaged their car and they want reimbursement. \n\nFirst, the situation: The car was parked at the parent's house while the author was abroad. The neighbor's 16-year-old backed into it. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and the parents said not to worry. The author comes back to find $1k damage, no one told him, and now he's upset about not getting reimbursement. The parents and others think he's overreacting.\n\nSo, the main points here. The kid caused the damage. The parents of the kid were present and maybe took responsibility? The author's own parents dismissed the situation, even though they were the ones informed. Now the author is being blamed for wanting compensation.\n\nLegally, if a minor causes damage, the parents are typically liable. The fact that the kid's parents were there and maybe agreed to pay but didn't follow through? Or maybe they just said they'd handle it but didn't. The author's parents might have been too lenient, but that doesn't make the author wrong in seeking reimbursement for their own property.\n\nEmotionally, the author is upset because they had to pay for something they didn't do, and it's their own car. The neighbors didn't inform them, which adds to the frustration. The parents not standing up for their own son's liability? Not sure. But the author isn't responsible for the kid's actions. They are justified in wanting to get their money back, especially since the damage was done when they weren't present.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The kid is at fault, the parents should handle it, and the author is just trying to recover costs. The answer is B.\n"
