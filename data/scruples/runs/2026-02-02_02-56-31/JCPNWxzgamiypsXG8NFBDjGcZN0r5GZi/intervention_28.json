Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong when their neighbor's kid hit their car while they were abroad. The kid was 16, and their parents and the user's parents all decided to just let it go. The user is upset because they weren't informed until they came back and now have to pay for repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages your car, they're responsible for the damages. Even if you're not there, the owner has a right to compensation. So maybe the kid is at fault. But since the kid is a minor, the responsibility falls on his parents. The parents might be liable here.\n\nThen there's the situation with the user's parents. They told the neighbor's parents not to worry about it. But the user didn't know and now is out $1,000. The user's parents made a decision without consulting their child. Is that their responsibility? Well, if the user's parents said not to worry, maybe they assumed the matter was resolved. But the user is the car owner, so they should have the right to decide about reimbursement.\n\nThe user is angry because they were excluded from the decision. The neighbor's family didn't inform them, and now they're being told to accept no compensation. But it's not their fault that their parents didn't push for reimbursement. The user is the actual victim here, right? They owned the car and were damaged without their knowledge. The neighbor's family might have resolved the issue with the user's parents, but the user is the one who ends up paying.\n\nHowever, maybe the user's parents had a good reason to let it go. If the kid offered to pay and they said no, that's their decision. But the user didn't agree to that. So the user's parents might have overstepped by making that decision for their child. The user has the right to seek compensation, even if their parents didn't want to pursue it.\n\nSo, legally, the neighbor's kid (and parents) are responsible. The user is not in the wrong for wanting reimbursement. The user's parents might have made a mistake by not informing them and by not ensuring compensation. The user is justified in being upset because they're the one who has to pay for the damages. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
