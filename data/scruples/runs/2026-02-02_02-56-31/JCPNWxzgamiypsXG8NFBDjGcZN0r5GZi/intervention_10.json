Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong here. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents let it slide. Now the user is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and everyone's telling them to just accept it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and social aspects. Legally, if someone's property is damaged, the owner has the right to seek compensation. Even if the parents accepted the apology and let it go, the actual owner (the user) might still be entitled to reimbursement. The user wasn't present, so maybe they weren't aware of the option to file an insurance claim or get compensation. \n\nBut socially, the neighbors might feel that the parents already handled it, and the user is overreacting now. The kid is a minor, so responsibility might fall on the parents. But the user's parents might not want to involve the kid's parents again or risk a conflict. \n\nThe user's parents might have thought it was a minor issue or wanted to avoid any tension. However, the user is the one who has to pay for the repairs. If the parents didn't inform the user about the option to pursue reimbursement, maybe they made a mistake. The user isn't the one who caused the damage, so they aren't at fault. The neighbors, especially the kid's family, should cover the cost. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the user isn't in the wrong) because they're the victim here. The issue is the parents not standing up for their child's property and the neighbors not informing the owner or compensating them.\n"
