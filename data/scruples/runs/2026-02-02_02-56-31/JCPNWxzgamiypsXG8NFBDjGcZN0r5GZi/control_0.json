Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and met the kid and his mom, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author comes back to find out about the damage and is upset because no one told them and there's no compensation. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal implications. In many places, if someone damages your property without your knowledge, they're responsible for the damages. The kid is 16, so his parents might be legally liable as they're the ones responsible for his actions. The parents might have a duty to cover the costs. However, the parents here told the kid not to worry about it, so maybe they're avoiding responsibility. \n\nBut the author's parents were present and initially said not to worry. The author didn't know, so they're asking for reimbursement now. The neighbors might argue that the author's parents had already forgiven the debt, but the author wasn't part of that conversation. The author is now being blamed for \"overreacting\" but they're the one who owns the car. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author might have a right to seek compensation. However, the parents' initial response could complicate things. If the parents had already accepted the apology and dismissed the claim, maybe the author is now complicating things. But the author hasn't been informed, which is a problem. The parents might have overstepped by not consulting the car owner. \n\nMorally, the kid caused damage, so he should pay. The parents might be in the wrong for not allowing their kid to take responsibility. The author is justified in wanting reimbursement, especially since they weren't part of the initial resolution. The neighbors and others are saying the author is the asshole because they didn't know, but that doesn't negate the damage. \n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B. They have a valid claim for the damages caused by the kid, and the parents' decision to not inform them or allow compensation is where the fault lies. The author isn't at fault for seeking what they're owed.\n"
