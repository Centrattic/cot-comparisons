Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong when a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were abroad, and they want reimbursement. The kid's family was informed but told not to worry about it by the user's parents. Now the user is upset because they have to pay for the damages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the parents were involved and maybe even the kid offered to pay suggests that there was an opportunity to address the issue then. However, the user's parents dismissed it, which might have led to the current problem.\n\nEmotionally, the user is frustrated because they weren't informed and are now out $1,000. The parents might feel that since they handled it, the user shouldn't bring it up now. But the user is the one who owns the car and has the out-of-pocket expense. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the kid was at fault, it's reasonable for the user to seek compensation. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay initially might mean there's a willingness to rectify the situation. The parents' decision to not pursue it might have been based on avoiding conflict or other reasons, but that doesn't absolve the kid of responsibility.\n\nOn Reddit, the usual responses might be mixed. Some might say the user is in the right for seeking what's owed, while others might think the user should be more understanding given the past resolution. But legally and practically, the user is trying to get reimbursed for damages caused by someone else's negligence. The fact that they're now being told they're the asshole by their parents and others could be because people downplay the situation, but that doesn't change the user's justified frustration.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
