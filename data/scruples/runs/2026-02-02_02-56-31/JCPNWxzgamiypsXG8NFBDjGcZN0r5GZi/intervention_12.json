Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after their neighbor's 16-year-old kid damaged their car while they were away. The kid hit the car, and the parents were involved but were told not to worry by the user's parents. Now the user is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and everyone is telling them they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: when someone's property is damaged by another, the responsible party (here, the kid and his family) is typically liable to cover the costs. The user's parents might have forgiven the debt, but the user is the car owner, so maybe they have a right to seek compensation. However, in some jurisdictions, if the owner (user's parents) waived the claim, the user might not have standing. But if the user is the registered owner, that's different.\n\nThen there's the social angle. The user's parents told the neighbors not to worry, but the user feels wronged because they didn't know about the damage until returning. The neighbors might feel that since the user wasn't present, they shouldn't be held to the same standard now. But the user is the one who has to pay for the repairs.\n\nMoral responsibility: The kid made a mistake, apologized, and offered to pay initially. The parents might have settled it locally, but the user's parents dismissed it. Now the user is facing the financial burden. The user might feel it's unfair to absorb the cost when they weren't involved in the initial decision.\n\nPossible angles where the user could be at fault: If the user's parents had the authority to waive the claim, then the user might not have a leg to stand on. Also, if there's a cultural norm where such incidents are handled informally and the user is overreacting by seeking compensation now.\n\nOn the other hand, the user isn't the one who dismissed the claim; they were unaware. They have a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation if they believe it's their right. The neighbors might have assumed the matter was settled because the user's parents said so, but the user isn't bound by that if they're the actual owner.\n\nLegally, if the user is the registered owner, the liability falls on the kid's family. The user's parents might not have the right to forgive the debt on their behalf. So the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the user's parents had the authority to do so (like if they own the car), then maybe. But the user's scenario states it's their car parked at their parents' house, so likely they're the owner.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong. They have a right to seek reimbursement for damages caused to their property. The neighbors and their parents might have thought the matter was resolved, but the user wasn't part of that agreement. The user's reaction is reasonable given the unexpected financial loss. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
