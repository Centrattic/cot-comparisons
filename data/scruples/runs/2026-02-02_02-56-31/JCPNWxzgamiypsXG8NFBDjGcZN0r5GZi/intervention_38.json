Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user left their car parked at their parents' house in the US while they were in Germany for three months. A neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the car, causing $1k in damage. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house to address it, and the parents told them not to worry about it. The kid offered to pay but was told not to. Now the user is upset because they didn't know and there's no compensation. They're being told they're the asshole for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, the user's parents handled the situation, but maybe they didn't have the authority to forgive the debt. The kid is a minor, so responsibility might fall on the parents. The user is the car owner, so they should be informed. The parents might have thought it was a minor issue, but the user is the one who has to pay for repairs. The kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The user is upset because they're out $1k and being told to accept it. \n\nLegally, if the parents accepted the kid's apology and said not to worry, maybe there's no liability. But ethically, the kid caused damage and the parents might be at fault for not ensuring compensation. The user's parents might have made a decision without considering the owner's needs. The user isn't the one who hit the car, so they're not at fault. The kid and his parents are responsible for the damage. The user is justified in seeking reimbursement since they're the car owner. So the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
