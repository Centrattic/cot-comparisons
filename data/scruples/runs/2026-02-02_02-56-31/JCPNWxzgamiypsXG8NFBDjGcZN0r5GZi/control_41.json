Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom, but didn't inform the owner. Now the author is upset about the $1k damage and wants reimbursement. Everyone says he's the asshole for asking for it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here: the author wasn't present; their parents were the ones who interacted with the neighbor. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author is now asking for the $1k, but the parents and others think he's overreacting.\n\nLegally, if someone causes damage to your property, they're responsible for reimbursing you unless you waive that right. If the parents accepted the apology and said not to worry about it, maybe that could be seen as the owner (the author) waiving the claim. But wait, the author wasn't there; they were in Germany. So maybe the parents didn't have the authority to waive the author's right to compensation. The parents are the legal guardians, but the car belongs to the author. So if the parents said not to worry about it without consulting the author, that might not be valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor kid did take responsibility and offered to pay. If the parents accepted that and said it's okay, maybe the author is now being unreasonable to ask for payment again. But if the parents didn't have the right to waive the author's claim, then the author is justified in seeking reimbursement even if the parents said to forget it.\n\nAlso, the author wasn't informed. The parents didn't tell them about the accident. So the author missed out on the chance to handle it directly. The parents might have made a decision without the owner's consent. In that case, the author isn't at fault for wanting the compensation now that he knows.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the kid's family caused the damage and should pay. The parents might have made a mistake by not informing the author. The author's anger is about not being informed and not being compensated. The neighbors might be in the wrong for not informing the actual owner and not compensating them properly. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement after being kept in the dark. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
