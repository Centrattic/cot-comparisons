Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user left their car parked at their parents' house while in Germany for three months. A 16-year-old neighbor hit the car and damaged it. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house, apologized, and the parents said not to worry. Now the user is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, the kid is at fault for causing the damage. Since he's a minor, his parents would be responsible. The user's parents might have forgiven the debt, but the user is the car owner and should have been informed. The parents didn't consult the user, which is a problem. The user is asking for reimbursement, which is reasonable as the car owner. Others think the user is overreacting, but they have a right to expect compensation for their property. The neighbors didn't inform the user either. So, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
