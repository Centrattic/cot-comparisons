Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user's situation is that their neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and the parents went to their parents' house and apparently the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the user is coming back and is upset that they didn't get any reimbursement. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal responsibilities here. If someone's property is damaged, the person responsible is usually liable for the damages. The kid is a minor (16), so his parents would typically be responsible. But since the parents were present and told the user's parents not to worry about it, maybe there was a settlement or agreement made on the spot.\n\nBut the user wasn't there. Their parents might have decided not to press the matter. However, the user is the owner of the car, so they have the right to seek compensation. The problem is whether the parents had the authority to waive that right. If the parents forgave the debt, then maybe the user can't go back and ask for money now. But if there was no legal agreement or if the parents didn't have the authority (since they're not the car's owner), then the user might still have a claim.\n\nAnother angle: the kid's parents might have a duty to cover the costs, even if the user's parents didn't ask for payment. But maybe in some jurisdictions, if the parties involved (the parents of both sides) resolved the issue, that's considered a valid agreement. However, the user is the one who owns the car and incurs the repair costs. The user's parents might have been acting against their interests by not insisting on payment.\n\nBut the user's parents might have thought it's better to let it go for the sake of peace. However, the user is now burdened with the cost. It's a bit of a conflict between family dynamics and legal rights. \n\nLegally, if there was no formal agreement, the user could still pursue the claim. But if the parents accepted the apology and forgave the debt, then maybe not. However, the user wasn't involved in that decision. So maybe the user's parents were in the wrong for not handling it properly.\n\nIn terms of morality, the kid did hit the car and should pay. The parents might have acted to avoid conflict, but it left the owner (user) without compensation. The user isn't the asshole for wanting their money back, especially since they weren't part of the initial resolution. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). They are justified in seeking reimbursement since their car was damaged and the responsibility lies with the at-fault party. The parents might have messed up by not involving the user in the decision.\n"
