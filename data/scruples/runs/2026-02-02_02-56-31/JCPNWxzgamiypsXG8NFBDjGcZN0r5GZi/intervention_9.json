Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong when the neighbor kid hit their parked car. They left the car at their parent's house while they were in Germany for three months. The kid, who's 16, backed into it, and when his parents found out, they were upset about contacting the police or filing a claim. The parents said not to worry, and the kid offered to pay but they declined. Now the user is home and upset because they found out about the damage and nobody told them, and they're being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nHmm. So, legally, the kid was at fault. In many places, if someone damages another's property, they're liable for the damages. The kid is a minor, so the parents would be responsible. The parents, though, seem to have resolved it by saying it's okay, but the user wasn't informed. The user is now out $1000 because of the damage. \n\nThe user's parents might have handled it in a way that they thought was best, maybe trying to avoid conflict or legal issues. But the user is the rightful owner of the car, and they have the right to seek compensation for the damages. The parents might have acted without consulting the user, especially since the user was away. So, the user's frustration is about not being informed and not being able to get reimbursement. \n\nEveryone around them is saying they're the asshole, but the user is just trying to cover their expenses. The kid did cause the damage, so the user isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The parents' decision to let it go might have been well-intentioned, but it doesn't absolve the kid of responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the user is not in the wrong. They're justified in wanting to be compensated for the damages caused by someone else's negligence. The fact that they were kept in the dark and then expected to just accept no reimbursement is unfair. Therefore, the correct choice is B.\n"
