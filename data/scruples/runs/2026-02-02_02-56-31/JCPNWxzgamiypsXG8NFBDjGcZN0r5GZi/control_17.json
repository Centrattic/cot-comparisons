Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user was in Germany for three months and left their car parked at their parents' house. A 16-year-old neighbor hit the car while backing up. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house to resolve it. The parents said not to worry, the kid apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry. Now the user is back and found $1k damage. They're upset because they weren't told and there's no compensation. Everyone says they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the kid hit the car. The kid is a minor, so his parents are responsible. The kid and parents went to the user's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the user's parents declined. The user didn't know about the incident until returning. Now the user is seeking reimbursement, but others think they're overreacting.\n\nLegally, when someone's property is damaged, they can seek compensation. The fact that the parents were present might complicate things. If the parents told the other party not to worry about it, does that mean the issue is resolved? But the parents aren't the owners of the car; the user is. The user's parents may have no authority to forgive the debt on behalf of the user. So maybe the user is justified in seeking compensation because they were never informed and the damage is their responsibility to fix.\n\nHowever, the parents might have thought it was a minor incident and let it go. But the user is the one who has to pay for the repairs. There's a conflict here. The user isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement because they weren't part of the initial conversation. The parents might have made a decision without consulting the user, which is a problem if they have no right to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, the kid's family might have tried to handle it by apologizing and offering payment, but the user's parents accepted the apology and said not to worry. The user is now upset that they have to pay. The question is whether the user's parents could have the authority to forgive the damage. Since the car belongs to the user, they should have been involved. So the parents might have overstepped, and the user is right to seek compensation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong because they were not informed and the people who handled the situation weren't the rightful owners. The responsibility for the damage lies with the person who caused it, which is the kid, but since he's a minor, his parents are liable. Therefore, the user is justified in asking for reimbursement. The answer should be B (No).\n"
