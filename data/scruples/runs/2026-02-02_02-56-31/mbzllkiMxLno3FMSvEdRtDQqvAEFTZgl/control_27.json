It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a friend (Annie) who's married to Frank, and the author (AITA) supported Frank after he found out Annie cheated. The main issue is the author suggesting a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out the baby wasn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author has known Annie since childhood, acting as a sister figure. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-on, 14-off schedule. Over three years, the author felt something was off but didn't have proof. When a pregnancy was announced, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank later used that idea, and the test confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, Frank is moving away, and the author is criticized by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are the author's role in suggesting the test. The user is asking if that was wrong. On one hand, the author noticed something wrong and tried to help Frank. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by not having concrete evidence. Emotional cheating is tricky; it's not the same as physical infidelity. The author's suggestion could have been based on suspicion without proof, leading to the breakup. However, the outcome was the truth coming out, which might have been inevitable if Frank had doubts.\n\nAlso, the author's friends and family blame them for the marriage's end. But if Annie was indeed cheating and the baby wasn't Frank's, maybe the marriage was already in trouble. The author's action might have been a catalyst, but Annie's actions were the root cause. The author didn't have malicious intent; they were trying to help a friend. However, the method of bringing up the paternity test, especially after drinking, might have been insensitive. Still, the author didn't know the full story and acted on their observations.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on intent and whether the actions were reasonable. The author didn't know for sure, but they had a suspicion. Suggesting a paternity test, even if it feels like a shot in the dark, could be seen as trying to help. However, without clear evidence, it's possible the author misread the situation. But given that the result was the truth, maybe it was necessary. The main issue is that the author's suggestion led to the revelation, but the real fault lies with Annie for cheating. The author might not be entirely wrong, but they might share some responsibility for not being more cautious.\n\nAnother angle: Emotional cheating doesn't always result in a child, but in this case, it did. The author's suggestion forced Frank to confront the issue, which he might have avoided otherwise. So, the author helped reveal a problem that needed to be addressed, even if it caused immediate pain. The question is whether the author had the right to intervene. Since they were close to both parties, it's possible they felt responsible. However, maybe they should have stayed out of it. But considering the outcome, perhaps they're not at fault because the marriage was already unstable due to Annie's actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author acted on suspicion, tried to help a friend, and the truth came out. While the method was questionable, the intent was good, and the real wrongdoing was Annie's. The author didn't know the baby wasn't Frank's; they only had a feeling. So, they're not entirely at fault.\n"
