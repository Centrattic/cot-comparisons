I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie cheated, and the person (let's call them the narrator) was a close friend to Annie. The narrator suspected the affair and suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery that the child isn't his. Now, the narrator is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The narrator had a close relationship with Annie since childhood, which might mean they care about both Frank and Annie. They noticed something off but couldn't do much due to the distance. Then, during a visit, they suggested a paternity test after some drinks. Frank took that suggestion seriously and did the test, leading to the breakdown of his marriage. The family is upset with the narrator for causing this.\n\nThe question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Did the narrator have a right to intervene? Well, they suspected something wrong but didn't have proof. Their suggestion might have been based on a hunch. However, even if they had concerns, bringing up the idea of a paternity test is a serious accusation. It's possible that the test was the only way Frank could confirm his suspicions, but the narrator might not have been in a position to make that suggestion. \n\nOn the other hand, Frank is the one who ended up taking the test based on his own judgment after the suggestion. The root cause of the problem is Annie's infidelity. The narrator's action was a catalyst, but the decision was ultimately Frank's. However, suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as meddling in someone else's marriage, even with good intentions. The narrator might have overstepped by pushing Frank to take such a drastic step without concrete proof.\n\nAlso, the narrator's family is criticizing them for ruining the marriage. The narrator is defending themselves by saying Annie created the situation, which is true. But their actions did lead to the exposure of the infidelity and the subsequent breakdown. Whether they are at fault depends on whether they had the right to intervene. In relationships, it's usually up to the individuals involved to address issues between themselves. The narrator's suggestion might have been premature or based on incomplete information.\n\nAnother angle: the narrator had a close relationship with Annie and might have felt protective, but that doesn't justify suggesting something as serious as a paternity test. They could have advised Frank to talk to Annie directly instead of jumping to conclusions. The fact that Frank did take the test and found out the truth means that the marriage had underlying issues. The narrator's role was to point out a suspicion, which led to the truth coming out. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the main wrongdoer is Annie for cheating. Frank is now aware and had to make a decision. The narrator's action was a contributing factor, but not the root cause. However, the act of suggesting a paternity test without evidence can be seen as crossing a boundary. Depending on the cultural or personal norms, this might be considered meddling. \n\nBut considering that the narrator had a suspicion and tried to help Frank secure his position as a father, maybe their intention was good. However, the method might have been flawed. The key point is that the narrator acted based on a feeling rather than facts. In such situations, it's often better to let the people involved handle it themselves unless there's clear evidence. \n\nIn conclusion, while the narrator's intentions might have been to help Frank, suggesting a paternity test without proof could be seen as overstepping. However, the main fault lies with Annie. The narrator is not entirely wrong, but they might share some responsibility for causing the situation to escalate. So, depending on the perspective, the answer could be nuanced. But according to the options given (A or B), the answer would require a choice. If the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong, considering they acted on a hunch and influenced Frank's decision, the answer might be A (Yes), but if the main fault is Annie's, then B (No). However, since their action directly led to the breakup, there's a case for A. But in many cases, people might say that the narrator isn't entirely wrong because they were acting on their concern. It's a tricky one.\n"
