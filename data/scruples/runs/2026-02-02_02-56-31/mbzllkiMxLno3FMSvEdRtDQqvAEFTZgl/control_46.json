It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's like a sister to Annie, knew that Frank was in the oil industry with a 14-day on and off schedule. Over three years, Annie never directly said she was cheating, but the author had a feeling. Then when they found out Annie was pregnant, the author suggested a paternity test to Frank after some drinks. That led to Frank finding out the kid wasn't his and that Annie was emotionally cheating. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to protect Frank, right? They thought maybe the kid wasn't his, so suggesting a paternity test was to confirm. But the problem is that the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. Even though Annie was cheating emotionally, the author's comment led to the paternity test. However, the real issue is that Frank was the one who cheated, or in this case, Annie was the one cheating. Wait, no, the husband Frank was the one who was cheated on. Annie was the cheater. So the author's action led to Frank discovering the infidelity. But the author is being criticized for causing the breakdown of the marriage.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author overstep by bringing up the paternity test? The author didn't know for sure, just had a feeling. But maybe Frank was already suspecting something, and the author's comment pushed him to act. However, it's also possible that Frank needed to confront the issue regardless. The author's role was as a friend, trying to look out for Frank. But maybe they shouldn't have made that suggestion without more evidence. However, given that the marriage was already in trouble due to Annie's actions, maybe the author was right to help Frank uncover the truth.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the child. The author argues it's unfair to bring up the child's well-being against them, since Annie was the one who created the situation. But others might say the author's intervention caused the child to be separated from Frank. However, if the child isn't Frank's, then maybe the separation is necessary. It's a bit of a mess.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intentions were to help a friend, but the method might have been questionable. However, the fault for the cheating lies with Annie, not the author. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank discover the truth, even if their approach was a bit hasty. The real blame should be on Annie for cheating. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
