  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the user is close to Annie and suspected she was cheating. The user suggested a paternity test, leading to the discovery that the child isn't Frank's. Now, the user is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial stability.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's actions. They noticed something off over three years and felt compelled to bring it up. The user's suggestion led Frank to get a paternity test, which confirmed his suspicions. The user didn't know for sure but acted on a feeling, which turned out to be correct. \n\nAnnie's actions\u2014emotional cheating and having a child with someone else\u2014definitely cross lines. The user's role was to voice a concern that ultimately exposed the truth. However, the user is being criticized by their family for interfering. \n\nThe question is about whether the user is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, the user tried to help Frank uncover the truth. Even if it caused upheaval, the result was that Frank wasn't the biological father. The user didn't know for sure but acted on a hunch, which led to the right outcome. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might have overstepped by making the suggestion, even if it was well-intentioned. But since Annie was the one who cheated, the primary responsibility lies with her. The user's family is blaming them for the consequences, which seems unfair. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They acted on a suspicion that turned out to be true, helping Frank realize the situation he was in. The blame should be on Annie for her actions, not the user for trying to help.\n"
