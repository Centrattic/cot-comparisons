It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) who suggested a paternity test is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister Annie, her husband Frank, and the fact that Annie was cheating. The baby isn't Frank's.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author noticed something was off but lived far away, so couldn't do much. Then, after some time, they made a comment about a paternity test when they were drunk. Frank took it seriously and got the test, which proved the baby wasn't his. Now, the author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. Did the author have a right to say something? They had a suspicion, but no proof. They were concerned for Frank. But they brought it up when they were drunk, which might not have been the best time. However, their comment led to the paternity test, which revealed the truth.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention might have been to protect Frank from being a parent to someone else's child. On the other hand, they didn't have proof, just a feeling. The fact that they were drunk could affect how their comment was perceived. But they didn't directly accuse anyone; they just suggested a test. Frank made the decision to do it himself. \n\nAnnie had been cheating emotionally, which might mean she had been misleading Frank for years. The author's role was more of a catalyst here. The family is blaming the author for the fallout, but maybe the real issue is Annie's infidelity and deception. The author might not be in the wrong because they tried to help Frank discover the truth, even if their method was a bit hasty. However, the author's comment could be seen as an invasion of privacy or overstepping, especially since they weren't in a position to know for sure.\n\nBut considering that the baby isn't Frank's, and Annie was cheating, the truth came out because of the author's suggestion. Without the author's comment, Frank might have remained unaware, which could be worse in the long run. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because they were trying to help Frank uncover the infidelity, even if it happened in a less than ideal way. However, the drunk comment might have been inappropriate, but the outcome was the truth being revealed, which is the right thing. So the author isn't wrong, but maybe they could have handled it better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. So probably B.\n"
