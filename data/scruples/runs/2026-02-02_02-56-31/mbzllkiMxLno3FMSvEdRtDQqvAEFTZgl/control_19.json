It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote this (let's call them the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend's sister, Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank, and the author supported Frank, leading to the breakup and now the author is being blamed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. The author knew Annie since childhood and considered her a sister. Frank was in a long-distance marriage because of his job. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. During a visit, the author casually suggested a paternity test while they were drunk. Frank took the suggestion seriously and got the test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, the author is being criticized for causing the marriage to end, leading to Frank's financial and social difficulties.\n\nThe author is defending their actions by saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. The family thinks the author should have stayed silent. The key points here are the author's intention and action. Did they overstep by suggesting the test? Was it their place to do so, even if they suspected infidelity?\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping Frank by pointing out the possibility. But they didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. Suggesting a paternity test based on suspicion could be seen as meddling. On the other hand, if Annie was emotionally cheating and having a child with another man, that's a betrayal. The author's support for Frank could be seen as justifiable once the truth came out.\n\nBut the problem is that the author's suggestion led directly to the test and the breakup. Even if Annie was at fault, the author's role in exposing the infidelity might have been unnecessary. The author might have crossed a boundary by intervening in a private matter without being directly involved. However, considering the emotional cheating and the child not being Frank's, maybe the author's concern was valid.\n\nAnother angle: the author's parents and siblings blame them for ruining the marriage. The author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation. The test revealed the truth, so maybe the author isn't to blame. However, the method of bringing it up (after drinking) and the context might have been inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered private to suspect infidelity, and intervening in someone else's relationship can be seen as overstepping. But if the author had a close relationship with both Frank and Annie, maybe they felt justified. Still, the consequences are severe for Frank, including financial loss and isolation. The author might be seen as partly responsible for the fallout, even if they were right about the infidelity.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author might have intended to help but caused harm. However, since Annie was indeed cheating, the author's action led to a necessary truth, but the approach was flawed. So, could be either way. But in terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank, but their method was questionable. Alternatively, they might be in the wrong because they meddled without being asked.\n"
