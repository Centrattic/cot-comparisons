  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user is a friend of Annie, who's been married to Frank. Frank was in the oil industry with a work schedule of two weeks on and two weeks off. The user suspected that Annie was cheating, but Annie never admitted it. Then when there was a baby on the way, the user suggested Frank do a paternity test, maybe after drinking. Frank ended up getting a test, which showed the kid wasn't his. Now Annie is in a tough spot financially and emotionally, and the user is getting criticized for their role in breaking up the marriage. The user feels that Annie was the one who created the situation, and they're standing by their suggestion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the user suspected infidelity but didn't have proof, suggested a paternity test which led to the discovery, and now is being blamed for the fallout. The question is whether the user is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, let's consider if the user had a right to say something. Since they were close to both Frank and Annie, they might have felt responsible. However, making such a suggestion, even if jokingly, could be seen as an invasion of privacy. But if they had genuine suspicions, maybe it's understandable. Frank was the one who decided to act on it by getting the test. But the user brought it up, which is why Frank considered it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user overstepped by bringing up a paternity test. It's a serious matter, and even if they were concerned, making a joke about it might not be the right approach. However, Frank later insisted on the test, so the user's comment might have been the catalyst. \n\nNow, the user's justification is that Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating, so they weren't in the wrong. But the user's action of suggesting a test could have been the trigger. Even if their intention was good, was it their place to bring it up? They might have crossed a boundary by doing so without concrete evidence. \n\nAlso, the user is being criticized for ruining the marriage, but the marriage was already problematic due to Annie's actions. However, the user's suggestion directly led to the breakup. So the user's role is a bit complex. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if you suspect something like this, perhaps the right approach is to talk to the person involved (Annie) first, or maybe not get involved at all. But the user didn't have direct evidence, just a feeling. So maybe the user had no right to make that suggestion. \n\nAlternatively, if the user was genuinely concerned for Frank and thought the suggestion was in his best interest, maybe it's understandable. But the way it was done\u2014after drinking and as a joke\u2014might not have been appropriate. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The user might be seen as overstepping by suggesting a paternity test based on suspicion without evidence, which led to the breakup. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong). But if the user's intention was good and they were just trying to help Frank, it's a gray area. However, the act of bringing up such a serious accusation without proof could be considered wrong, so probably A.\n"
