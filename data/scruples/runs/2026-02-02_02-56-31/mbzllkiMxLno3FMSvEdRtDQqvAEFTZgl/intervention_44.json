  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is a close friend to Annie, who's like a sister. Annie married Frank, who works in oil and has a 14-day on/off schedule. For three years, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the user suspected it. Then, when they found out Annie was pregnant, the user, after some alcohol, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. The user's comment came back to haunt them because Frank mentioned it, leading to the marriage breakdown. Now, the user is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage and is isolated, along with Frank.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they were wrong to make that comment. Let's consider the factors. The user's intention was based on a suspicion, not concrete evidence. They were close to Annie and Frank, so they might have felt concerned. But suggesting a paternity test without proof can be a serious accusation. However, Annie had a history of emotional cheating, which Frank later discovered. The user didn't have direct evidence but had a feeling. \n\nThe user's actions led to Frank seeking a test, which revealed the infidelity. Now, some might argue that the user overstepped by bringing up the test, especially after drinking. Others might say that Frank should have addressed the issue himself if he suspected something. The user's role was to voice a concern, but maybe they shouldn't have been the one to push for a paternity test. \n\nAlso, the user's family is criticizing them, saying they should have kept quiet. The user defends by saying Annie created the situation, which might be true, but the user's suggestion was the catalyst. The child being used as a factor complicates it, but if the marriage was based on deceit, maybe Frank and Annie both have responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user's intent was to help Frank ensure paternity, but the method might have been inappropriate. Without evidence, suggesting a test could be seen as meddling. However, if Annie was indeed unfaithful, then the user's concern was valid. It's a gray area. The user's action led to consequences they didn't intend, but they weren't the one who cheated. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might hinge on whether the user's role was justified. Since they acted on suspicion without proof and it caused the marriage to end, there's an argument they overstepped. But Annie's actions were the root cause. The user might not be entirely wrong, but they might share some responsibility for how they approached it. However, the primary wrongdoer is Annie. The question is if the user is in the wrong. Given that the user's action was a suggestion based on suspicion, which led to the truth coming out, but it's debatable whether they should have stayed out of it. The answer is probably B (Not in the wrong) because the user's intent was to help, even if the method was flawed. The main issue was Annie's infidelity, not the user's concern.\n"
