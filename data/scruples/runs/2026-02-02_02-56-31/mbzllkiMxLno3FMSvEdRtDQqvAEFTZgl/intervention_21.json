I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The story is that their friend Annie married Frank, who's in the oil industry with a work schedule that keeps him away for two weeks on the platform and two off. The user has known Annie since they were babies and considers her more of a sister than their actual sibling. \n\nAnnie and Frank had a baby, but the user suspected something was off. During a visit, after a few beers, the user suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. It's mentioned that Annie was emotionally cheating, though maybe not physically. The user ended up getting blamed for ruining the marriage because they suggested the test. Now, they're isolated by family and friends who think they should've stayed silent. The user is defending their position, saying Annie caused the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user is at fault. The user's main action was suggesting a paternity test. The key point here is whether the user had a right to make that suggestion or if they overstepped. Since they were close to Annie and Frank, maybe they felt responsible for the situation. But how much responsibility does a friend have in such cases? \n\nAnnie's actions were the root cause\u2014she cheated, leading to Frank not being the biological father. The user's suggestion led to the truth coming out. But was it the user's place to bring up paternity? Maybe Frank should've initiated the test himself, but the user's comment triggered it. However, if the user had a valid reason to suspect infidelity based on their long-term relationship with Annie, they might have felt compelled to act. \n\nBut the user's position is that Annie created the situation, so they aren't to blame. The question is whether the user's role in suggesting the test was a mistake. Some might say that while Annie is at fault, the user shouldn't have meddled. Others might argue that they had a right to protect their friend Frank, especially if they knew about the cheating. \n\nThe community's reaction is that the user should've stayed silent. Family and friends are blaming them, but the user believes Annie was the one who created the problem. The user's stance is that the child being used as an excuse is unfair. The isolation is happening because of the user's actions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user's action was a catalyst, but the underlying issue was Annie's infidelity. The user's intention might have been to help Frank, but the method could be questioned. However, without direct evidence, the user might have had no right to intervene. But since they were close and had suspicions, maybe they felt it was their duty. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the user overstepped. The user isn't directly cheating or lying; they're bringing to light a problem caused by someone else. So, while their suggestion led to the breakup, the root cause was Annie's actions. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. The user's suggestion was based on their own suspicions, which could be seen as meddling. However, given the close relationship, maybe it's excusable. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
