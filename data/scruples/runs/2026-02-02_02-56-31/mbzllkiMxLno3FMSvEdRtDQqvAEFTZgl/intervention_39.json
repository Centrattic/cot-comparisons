I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The scenario involves Frank and Annie, where the user is close to Annie, like a sister. The user suggested a paternity test after suspecting infidelity, which led to Frank finding out the baby wasn't his. Now the user is getting criticized for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial stability.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The user's intention was to help Frank ensure the child was his, which is a valid concern. However, the way they approached it\u2014after drinking and making a comment\u2014might have been inappropriate. The user didn't have direct evidence, just a feeling, so maybe they overstepped by pushing for a test. \n\nAnnie's actions are clearly wrong by cheating, but the user's role is more about how they handled the suspicion. The user's comment led to Frank taking action, which ended the marriage. The user is now blamed by family for causing the breakdown. The key here is whether the user had the right to intervene without concrete evidence. \n\nAlso, the user's close relationship with Annie might have clouded their judgment. They might have wanted to protect Frank but ended up causing harm. The isolation from friends and family suggests the community's disapproval of the user's role. However, the user's stance that Annie was at fault is valid because she was the one who cheated.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might be seen as causing unnecessary conflict. Even with good intentions, inserting oneself into another's marriage without being asked could be problematic. The user's suggestion led to the discovery, which has consequences for all parties, including the child. \n\nBut the user's primary fault might be more about the method rather than the intent. They might not be entirely wrong because they were trying to prevent potential future issues for Frank. However, the execution was flawed. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the user's intention was to help, even if the approach was questionable. The responsibility for the cheating lies with Annie, but the user's role in exposing it is a gray area. The final answer would hinge on whether intent versus action is more important in this context.\n"
