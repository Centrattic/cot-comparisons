I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user has a close relationship with Annie, who's like a sister. Frank is in the oil industry with a rotating schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie didn't directly confess to cheating, but the user had suspicions. When they found out there's a baby on the way, the user mentioned a paternity test after some drinks. Frank took the suggestion seriously and got the test, which confirmed the child wasn't his. The user is now facing criticism from family for ruining the marriage. They're standing by Frank, saying Annie created the situation and using the child as a defense is unfair. Both the user and Frank are isolated now, and Frank is moving away.\n\nSo, the key points here: The user's role was suggesting a paternity test. Did they overstep? Well, the user was close to Annie and Frank, and had a feeling something was off. But Annie never confirmed anything. By bringing up the paternity test, even if it was after alcohol, it led to Frank acting on it. The user might have thought they were helping Frank, but maybe they didn't have enough evidence. \n\nThe user's family is blaming them for the marriage breakdown. The user argues Annie was the one who had the affair. But the user's action was the catalyst. Is it the user's fault? It's a tough call. They might have acted on a hunch without proof, which could be seen as interfering. However, they weren't aware of the emotional cheating details. Frank might have been in denial before the test. \n\nIn terms of ethics, supporting the wronged party isn't inherently wrong. But the method of intervention\u2014suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence\u2014could be seen as crossing a line. If the user had no right to meddle in their marriage, then yes, they might be at fault. On the other hand, if they were trying to help a friend (Frank) who was being cheated on, their intentions were good, but the execution might have been flawed. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the user had the right to suggest the test and whether they overstepped their role as a friend. There's also the aspect of emotional cheating versus physical. Even if Annie was emotionally involved, the child's paternity is a separate issue. The user's suggestion led to the test, which exposed the truth, but perhaps the user shouldn't have intervened without more certainty. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user's action was based on suspicion, not proof. They might have been in the right in wanting to help Frank, but the way they approached it could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards them being at least partially responsible, but the situation is complex. However, since the user is defending their stance and the outcome was the husband discovering the truth, it's a bit of a gray area. But in terms of strict right or wrong, if the user didn't have proof and just acted on a feeling, they might be in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
