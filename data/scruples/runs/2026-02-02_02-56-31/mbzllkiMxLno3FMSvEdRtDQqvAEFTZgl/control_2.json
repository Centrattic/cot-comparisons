It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister-in-law, Annie, was unfaithful and had a child with someone else. The author, who's close to both Annie and Frank, suggested a paternity test after some drinks. Frank did the test, found out the kid wasn't his, and the marriage broke down. Now the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the author's actions. They noticed something off about Annie for years but didn't confront her. Instead, they made a comment to Frank while drunk, which he later acted on. The author's intention was probably to help Frank, thinking that if there was a chance the baby wasn't his, a paternity test would clear things up. But did they overstep?\n\nThe key points here are intent and consequences. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating but had a feeling. They might have been trying to do the right thing by Frank, but the way they approached it\u2014drunk and casual\u2014could be problematic. However, they weren't the one who actually committed adultery. The author's comment led to the truth coming out, which led to the marriage ending. But Annie is the one who was unfaithful and had another child. \n\nThe author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage, but the real issue was Annie's infidelity. The author's role was a catalyst, but the underlying problem was there. Did the author have a responsibility to stay silent? If they suspected something, maybe they should have approached it more carefully or waited for Frank to be sober. But they also had a close relationship and were trying to help. \n\nOn the other hand, by suggesting the test, the author might have acted without full information and possibly pushed Frank towards a decision he might not have made otherwise. But Frank did follow through, so he must have had his own suspicions. The author isn't the one who betrayed the marriage. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. They acted on a suspicion and tried to help their friend. The real wrongdoing was Annie's. The author's advice, even if poorly timed, led to uncovering the truth. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
