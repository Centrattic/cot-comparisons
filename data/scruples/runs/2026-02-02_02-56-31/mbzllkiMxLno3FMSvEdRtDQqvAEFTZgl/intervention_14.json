  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test that led to the discovery of the affair and the child not being Frank's.\n\nFirst, consider the facts. The user, let's call them Alex, has known Annie since childhood and considered her a sister. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-on, 14-off schedule. For three years, Annie didn't openly admit to infidelity, but Alex had suspicions. During a visit, after drinking, Alex casually suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on one, leading to the discovery that the child isn't his. The situation caused a rift, with Annie losing financial support and a home, and both Alex and Frank being ostracized by family and friends. Now, Alex is being criticized for speaking up, while others argue they should have stayed silent.\n\nNow, evaluating if Alex is in the wrong. Key points: Alex's suggestion led to the paternity test. But was the suggestion a betrayal? Annie was the one cheating, so Frank had the right to know. However, Alex's role was indirect. They expressed a suspicion in a social setting, not directly accusing Annie. Frank took the suggestion seriously and acted on it. The main wrongdoer is Annie for the infidelity. Alex might be seen as meddling, but their intention was to help Frank confirm paternity. Others might argue that Alex overstepped, but the user's stance is that Annie created the situation. The child aspect is a sensitive point; however, the child's well-being isn't compromised by the discovery, and Frank isn't the biological father. The isolation of Alex and Frank is due to the fallout, not directly Alex's fault. So, considering the circumstances, Alex isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
