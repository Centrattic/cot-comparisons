  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the story is about Frank and Annie. Annie had an affair, and the baby isn't Frank's. The person here, who's close to Annie, suggested a paternity test. Now they're getting blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, the person didn't know for sure Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. They asked Frank about a paternity test after some drinks. The key here is whether the suggestion was justified. Since they had a close relationship with Annie and Frank, maybe they thought they were helping. But did they overstep?\n\nAnnie was the one who was unfaithful, so the person isn't the one who cheated. However, bringing up the paternity test might have accelerated the discovery of the infidelity. But the person didn't know for sure, so maybe they were trying to help Frank confirm his suspicions.\n\nThe person is being blamed by family for speaking up. But Annie's actions led to the situation. The person's intention was probably to help Frank be sure about the baby's paternity. Even though the comment was made after drinking, the person didn't have malicious intent. So, maybe they're not in the wrong because the fault lies more with Annie for cheating. The person's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which might be necessary for Frank to make informed decisions. So, answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
