It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's close to Annie, suspects she's cheating because Frank is away a lot. The author suggests a paternity test during a drunk conversation, which leads Frank to get the test. The result shows the baby isn't his. Now, Annie is without financial support and a home, and the author is being blamed by their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They suspected infidelity but didn't have proof. They approached Frank in a casual, possibly intoxicated setting. The author's intention might have been to help Frank, but their method was indirect and might not have been the best approach. However, they didn't have direct evidence, so suggesting a test could be seen as trying to uncover the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's suggestion led to the breakdown of a marriage. Annie is now facing consequences like losing her home and income. The family is upset with the author for causing this. The author's defense is that Annie created the situation, which might be true, but the author's role is in question. \n\nEthically, if you suspect someone is cheating, how do you handle it? The author didn't confront Annie directly but went through Frank. That might have been a mistake. Maybe they should have encouraged Frank to talk to Annie first before suggesting a test. But the author wasn't in the marriage; their role is as a friend. However, their actions had real consequences.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't know for sure but acted on suspicion, that could be problematic. But if they had a legitimate concern based on long-term observations, maybe they had a reason. The test confirmed the suspicion, so the outcome was inevitable. But the author's intervention might have accelerated the truth coming out, which could be seen as justified. \n\nHowever, the author might be responsible for the fallout because their suggestion led Frank to take action. The family is blaming them, and the author is now isolated. The answer might depend on whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test without being certain. But if the author thought they were helping, maybe they aren't entirely at fault. It's a tricky situation where both the author and Annie have roles in the outcome. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted recklessly or without cause. Here, the author acted on suspicion but had a close relationship with both parties. They might not have the full story, but their intention was to seek the truth. The consequences were severe, but if the marriage was already in trouble, maybe the test was inevitable. It's a close call, but the author might not be entirely at fault because they were trying to help, even if their approach could be questioned.\n"
