It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has known Annie and her family since childhood. Annie married Frank, who's in the oil industry with a long work schedule (14 days on, 14 off). For three years, the author suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't do much because of the distance. Then, when the baby was announced, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank later acted on that, found out the child wasn't his, and the marriage fell apart. Now, the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage and the family is shunning them both. The parents and siblings think the author should have stayed silent, and Frank is moving closer.\n\nThe key points here are the author's suggestion of a paternity test, which led to Frank's insistence on getting one. But the author didn't have direct evidence of infidelity; it was a feeling. So, the question is whether it was right to push for a paternity test without clear proof. \n\nCheating is a serious issue, but the author's approach might be problematic. By suggesting a paternity test without explicit evidence, maybe the author acted on suspicion rather than certainty. If Annie was emotionally cheating, that's different from physical cheating, and the child's paternity being in question adds another layer. However, the author's intention was probably to help Frank discover the truth. \n\nBut Frank had his own reasons for not trusting Annie's emotional cheating. The author's comment, even if made in a casual setting, might have influenced Frank's decision to take it further. However, the author didn't have malicious intent. On the other hand, Annie's actions led to the situation. \n\nThe family is blaming the author for ruining the marriage, but it's Frank who ultimately decided to get the test. The author could argue they were just voicing a suspicion, and Frank had the choice to act on it or not. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the family is upset. \n\nBut then again, if the author didn't have proof, maybe they overstepped by suggesting the test. However, given that Frank suspected something, the author's suggestion might have been the catalyst for him to address it. The blame here is a bit tricky. The main wrongdoer is Annie for cheating, but the author's role in exposing it is being questioned. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's suggestion was a betrayal of Annie's trust without cause. Since the author had a suspicion but no proof, bringing up the paternity test might not be justified. However, it's also a matter of protecting their friend Frank from a potential lie. But the author isn't Frank, so maybe they shouldn't have pushed for it. \n\nAlternatively, the author might have a duty to a close friend if they suspect the spouse is unfaithful. But this is still personal. Without direct evidence, it's hard to say. The family's perspective is that the author caused the breakup, but Frank made the choice. \n\nSo, considering all, the author's action might be seen as well-intentioned but invasive. They might not be in the wrong because the truth came out, but the way they approached it could be questionable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the author was helping Frank uncover the truth, even if it led to a breakup. The main issue is Annie's infidelity, and the author's role was to support Frank. The family's criticism is misplaced here. Frank decided to act on the suggestion, so the author isn't solely at fault. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
