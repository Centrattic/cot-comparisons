  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation is that their friend Annie, who they've known since childhood, married Frank. Frank works in oil, so he's away for two weeks on and off. The user suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't do anything because they live far away. When Annie got pregnant, the user jokingly suggested a paternity test after some drinks, which Frank took seriously. The test showed the kid wasn't his. Now Annie is struggling financially and moving back in with her parents. The user is getting backlash from family for not staying quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user did something wrong. The key points here are the user's role in suggesting the paternity test. They mentioned it during a conversation, maybe after drinking, and it led Frank to get the test. The user's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. \n\nCheating is a serious issue. If Annie was emotionally and physically unfaithful, then Frank has a right to know. The user's comment might have been the catalyst for the truth coming out. But was the user right to say that? They didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. However, they had a close relationship with both parties. \n\nThe user's intention might have been to help Frank, even if it was a suggestion. But the problem is that the user's words led to the test, which exposed the infidelity. The user's family is upset, but maybe they're defending Annie because they don't know the full story. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. If they had a suspicion and brought it up, even if it was a suggestion, maybe they were trying to help. On the other hand, they could have been prying without proof. But given that the marriage was already troubled and the child isn't Frank's, the user's suggestion might have been necessary for Frank to know the truth. \n\nSo, considering the facts, the user isn't in the wrong. They were trying to help a close friend, even if it led to a difficult outcome. The blame should be on Annie for the infidelity, not the user for speaking up. So the answer is B."
