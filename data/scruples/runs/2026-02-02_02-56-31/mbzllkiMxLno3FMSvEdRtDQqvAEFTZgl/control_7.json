It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank, Annie, and the author. Here's the breakdown:\n\nAnnie married Frank, who works in oil with a 14-day on and off schedule. The author has known Annie since childhood and felt like she was more of a sister. The author sensed something off about Annie's marriage but couldn't act on it due to distance. When Frank was about to become a father, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. This led Frank to confirm the baby wasn't his. The author is now blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The author feels Annie was at fault for cheating and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the main question is: Did the author do something wrong by suggesting the paternity test?\n\nFirst, the author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating. They just had a feeling. But they made a comment that led to the test. Is it the author's place to question someone else's spouse about possible infidelity? Usually, people don't have the right to interfere unless they're directly involved. The author isn't Frank's spouse, so maybe they overstepped.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a close relationship with Annie and might have been concerned. But suggesting a paternity test is a serious accusation. Even if the author had suspicions, bringing it up, especially after drinking, could be seen as meddling. Frank acted on that suggestion, which led to the breakdown of his marriage. The author's comment might have been the catalyst.\n\nHowever, the author's intent was to help Frank ensure the child's paternity. But in doing so, they might have violated Annie's privacy and possibly ruined the marriage. The author's family is criticizing them for speaking out, while the author believes Annie was at fault. The situation is complicated because the author's intervention had real consequences.\n\nLegally, unless there was proof of cheating, the author isn't liable. Ethically, it's tricky. The author intruded on a private matter between Frank and Annie. Even if they had suspicions, it's not their place to act as a detective. Frank should have been the one to confront Annie directly, not the author. The fact that the author's comment led to the test and the subsequent fallout might make them partially responsible.\n\nBut it's also possible that the author was trying to help Frank, who might have been unaware of the cheating. If Annie was indeed being unfaithful, the author's action led to the truth coming out. However, the method of intervention was questionable. The author didn't have the right to question Annie's fidelity indirectly through Frank. They should have encouraged Frank to talk to Annie directly instead of suggesting a paternity test.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions were intrusive and may have overstepped their role as a friend. While the outcome might have been necessary for Frank to know the truth, the approach was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
