It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister figure Annie, her husband Frank, and the author suggesting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the author has known Annie since childhood, and Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected Annie might be cheating but couldn't do much from 1000 km away. Then, when the baby was announced, the author, after some beers, asked Frank if he was considering a paternity test. Frank later insisted on it, and it turned out the child isn't his. The author's family is upset, saying they ruined the marriage and should have kept quiet. The author thinks Annie was the one who created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are the suspicion of infidelity, the suggestion of a paternity test, and the aftermath. \n\nThe author didn't have direct evidence; they just had a feeling. But suggesting a paternity test is a serious matter. However, Frank ended up acting on it, and the test proved the child wasn't his. The author's family is blaming them, thinking they shouldn't have said anything. The author's reasoning is that Annie was the one who created the situation (by cheating) and that using the child as a defense is unfair. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the author had a genuine concern based on their history and relationship with Annie, maybe they had the right to voice it. But doing so in a casual setting (after beers) might not have been the best approach. Frank, being an adult, might have needed to address the issues himself. The author's suggestion could have pushed him to confront the situation, which led to the truth coming out. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the author thought it was a possibility, bringing it up without concrete evidence could be seen as crossing a line. Friends and family might not support such a move unless there's clear proof. The author's intention might have been to help, but the method could have been intrusive. \n\nThe family's criticism is about the author ruining the marriage. But if the marriage was already built on deceit (emotional cheating leading to a possible child not being Frank's), maybe the marriage was already in trouble. The author's suggestion could have been a catalyst, but the real issue was Annie's infidelity. \n\nThe author feels isolated now, and Frank is moving. The question is if the author is at fault. If the author acted based on suspicion, not proof, and it led to the breakup, then they might share some blame. However, if the marriage was already in a fragile state due to Annie's actions, the author's role might be less about wrongdoing and more about highlighting existing issues. \n\nSo, possible answer: The author isn't in the wrong because Annie was the one who cheated, and the suggestion came from concern. But the timing and manner might be questioned. However, the outcome (true positive on the test) might mean the author's action was justified. Alternatively, maybe not, since they didn't have proof. \n\nIn some cases, suggesting a paternity test without evidence can be harmful. But here, the result showed the author's suspicion was right. That might mitigate the blame. The family's reaction is about the marriage being ruined, but if it was already doomed because of infidelity, the author isn't entirely at fault. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to make sure. \n\nAnother angle: The author's comment might have caused Frank to act on it, leading to the test. But if the marriage was already in trouble due to emotional cheating, maybe it's Annie's fault. The author's role was a right suggestion, but perhaps they shouldn't have made the comment. However, if the marriage ended because of the test, the fault lies more with Annie. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because their action led to uncovering the truth, but the way they approached it (after beer, casual) might be seen as problematic. But overall, since the suspicion was based on their close relationship and Annie's behavior, it's a judgment call. The key is that the author didn't know for sure and just voiced a concern, which was heeded. The verdict is likely B.\n"
