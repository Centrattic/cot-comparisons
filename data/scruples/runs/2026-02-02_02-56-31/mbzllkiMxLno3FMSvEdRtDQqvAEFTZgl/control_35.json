It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister Annie, her husband Frank, and the author's role in suggesting a paternity test that led to the discovery Frank wasn't the father. The main question is whether the author made a mistake in bringing up the paternity test idea.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author and Annie have been close since childhood. Frank works in oil with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie didn't directly admit to infidelity, but the author had suspicions. When a pregnancy was announced, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on getting one, which revealed the child wasn't his. The author's suggestion came out, leading to family backlash. Now the author is being blamed for ruining the marriage and is facing criticism for Frank being \"immature\" and the child being involved. The author defends their stance, saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are: Did the author have a right to question the paternity? Was there a reasonable suspicion? How does the author's role play into the situation?\n\nThe author mentions having a feeling Annie was seeing someone on the side but couldn't act due to distance. The suggestion of a paternity test was made after drinking, which might have been a careless comment. However, the author's intention was to help Frank confirm his suspicions. But by suggesting it, the author might have planted an idea or acted on an assumption without concrete evidence. \n\nFrank later insisted on the test, so the author's comment was a catalyst. However, the ultimate decision was Frank's. If Frank already had doubts, the author's suggestion might have just accelerated the process. On the other hand, if Frank didn't know, the author's comment could have led to unnecessary conflict. \n\nThe author lives far away and was somewhat removed from the situation. The criticism from family is that the author should have stayed silent. The defense is that Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating. \n\nEthically, is it wrong to question someone's paternity based on a feeling? It's a gray area. Without evidence, it might not be justified, but the author had a longstanding suspicion. However, the way it was brought up (after drinking) might have been inappropriate. \n\nThe author's responsibility here is questionable. They might not be in the wrong if they genuinely believed something was off and wanted to help Frank. However, without evidence, it's possible the author overstepped. The fact that Frank took the suggestion seriously and pursued the test suggests he had his own doubts. \n\nIn terms of the consequences, the marriage broke down, and the author is being blamed. But if Annie was indeed unfaithful and the child isn't Frank's, then the author's intervention might have been necessary to uncover the truth. The author isn't responsible for Annie's actions, but their comment did play a role in revealing the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help based on their suspicions. However, the manner in which it was done (after drinking, not having concrete evidence) could be seen as contributing to the problem. But ultimately, the decision to pursue the paternity test was Frank's. Therefore, the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
