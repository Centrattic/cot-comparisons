  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. So, there's Frank and Annie, married for three years. The person in question is close to Annie, like a sister. Frank works in oil, so he's away for two weeks, on and off. The user felt something was off, maybe cheating, but didn't have proof. Then when a baby is coming, the user suggests a paternity test after some drinks. That led Frank to get a test, which showed the kid wasn't his. Now Annie is without Frank's income and has to move in with her parents. The user is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, the user's intention: they were concerned about their friend Annie and her marriage. They didn't have direct evidence of cheating but had a feeling. They made a suggestion to Frank after drinking, which he took seriously. The key here is whether the user overstepped by suggesting the paternity test. \n\nBut wait, if Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe Frank had some suspicions too. The user's suggestion might have been the catalyst, but if the marriage was already in trouble, maybe the test was inevitable. The user's role was to express a concern, even if it wasn't certain. However, the user didn't have proof, just a feeling. That could be seen as meddling.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating. The user's suggestion led to uncovering the truth, which is in Frank's favor in the long run. But the immediate consequences are harsh for Annie and the child. The user's family is blaming them for causing the divorce and the financial instability. Is the user responsible for that? They didn't force the test; Frank chose to do it after the suggestion. The user might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank, but the method of doing so without concrete evidence could be questionable. However, the user's actions were based on concern for their friend and the unborn child. \n\nAlso, the user lives far away and was somewhat distant from the situation. They might not have known all the details. The fact that Frank later admitted emotional cheating suggests there was some validity to the user's concerns. So maybe the user isn't entirely at fault. But did they have the right to suggest the test without being sure? Maybe not. But in the end, the truth came out. The answer might be B, not wrong, because the user was trying to protect the child and Frank's future, even if the method was a bit impulsive.\n"
