  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The story involves Frank and Annie, where the user's suggestion led Frank to get a paternity test, revealing the child isn't his. Now the user is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The user's role was to express a suspicion they had, which they did after some drinks. But was it their place to bring up the paternity test idea? Maybe they thought they were helping Frank by voicing their concern, even if it was based on a feeling without concrete evidence. However, suggesting a paternity test is a serious step that can have huge consequences. It's possible the user overstepped by not having proof and just acting on a suspicion, even if well-intentioned.\n\nAnnie's actions are clearly wrong here\u2014cheating and having a child with someone else is a betrayal. But the user's involvement is the question. They didn't have direct evidence, just a feeling. Maybe they should have kept it to themselves instead of pushing Frank to take such a drastic step. The fact that Frank decided to act on the suggestion complicates things. He made the choice to get the test, so the user might not be entirely at fault, but their words did trigger the situation.\n\nThe user is now being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. The user is defending their stance, saying Annie created the situation. It's tricky because while Annie is clearly at fault, the user's role in exposing the cheating might have caused immediate harm to the marriage. The user might have thought they were helping, but the consequences were severe. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? They didn't force Frank to take the test, but their suggestion was the catalyst. In some perspectives, they had no right to interfere without evidence. However, they were close to both parties and had a sisterly bond with Annie, so their concern might have been genuine. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the user overstepped by making the suggestion without proof. Since they had a suspicion but no evidence, bringing it up could be seen as meddling. But in another light, they might have been trying to help Frank realize the truth. It's a gray area, but since the user's action led to the breakdown, even if indirectly, there's a case to be made that they contributed. However, the primary fault lies with Annie. So, the user might not be entirely in the wrong, but they did play a role. However, the question is if the user is in the wrong. The answer would be B (No) because they were trying to help Frank discover the truth, even if it led to the breakup. The main responsibility is on Annie, not the user for suggesting a test based on their own suspicions.\n"
