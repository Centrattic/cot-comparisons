It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's sister, Annie, married Frank. Frank was away for 14 days on and 14 off because of his job in the oil industry. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't know for sure. When Annie got pregnant, the author, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, and the test confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and a home, and the author is getting criticized for speaking up.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author had a right to mention the paternity test. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating, but had a feeling. The comment was made in a casual setting (after drinking), but it led Frank to take action. The author's intention might have been to help Frank verify the child's parentage, but the method was questionable.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the author was concerned about the situation and maybe felt that the child might not be Frank's. However, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as meddling. On the other hand, the author had a close relationship with Annie and Frank, so maybe they felt responsible to speak up. \n\nBut Frank ended up being wronged. By suggesting the test, the author might have caused unnecessary harm. Even if Annie was cheating, the author's comment led to the breakdown of the marriage. The author's friends and family are criticizing them for ruining a good marriage. The author is defending themselves by saying Annie created the situation, but the action taken (suggesting the test) was still theirs.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on the actions of the person asking. The author's action here was a suggestion that had significant consequences. Even if the intention was good, the result was harmful. So, the author might be considered at fault for not keeping their mouth shut. On the other hand, if the author genuinely believed the child wasn't Frank's, maybe they had a right to express concern. But since they didn't have proof, it's a gray area. \n\nI think the key here is that the author acted on a suspicion without evidence, which can be seen as crossing a line. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because they meddled in a situation where they didn't have all the facts, leading to the marital breakdown.\n"
