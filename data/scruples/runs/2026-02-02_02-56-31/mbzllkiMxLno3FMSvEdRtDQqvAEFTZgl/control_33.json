It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about Frank and Annie. The author is the one who told Frank to consider a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out Annie was cheating, emotionally and perhaps physically. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and moving back with her parents. The author is getting flak from family for causing the marriage breakdown, but they feel Annie was at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out whether the author's action of suggesting the paternity test was wrong. The key points here are the author's intent and the consequences. The author mentions they had a feeling something was off but weren't sure. They suggested the test after a few beers, which might have been a casual comment. However, it turned out that the author's suggestion stuck and led Frank to push for the test, which confirmed his fears.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author wasn't directly involved in the cheating, but they did act on their suspicion. But they were friends with both parties and had known Annie since childhood. They might have felt a sense of responsibility or concern for Frank. However, suggesting a paternity test is a serious accusation, even if it's just a suggestion. If there was no solid evidence, maybe that was a breach of privacy or trust.\n\nBut wait, the author's parents and siblings think they should have kept quiet. However, the author argues that Annie created the situation. The author might believe that Frank had the right to know the truth, especially about his child's paternity. Paternity is a huge issue, so maybe the author was trying to protect Frank's interests. However, the author wasn't certain and just made a casual comment. Sometimes, even a careless remark can lead to significant consequences. \n\nBut considering that Annie was emotionally cheating and the child isn't Frank's, maybe the marriage was already on shaky ground. The author's suggestion might have just been the catalyst. However, is the author responsible for the fallout? The author didn't know for sure, but acted on a suspicion. It's possible that the author overstepped by suggesting something so serious without concrete evidence. Friends can offer support, but advising someone to take such a drastic step could be crossing a line, especially if it's not based on facts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Frank should have been more proactive in checking the situation himself. The author's role here is complicated. They were a close friend, so they might have thought they were helping. However, the impact on Annie's life, like losing her home and income, is significant. The question is whether the author's actions were justified. If the author had more evidence, maybe they would be in the right, but since it was just a feeling, perhaps not. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, is the author to blame for the marriage breaking up? It's a tough call. The author acted out of concern but without certainty. The consequences were severe, but Annie was the one who cheated. The author's parents are blaming them, but maybe the author is not entirely at fault. The answer might depend on cultural or personal ethics. In some perspectives, the author was just trying to help and isn't responsible for the outcome. In others, they might be seen as meddlesome. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank uncover the truth, which he eventually did. However, if the author's suggestion was baseless and caused unnecessary harm, then A (Yes). But given that Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the author's intentions were good, even if the method was flawed. The key is whether the author had a right to intervene. Since they were close friends, maybe they did. But the way they did it might be questionable. But overall, the cheating was on Annie's part, so the author isn't the wrongdoer here.\n"
