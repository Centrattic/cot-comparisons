  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation involves their close friend Annie, who they've known since childhood. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. The user noticed something off and, after some prompting, got Frank to consider a paternity test, which confirmed the kid wasn't his. Now, the user is being criticized by their family for \"ruining a good marriage\" and causing Annie to lose her financial stability.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the user's actions. They didn't directly accuse Annie but suggested a paternity test after being close to Frank. The user's intention was likely to help Frank confirm his suspicions. However, the user is being blamed for the fallout. The key points here are intent, actions, and consequences.\n\nThe user's role was to support Frank, who was cheated on. The paternity test revealed the infidelity, which Annie had been hiding. The user isn't the one who cheated; they merely encouraged Frank to verify. The blame on the user seems misplaced because the responsibility lies with Annie for her actions. The user's actions were based on concern for Frank, and while the method might be questionable (suggesting a test without more evidence), the intent was to help a friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's suggestion did lead to the breakdown of the marriage. However, it was Frank who ultimately decided to take action after the user's comment. The user might not be at fault since they were acting on feelings and trying to help. The family's criticism that the user should have kept quiet overlooks the fact that Annie was the one who created the situation through infidelity.\n\nAlso, the user is being isolated, which adds to the emotional burden. The argument that the user ruined the marriage is unfair because Annie's actions were the root cause. The user's role was to uncover the truth, which Frank then acted upon. The child being used as a point against the user is also problematic since the child's paternity is a direct result of Annie's cheating.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's approach might have been tactless, the main responsibility for the cheating lies with Annie. The user's intentions were to support a friend who was wronged. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for trying to help Frank discover the truth.\n"
