I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is close to Annie, who was married to Frank. Frank was in the oil industry with long work shifts. The user suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't do much from afar. When the baby came, the user suggested a paternity test after a few drinks, which led Frank to get the test. The child wasn't his, and now the marriage is over. The user is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, while they think Annie was the one who created the situation. They're also facing isolation and Frank is moving to their city.\n\nSo, the key points here: the user expressed a suspicion, which led to the paternity test. But was that their right to do? Did they overstep? Well, the user's parents and siblings are upset because the user spoke up, but the user believes Annie was the one at fault. \n\nI need to consider if the user had the right to bring up the paternity test idea. Since Frank and Annie were married, Frank might have the right to know if the child is his. The user's role here is a friend. Friends sometimes have to be honest, but in this case, the user's comment was after drinking. However, the fact remains that the discovery of the infidelity and the subsequent breakup might have been inevitable. The user's suggestion could have accelerated the process, but the underlying issue (infidelity) was already there. \n\nThe user's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. But the real issue here is the cheating and the lie. The user's action was a catalyst, but the marriage was already broken. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for speaking up, especially since it was their friend who was being deceived. However, maybe the user could have handled it differently, like talking to Frank more privately or not bringing it up while drunk. But the outcome was that the truth came out, which might be for the best in the long run. \n\nThe user is also standing by their belief that Annie was the one who created the situation, which is true. The user isn't the one who cheated; they just brought up a concern. So, they might not be in the wrong. The family's criticism is misplaced because the fault lies with Annie. The user's support for Frank is justified given the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of the answer, the user is not in the wrong. They acted on a suspicion, which turned out to be true. The real wrongdoer is Annie. The user's action, while perhaps tactless, was based on concern for their friend. So, the answer would be B.\n"
