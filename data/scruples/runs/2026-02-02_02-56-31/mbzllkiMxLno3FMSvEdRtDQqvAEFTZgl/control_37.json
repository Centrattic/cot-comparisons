It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage, where Annie cheated, leading to Frank finding out about the affair and the child not being his. The author, who's close friends with both, suggested a paternity test, which led to the breakup and a lot of fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew Annie for a long time, lived far away, and had a feeling she was cheating but couldn't do much. Then, when they found out about the pregnancy, the author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, got the test, and it turned out the child wasn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage and causing issues. The author feels Annie was the one who created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B) answer. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's action was suggesting a paternity test, which led to Frank getting it. The author might argue that they were trying to help Frank avoid being duped, especially since they had a feeling Annie was cheating. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence, just suspicion. By bringing it up, even if it was in a casual setting (after beers), they might have overstepped. \n\nOn the other hand, Frank later took the suggestion seriously and acted on it, which led to the truth coming out. The author's intention could be seen as trying to protect Frank from being a cuckold, but the method might have been inappropriate. The author didn't have proof, just a feeling, and maybe they shouldn't have pushed Frank to take such a drastic step without more evidence.\n\nBut then, maybe Frank was already considering it, and the author's comment just gave him the push he needed. However, the author's role in the breakdown is significant because their suggestion led to the test, which caused the marriage to end. The author's family is blaming them because they think they shouldn't have interfered.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author had no concrete evidence and just acted on a hunch, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as meddling. Even if Annie was indeed cheating, the author's interference directly caused the marriage to disintegrate. So, the author might be at fault for not letting Frank handle it himself without external influence. Alternatively, if the author believed they were helping Frank protect himself, maybe they're not entirely wrong.\n\nBut in relationships, unless you have clear evidence, suggesting such a thing can be harmful. The author might have crossed a line. Also, the fact that Annie was emotionally cheating and then had a child with another man is clearly her fault. The author's role is more nuanced. They acted on suspicion, which led to consequences. It's possible the author isn't entirely wrong, but maybe partially responsible. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't have proof and their suggestion caused the breakdown, perhaps they are at fault. But if the marriage was already on shaky ground and the author just exposed the truth, maybe not. It's a tough call. But the typical AITA analysis might lean towards the person who meddled without evidence being partially at fault. So, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is wrong) because they acted on suspicion without evidence, leading to the marriage's end. Alternatively, B (No) if they were trying to help expose the cheating. Hmm. The key is whether the author overstepped. The answer might be A because they shouldn't have pushed for the test without more certainty.\n"
