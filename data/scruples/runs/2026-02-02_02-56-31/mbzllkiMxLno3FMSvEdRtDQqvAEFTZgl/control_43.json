It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation involves Frank, Annie, and the author. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has been close friends with Annie since childhood. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. The author suspects Annie is cheating but doesn't have direct evidence. The author mentions during a visit, after drinking, that Frank might consider a paternity test. This suggestion later leads Frank to get a test, which confirms the child isn't his. The author is now being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, and the author feels Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting the paternity test. Let's look at the details. The author didn't have concrete proof of infidelity but had a feeling. They made a comment in a social setting (after drinks) to Frank. The comment was about paternity, which then led Frank to take action. The author's intent might have been to help Frank, but the outcome was a broken marriage and personal consequences for everyone involved.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, does the author have a right to intervene? Well, the author was close to both parties, but they weren't in a position to know the full story. They acted on a suspicion, not proof. Even though they were trying to help, their suggestion was the catalyst for Frank's actions. The author's friends and family are upset because the marriage was broken up, and the child is now in a difficult situation. \n\nHowever, the author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation through cheating. But the author's role was more of a suggestion that led to the discovery. The question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the paternity test. Maybe they had a right to be concerned given their close relationship, but they didn't have all the facts. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's comment was in a casual setting, and Frank might have already had doubts. The author's intention was to help, but it's possible Frank might have not acted on it if the author hadn't mentioned it. The author is now facing backlash, but is that fair? Did they have the right to intervene without evidence?\n\nIn some perspectives, the author was wrong to bring up the suggestion without evidence, even if it was out of concern. In others, it's understandable to want to help a friend in a potential bad situation. But the fact that the author was close to Annie and Frank complicates things. The author's comment might have been a breach of privacy or trust, even if unintended. \n\nThe key points here are the lack of evidence, the casual context of the suggestion, and the resulting fallout. The author might be in the wrong because they acted on a suspicion rather than facts, which led to the marriage's breakdown. However, if Annie was indeed unfaithful and the child isn't Frank's, the author's action might be seen as preventing a long-term issue. But the method of intervention could be questionable.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted on a suspicion without evidence, leading to the marriage's collapse, even if their intentions were to help. However, there's a gray area because the truth was revealed, but the way they approached it might have been inappropriate."
