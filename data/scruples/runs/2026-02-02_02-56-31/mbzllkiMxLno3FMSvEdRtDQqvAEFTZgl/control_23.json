It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's close to Annie, found out that Frank might not be the father of the child and suggested a paternity test. This led to the marriage breaking down, and now the author is being criticized for causing the problem.\n\nFirst, the author's role here. They were a close friend to both Annie and Frank. They noticed something off but couldn't act on it because they were far away. When they did visit, they casually mentioned a paternity test while drunk. That led Frank to actually get the test, which confirmed the infidelity. Now, the author feels they did the right thing by uncovering the cheating, while others think they shouldn't have said anything.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author overstep by suggesting the test? The author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. But they were close to both parties. Even if they were concerned, was it their place to bring it up? Frank and Annie were married; their issues should have been handled between them. The author's suggestion, even if well-intentioned, might have been an intrusion into their marriage. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation. They might have been trying to help Frank, but they were close to Annie too. Maybe they wanted to protect Frank from being cheated on, but in doing so, they caused a public scandal. The fallout affected not just Frank and Annie but also the author's family and friends.\n\nAnother angle: The child being used as a pawn. The author argues that Annie created the situation, but the child is innocent. However, the child's parentage is the core issue here. By causing the marriage to end, the child's life is uprooted. The author's action might have unintended consequences on the child's life.\n\nBut wait, the cheating was already happening. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out. If Frank had stayed in the marriage, he might have continued being deceived. So, was the author's action a necessary evil to reveal the infidelity?\n\nHowever, the author didn't have proof. It was just a feeling. They might have acted prematurely. Even if they were right, the way they approached it\u2014during a drinking session\u2014might have been unwise. Also, they might not have considered the emotional impact of the paternity test on Frank and Annie.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the adulterous party is Annie. The author's role is more of a catalyst in exposing the truth. But in relationships, third parties shouldn't intervene unless directly asked or if there's immediate harm. The author's intervention, though it led to the truth, might have been an overreach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't commit infidelity, but their action led to the marriage's collapse. The question is whether they had the right to intervene. Since they were friends and had a suspicion, maybe they thought they were helping. But in reality, they might have meddled where they shouldn't have. The answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nBut considering that the author didn't know for sure and acted on a hunch, maybe it's not entirely their fault. The main wrongdoer is Annie. The author's action was a result of concern, even if it was misguided. However, the fact that they brought up the paternity test without evidence could be seen as overstepping, leading to the breakup. Therefore, the author might share some blame, but is it enough to be in the wrong? It's a gray area. The answer could be A (yes) because they shouldn't have intervened, or B (no) because they were trying to help. But traditional advice often says not to interfere in others' relationships unless asked. So maybe A.\n"
