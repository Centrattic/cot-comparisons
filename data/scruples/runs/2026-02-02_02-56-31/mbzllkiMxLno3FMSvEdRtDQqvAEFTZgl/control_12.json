It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's a close friend of both, suspected Annie was cheating because Frank was away a lot for work. The author casually suggested a paternity test after drinking, and Frank took it seriously, leading to the discovery that the child isn't his. Now, the author is facing backlash for \"ruining\" the marriage, and the question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cheating, especially emotional and physical, is a betrayal. The author's role here is tricky. They had a suspicion but no concrete evidence. By suggesting a paternity test, the author might have acted on a hunch without knowing for sure. However, the test revealed the truth, which led Frank to leave. \n\nIs the author responsible for Frank's decision? Well, the author's suggestion was just that\u2014a suggestion. Frank was the one who pursued the test and confronted Annie. The author didn't force Frank's hand. But since they're close friends, the author might have overstepped by bringing it up, especially without evidence. However, the alternative is letting Frank be in a marriage where his wife was unfaithful and lying, which is also harmful.\n\nThe community's reaction is split. Some might say the author was meddling, while others might see it as a moral duty to point out potential deceit. The key points are: the author had a suspicion based on years of observation, they didn't have proof, and the test confirmed the suspicion. So, the author's action led to the truth coming out, which might have been painful but necessary. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong for assuming and acting on a suspicion without evidence, possibly causing unnecessary harm. On the flip side, Annie's actions were the real source of the problem. The author's suggestion was a catalyst, but the responsibility lies more with Annie for the infidelity. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person who acts on suspicion without proof can be seen as the asshole, but if they're exposing a betrayal, it's more complex. The author's intention was to help a friend, which is well-meaning, but the method might be questionable. Ultimately, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong, they might share some responsibility for not having concrete evidence before suggesting the test. But since the truth was revealed and Frank made the choice to act, the main blame is on Annie. The author's role is a gray area, but given the outcome, they might be justified in their actions despite the fallout.\n"
