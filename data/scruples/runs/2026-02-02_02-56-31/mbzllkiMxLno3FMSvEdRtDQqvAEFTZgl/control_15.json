It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this, the author, is in the wrong. The situation is complicated.\n\nSo, the author's sister, Annie, is married to Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author noticed that Annie might be cheating, but never had direct evidence. Later, when Annie gets pregnant, the author casually suggests a paternity test while they're drunk. Frank ends up getting the test, which confirms the baby isn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe author is defending their actions, saying Annie was at fault and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. The family is upset and they feel the author shouldn't have said anything. The author is isolated and sticking to their position.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's responsibility in bringing up the paternity test. Did the author overstep? Well, the author had a suspicion based on years of feeling something was off. But they didn't have proof. By suggesting the test, even though it was offhand, it led to Frank taking action. However, if Annie was actually cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then the author might have done the right thing in exposing the betrayal. But was it their place to bring it up? The author is a close friend, almost like a sister. Maybe they were concerned, but they weren't in a position to know for sure. However, if they had a good reason to suspect infidelity, maybe they had a duty to tell Frank. But without evidence, it's risky. The problem is that the author's comment led to the test, which proved the infidelity. But the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if they truly believed there was a problem and acted on a hunch, maybe they weren't wrong. But they didn't have proof, and bringing it up in a casual, drunk manner might not have been the best approach. However, the outcome was that the truth came out, which might have been necessary for Frank. On the other hand, the author didn't have a right to meddle in their marriage unless it was causing harm. But since the child wasn't Frank's, keeping that secret might have caused more harm in the long run. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank see the truth, even though they went about it in a questionable way. The wrongdoer here is Annie for cheating. The author's intentions were to uncover the truth, which led to the right outcome. So answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
