It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The story is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sister. Frank was away a lot for work, and the author suspected Annie was cheating. The author casually mentioned a paternity test after some drinks, which led Frank to confirm the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without financial support and the author is being blamed by family for breaking up the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's intention was to voice a suspicion based on their long-term relationship with Annie. The comment was made in a social setting, not maliciously. However, it resulted in the paternity test that exposed the cheating. The family is upset because the author's words led to the breakup, affecting Annie and the child. \n\nBut then, Annie was in the wrong for cheating. The author felt compelled to speak up because they had close ties with both Frank and Annie. Even though the author might have thought their comment would be taken in passing, it actually prompted Frank to act. The author is now being criticized for not staying silent, but is that fair?\n\nThe question is whether the author's action was wrong. The author had a suspicion, and while the method (bringing it up after drinking) might not be the best, the intent was to ensure Frank's child was his. The author didn't have concrete evidence but acted on a feeling. However, in relationships, people sometimes make decisions based on intuition. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached it differently, maybe by talking to Frank privately without the alcohol. But the outcome shows that the suspicion was valid. The author's family is blaming them, but Frank is the one who was wronged. The author's support for Frank after the infidelity was discovered might be justified because Frank was the victim. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to bring up the paternity test suggestion. Since they were close to Annie and Frank, they might have felt responsible. However, the author's comment did lead to the test, which caused the breakup. But Annie's cheating was the real issue. The author's role was to express concern, but maybe they overstepped. However, given the outcome, the author's action was based on a valid suspicion and led to the truth being uncovered. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to address a legitimate concern, even if the approach could have been better. The main issue was Annie's infidelity, not the author's suggestion.\n"
