  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user's sister-figure, Annie, married Frank, who works in oil and has a schedule of two weeks on, two weeks off. Over three years, the user felt something was off but couldn't act on it. Then, when they found out Annie was pregnant, the user suggested a paternity test during a drunk conversation. Frank took the test, which revealed the child wasn't his, and he had been emotionally cheated on. Now Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The user is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage and is isolated because of it.\n\nThe user's question is whether they were wrong to support Frank. Let me consider the ethical angles here. The user wasn't directly involved but had a long-standing relationship with Annie. They noticed something and acted on it, even if it was a suggestion during a conversation. The key points are: the user's concern for Frank's situation, the suggestion leading to the paternity test, and the aftermath.\n\nOn one hand, the user might argue they were protecting Frank from being a father to another man's child, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by making the suggestion, even if it was based on a feeling. Did they have evidence? The user says they had a feeling but no direct proof. So, maybe their action was based on suspicion rather than certainty. However, Frank did get the test, which confirmed the infidelity, so the user's intuition was right.\n\nThe user's family is blaming them for the breakup, thinking they shouldn't have said anything. But if Annie was indeed cheating, the user's role in revealing the truth might be justified. The emotional cheating aspect also matters\u2014Frank was blindsided, and the user's suggestion led to the truth coming out.\n\nThe user's support for Frank is seen as taking sides, but given the cheating and the child not being Frank's, the user's position is defensible. The isolation and blame from the family might be because they're trying to protect Annie, but the user isn't in the wrong for supporting the truth. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong). The user acted on their concerns, and while the method might be debatable, the outcome was uncovering the infidelity, which justified their actions. The user isn't responsible for Annie's choices, and supporting Frank in this case is reasonable.\n"
