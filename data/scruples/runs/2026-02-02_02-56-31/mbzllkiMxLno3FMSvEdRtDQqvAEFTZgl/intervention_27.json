  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation involves their sister figure, Annie, who had an affair. The user's suggestion led Frank to get a paternity test, which revealed the baby wasn't his. Now, the user is getting criticized for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial support.\n\nFirst, the user's intent wasn't malicious. They felt something was off and were concerned about Frank's child. But the way they approached it\u2014making a comment after drinking\u2014might have been tactless. However, the main issue is whether the user is responsible for the consequences. Annie's infidelity and the resulting child not being Frank's are her actions. The user's comment prompted Frank to take action, but he was already suspicious, as he later insisted on the test. \n\nThe user isn't the one who cheated; they were just a concerned friend. The parents and siblings are blaming the user for exposing the truth, but Annie is the one who created the situation. The user's actions led to a resolution, though it caused disruption. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether their comment was justified. Since they had concerns and Frank acted on them, maybe the user isn't at fault. However, maybe they should have kept their mouth shut, especially since it was a sensitive topic and they weren't as close as Frank was. But given the outcome, the blame might lie more with Annie than the user. So, likely, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
