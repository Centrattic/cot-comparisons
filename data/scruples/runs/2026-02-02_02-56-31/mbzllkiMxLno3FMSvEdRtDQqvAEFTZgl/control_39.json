It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Annie, who's been emotionally cheating on Frank, and the author suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out the baby wasn't his. Now the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author knew Annie and Frank since childhood and acted as a sister. The author noticed something off but couldn't act on it due to distance. When Frank was going to be a father, the author suggested a paternity test, which Frank later insisted on. The test revealed the child wasn't his. Now, the author's family is blaming them for breaking up the marriage.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the author was concerned about the situation and tried to look out for Frank. The suggestion of a paternity test might have been a way to confirm Frank's suspicions, especially since he's in a job that's away from home often. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. But maybe their intention was good\u2014to prevent Frank from being deceived further.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's suggestion led to the breakdown of the marriage. But was the author overstepping? They might not have all the facts and acted on a hunch. The question is whether suggesting a paternity test, even if based on a feeling, is appropriate. Also, the author's family is criticizing them, but maybe they're in the right for trying to help a friend.\n\nIt's a tough call. The author didn't force Frank to take the test; he decided it after the suggestion. So the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. The main issue is that Annie was the one who engaged in the infidelity and deception. The author's role was to voice a concern, which might be seen as meddling, but with good intentions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, the person who causes the problem is the one at fault. Here, Annie is the cheater. The author tried to alert Frank, which could be seen as helping him. However, the method of suggesting a paternity test after drinking might not have been the best approach. But given the circumstances, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author was trying to help and the main wrongdoing was by Annie.\n"
