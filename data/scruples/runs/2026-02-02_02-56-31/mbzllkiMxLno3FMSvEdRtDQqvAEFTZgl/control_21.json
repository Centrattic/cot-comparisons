It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's best friend Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on and off schedule. The author felt for years that Annie was cheating but couldn't do anything because of the distance. Then, when Annie got pregnant, the author, after some beers, suggested a paternity test to Frank. Frank took it seriously, did the test, and found out the baby wasn't his. Now the author is getting blamed by family for breaking up the marriage, and Frank is moving away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had suspicions but didn't have concrete evidence. They made a comment while drunk, which Frank later acted on. The question is whether the author overstepped. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping Frank by bringing up the paternity test. If they genuinely believed Annie was cheating and the child wasn't Frank's, maybe they felt it was the right thing to do. But they didn't have proof, just a feeling. That's a problem. Also, the author's suggestion led to the test, which caused the breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't in a position to know for sure. They might have thought they were protecting Frank from being cheated on and potentially raising a child that's not his. However, the method of bringing it up\u2014after drinking and making a suggestion that led to a test\u2014could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nThen there's the aftermath. The author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage. But the main issue is Annie's infidelity and the child not being Frank's. The author's role was the catalyst, but the real problem is Annie's actions. However, the author's comment was the direct cause of the test. \n\nAnother angle: even if the author had good intentions, they shouldn't have meddled without evidence. It's possible that Frank would have never found out the truth if the author hadn't suggested the test. But in that case, Frank might have continued the marriage while being cheated on. \n\nBut the author is a close friend, so maybe they had the right to be concerned. However, the way they approached it\u2014casually during a drunken conversation\u2014might have been irresponsible. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that it's Annie's fault for creating the situation. That's true, but the author's action still played a role in the breakup. So is the author at fault? It depends on whether their action was an overreach. They didn't have evidence, just a suspicion. Friends might have a duty to look out for each other, but suggesting a paternity test without proof could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe. They acted on a suspicion without proof, which led to a breakup. Even if their intention was good, the method might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong). But others might argue that they were just trying to help, so B (no) is possible. \n\nBut considering that the author's action directly led to the test and the subsequent breakup, and they had no solid evidence, it's more likely that they overstepped. So the answer would be A.\n"
