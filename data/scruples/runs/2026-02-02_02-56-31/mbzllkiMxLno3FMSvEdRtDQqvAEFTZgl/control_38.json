It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about supporting a husband who was cheated on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. Frank and Annie are married. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author, who's close to Annie, suspects she's having an affair but doesn't have proof. Later, when Annie is pregnant, the author suggests a paternity test, which leads to Frank finding out the baby isn't his. The author is now criticized by family for \"ruining\" the marriage and causing Annie and Frank to be isolated. The author feels Annie was at fault and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank after this. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's role here is as a friend to both Annie and Frank. The author made a suggestion that led to the discovery of the infidelity. But was the author justified in doing so? Did the author overstep? \n\nOn one hand, the author might have been trying to be honest with Frank, even if it caused conflict. On the other hand, the author might not have enough evidence to make such a suggestion, which could be seen as interfering. However, the author's intention was to help Frank, not to harm Annie. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to question Frank? Was the suggestion of a paternity test a responsible action given the suspicion? The author wasn't directly accusing Annie but was voicing a concern based on feelings. However, since the author was close to both, their input might have carried weight. \n\nBut in the end, the paternity test revealed the truth, which Frank acted on. The author's suggestion was honest, even if it was made after drinking. The author might not be at fault because they were trying to help Frank seek the truth. However, some might argue that the author shouldn't have intervened without more concrete evidence, leading to the breakdown of the marriage. \n\nThe family is blaming the author for the fallout, but it's Frank's decision to take the test and leave that caused the separation. The author's role was a catalyst but not the direct cause. So, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the suggestion was justified. Since the author had suspicions based on a long-term friendship, maybe they had a right to be concerned. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they were acting in what they believed to be Frank's best interest, even if it led to unintended consequences. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
