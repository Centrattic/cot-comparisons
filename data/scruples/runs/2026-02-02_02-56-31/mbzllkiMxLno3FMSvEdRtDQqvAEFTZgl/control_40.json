It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is Frank's sister, close to both, and she suspects Annie of cheating. When Frank is off work, maybe he's away for 14 days on the platform, so maybe Annie had opportunities when he wasn't around. The author mentions she didn't know for sure but had a feeling. Then when they found out there's a baby on the way, the author, after some beers, suggests a paternity test. That led to Frank getting the test, which revealed the kid isn't his. Now Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back in with her parents. The author is getting blamed by her family for ruining the marriage and Frank is isolated.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. Did she have a reason to suspect Annie? She says Annie never said directly but the author had a feeling. Maybe she had some indirect evidence. But acting on a suspicion might be problematic. However, the author's intention was to help Frank. If Annie was emotionally cheating and the baby isn't his, then maybe Frank was being deceived. But the author's role in bringing up the paternity test is the key here. She brought up the idea, which led to the test. But perhaps Frank was already considering it, and she just pushed him to take action. \n\nIs it the author's fault for bringing up the suggestion? Well, if she had no evidence and just acted on a feeling, that could be crossing a line. But if she genuinely believed there was a problem and Frank was already thinking about it, maybe she's in the right to support her friend. The family is blaming her for ruining the marriage, but if Annie was cheating, then the marriage was already in trouble. The author might be defending her sister-in-law, but if she knew about emotional cheating, maybe she had a right to help Frank. \n\nAlso, the child aspect is being used against the author. But if the child isn't Frank's, maybe it's Annie's responsibility to take care of it. The author argues that Annie created the situation. So, the author's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth. Even if it caused a breakup, if Annie was the one cheating, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe she shouldn't have made the suggestion without more concrete proof. However, in these situations, sometimes people act on suspicions. The fact that Frank followed through on the test suggests he had doubts too. So maybe the author isn't at fault here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
