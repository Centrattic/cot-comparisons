  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation involves their sister-like friend Annie, who married Frank. The user has known both since childhood.\n\nFirst, the user noticed something off during Frank's absence due to his job. They didn't have direct evidence of infidelity but had a feeling. When a baby was on the way, the user, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously and found out the child wasn't his. Now, the user is getting blamed for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her home and Frank's income.\n\nThe user's side is that Annie created the situation by cheating, and they're standing by Frank. The family is criticizing the user for speaking up. The user feels they're not in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, they didn't have proof, just a suspicion. They made a comment in a social setting, which led to the paternity test. But they didn't know about the emotional cheating beforehand. They weren't trying to cause harm, just voice a concern they had. However, the method of bringing it up informally might have been problematic. But since they couldn't do much from afar, maybe their intention was valid. The key points are lack of direct evidence, the suggestion leading to the test, and the aftermath. The user's parents blame them, but the user believes Annie is at fault. It's tricky because the user acted on a suspicion without knowing the full story, but their intent wasn't malicious. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to protect their friend's family, even if the method wasn't perfect.\n"
