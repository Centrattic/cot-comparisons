It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend (Annie) who married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a two-week on, two-week off schedule. The author of the story, let's call them the narrator, has been close to Annie since childhood and considers her more like a sister. The key points are:\n\n1. The narrator suspected Annie might be seeing someone else but didn't have concrete proof. They were 1000 km away, so couldn't intervene much.\n2. When Annie got pregnant, the narrator, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank later did get the test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. The narrator's suggestion came back to haunt them, leading to family conflict and isolation.\n3. The narrator is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. They argue that Annie was at fault, and they feel the focus on the child is unfair. Now Frank is moving away, and both are cut off from friends and family.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the narrator in the wrong?\n\nFirst, let's consider the actions. The narrator suspected infidelity but didn't have proof. They made a comment to Frank (possibly jokingly) about a paternity test when they were drunk. Frank took that suggestion seriously and got the test, leading to the discovery of the affair and the child not being his. \n\nNow, was the narrator's comment a breach of privacy or a friend's duty? The narrator wasn't sure about the infidelity but had a \"feeling.\" They told Frank to get a paternity test. Even if they were drunk, the comment still had real consequences. However, if Annie actually was cheating, maybe the test was necessary. The issue here is whether the narrator overstepped by bringing up the paternity test. \n\nThe narrator's intention might have been to protect Frank from being taken advantage of financially and emotionally. But by making that suggestion, they might have acted without knowing the full story. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, the test revealed the truth. \n\nOn the other hand, the narrator is being blamed by their family for causing the breakdown of the marriage. The question is whether the narrator's actions were justified. If the narrator had no proof and just acted on a suspicion, that's one thing. But if they had a legitimate reason to suspect (like Annie's behavior), maybe they had a point. \n\nBut since the narrator was a close friend, maybe they had a right to be concerned. However, the way they approached it\u2014after drinking\u2014might have been inappropriate. Suggesting a paternity test is a serious matter and could be seen as crossing a boundary unless there's solid evidence. \n\nAdditionally, the narrator's family is criticizing them for not keeping quiet. The narrator's stance is that Annie was the one who created the situation, so they feel justified in their actions. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a gray area. If the narrator had no proof, maybe they shouldn't have said anything. But if they genuinely believed Annie was cheating and wanted to protect Frank, their action could be seen as trying to help. \n\nHowever, the key point is that the narrator's comment led to the paternity test, which exposed the cheating. The fact that Annie wasn't truthful might mean that the narrator's action was necessary. But the method (suggestion after drinking) was hasty. \n\nSo, is the narrator in the wrong? It's possible that they overstepped by bringing up the paternity test without more concrete evidence. However, if they had a justified suspicion based on Annie's behavior, maybe they were trying to help Frank. \n\nThe problem is that the narrator's comment was a direct suggestion that led to the test, which might have been the catalyst for the marriage's collapse. But if the marriage was already in trouble due to Annie's actions, then maybe the test was inevitable. \n\nIn conclusion, the narrator might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend. However, they could have handled it more discreetly or provided support without directly suggesting the test. The fact that they were drunk when they made the suggestion could also be a mitigating factor. Still, the impact of their words was significant, so there's some responsibility there. But considering the outcome (revealing the infidelity and protecting Frank), maybe the narrator's actions were justified despite the method. So, the answer might be B (No, the narrator is not in the wrong).\n"
