It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test that led to the discovery of Annie's infidelity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. Frank and Annie married, and Frank was away for work a lot. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. When the baby was announced, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously and found out he wasn't the father. The author is now being blamed by family for breaking up the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial stability and home.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation. \n\nLet's assess the key points. The author didn't accuse Annie directly but had a suspicion. They made a suggestion in a casual setting, but it was taken seriously by Frank. The author's intention might have been to help Frank ensure the child's paternity, especially after the marriage issues. However, the author was close to Annie and might have known her well enough to suspect something, even if not certain.\n\nThe problem here is whether the author overstepped by making such a suggestion. Since Frank ended up taking it and acting on it, the author's words led to the marriage's collapse. The author's family is blaming them for interfering, which is a common reaction when someone's personal life is disrupted. But from a moral standpoint, is the author wrong to want to ensure Frank wasn't being deceived? On the other hand, the author didn't have concrete evidence, and their suggestion might have been based on suspicion rather than fact. \n\nIn many relationships, if someone suspects infidelity, it's a personal matter between the couple. The author's role as a friend is to offer support, but suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as interfering. However, if the author had reasonable suspicion based on Annie's behavior, maybe they had a concern. The paternity test result confirmed the infidelity, which means the author's suspicion was right. But the method of bringing it up\u2014after drinking and in a casual conversation\u2014might not have been the best approach. \n\nSo, the author's intention was to help Frank, but the way it was handled caused unintended consequences. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their actions were justified. If the author had no evidence, then suggesting the test could be seen as meddling. However, if they had valid reasons to suspect, then it's a bit more complex. \n\nIn summary, while the author might not be the sole cause of the marriage breakdown, their suggestion played a role. Whether they are in the wrong could be debated. But given the information, the author's action was a result of suspicion, not malicious intent. However, in most cases, friends shouldn't be advising such actions without more concrete reasons. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's a case to be made that they overstepped. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they acted on suspicions to help Frank uncover the truth, which ultimately revealed the infidelity. However, the method might have been flawed. But since the result was the truth coming out, the author's intention was to help, so they aren't necessarily wrong.\n"
