I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong to support the husband, Frank, in getting a paternity test after suspecting infidelity from Annie. \n\nFirst, the user's relationship with Annie is close, almost like a sister. They've known each other since birth. Frank is in the oil industry with a work schedule that's 14 days on and off. During their three-year marriage, Annie never explicitly admitted to cheating, but the user had a feeling. Then when a baby was on the way, the user, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on it, and the test showed the child isn't his. The user's comment got blown out of proportion, leading to the marriage breaking down. Now, the user is being criticized by family and friends for ruining the marriage, and they feel Annie was the one who created the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the user's role in prompting the paternity test. The user didn't have direct evidence of cheating, just a feeling. Even though they were close to Annie, they still crossed a boundary by suggesting a test, which led to Frank taking action. The user's intention might have been to help Frank discover the truth, but the method was questionable because they weren't in a position to know for sure. \n\nAlso, considering the consequences: Annie is now without financial support and a home, and both the user and Frank are isolated. The user's family is upset because they think the user shouldn't have intervened. The user argues that Annie was at fault, but the user's action was the catalyst for the breakdown. \n\nIn ethical terms, even if the suspicion was valid, the user overstepped by making the suggestion without evidence. The user's role as a friend to both parties complicates things. While they might have believed they were helping Frank, they didn't have the right to push for a test without more concrete evidence. The emotional cheating aspect is also a factor\u2014Frank caught her in that, which might have contributed to the paternity issue. But the user's intervention was the direct cause of the marriage ending, so they might share some responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, the user could argue they were helping expose the truth. However, the way it was done\u2014without direct evidence and through a friend's suggestion\u2014could be seen as meddling. The user's family's criticism is about keeping out of others' business, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, the user's actions led to significant consequences, and while their intent might have been to help, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that they are in the wrong.\n"
