It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank, Annie, and the author, who is Annie's friend. \n\nFirst, let's recap the story. The author has known Annie since childhood, and Annie married Frank. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. The author suspected Annie was having an affair but didn't have proof. When they found out Annie was pregnant, the author jokingly suggested a paternity test after drinking. Frank took it seriously, got a test done, and it turned out the baby isn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is getting criticized for ruining the marriage. The author feels Annie was at fault and is standing by their suggestion.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's suggestion led to Frank discovering the infidelity, which ended the marriage. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that suggestion.\n\nI need to consider the moral implications. The author had suspicions but no proof. By suggesting a paternity test, they might have acted on their suspicions without certainty. However, the test revealed the baby wasn't Frank's, which means Annie was cheating. So, the author's action led to the truth coming out. \n\nBut was it the author's place to bring up the paternity test? The author wasn't directly involved in the marriage. They might have been overstepping, especially since they were Annie's friend. However, they weren't the one who cheated; Annie was. The author's intention was to confirm the truth, which ultimately exposed the infidelity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's comment, even if joking, might have been taken seriously and caused irreversible damage. Frank might have handled it differently if the author hadn't suggested the test. The author's friends and family are blaming them for ruining the marriage, but the root issue was Annie's infidelity. \n\nSo, the author isn't the one who cheated, but they might have played a role in exposing the infidelity. Whether they are in the wrong depends on whether their action was justified. Since they had a suspicion and wanted to confirm it, but as a friend, maybe they shouldn't have intervened. However, the main wrongdoer is Annie. \n\nThe answer might be B (No), because the author isn't at fault for pointing out the possible infidelity, especially since it turned out to be true. The real issue was Annie's actions, not the author's suggestion. But there's a chance the author overstepped, so maybe A (Yes). But I think the key is that the author's action led to the truth, which was necessary. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
