It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, and for suggesting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is close friends with Annie, who is married to Frank. The author's sister is Annie, but Annie has been more of a sister to them. Frank works in oil, with long periods away from home. Over three years of marriage, the author sensed Annie was cheating but couldn't act on it due to distance. When Annie got pregnant, the author, during a drunken conversation, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, the test revealed the child wasn't his, and Annie admitted to emotional cheating. Now, Annie is left without Frank's finances and home, moving back in with her parents. The author is being criticized for causing the marriage breakdown and is supporting Frank, leading to social isolation for both.\n\nThe key points here are the author's role in suggesting the paternity test and the consequences. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of advice, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as helping Frank uncover the truth about his paternity, especially if he was concerned. However, the author's timing and manner (after drinking) might be an issue. But if the marriage was already built on deceit, the test revealed the truth. \n\nAnnie's actions (cheating and not being honest) are clearly wrong. The author's intent was to help Frank confirm his suspicions. However, the author might have overstepped by suggesting it in a casual way, especially if they weren't certain. But given that Frank acted on it, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nThe author is criticized for causing the family issues, but Annie's infidelity led to the breakdown. The author's support for Frank could be justified as standing by someone who was wronged. However, the author's suggestion might have accelerated the situation. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author should have intervened. Since the author suspected something was wrong, stepping in might be seen as helping Frank. However, maybe the author should have advised Frank more directly instead of making a comment after drinking. The fact that the test revealed the child wasn't his suggests that the marriage was already in trouble. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their friend uncover the truth, which led to exposing the cheating. But there's a nuance in how they approached it. However, overall, supporting the wronged party (Frank) isn't the issue. The real problem is Annie's actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
