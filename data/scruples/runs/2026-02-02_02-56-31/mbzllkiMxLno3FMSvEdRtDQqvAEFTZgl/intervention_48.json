I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, by suggesting a paternity test after suspecting that the child might not be his. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The user is very close to Annie, like a sister, and has known her since childhood. Frank and Annie's marriage had issues for three years, but Annie never openly admitted to cheating. The user's comment about the paternity test, made after drinking, led Frank to actually get one, which confirmed his suspicions. Now, Annie is facing financial and housing instability, and the user is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage. The user feels Annie created the situation by cheating and thinks using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is at fault for bringing up the paternity test. The user's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth, right? But the way it was done\u2014after drinking and as a casual suggestion\u2014might have been a sensitive approach. However, the spouse's infidelity is typically considered the more significant issue here. The user isn't the one who committed the affair, so their role is more about pointing out a red flag they had sensed.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people might argue that the user overstepped by suggesting the test, especially if they were close to Annie. But others might say it was necessary for Frank to know the truth. The fact that the user was acting on a suspicion they had for a long time and felt the need to intervene when the marriage had a baby involved adds complexity. \n\nHowever, the user's family is upset because they think it's their fault. But the root cause is Annie's actions. The user didn't know for sure it was their friend's child, just had a feeling. Even if the comment was made in a social setting, the suggestion led to a test that confirmed the infidelity. The user is supporting Frank, who's the wronged party, which seems justified. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user should have approached it differently, like encouraging Frank to talk to Annie directly instead of suggesting a paternity test. That might have been a better method. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the user isn't the one who cheated. The blame here should fall more on Annie for the emotional and physical cheating. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the user is not in the wrong). They were trying to help Frank uncover the truth based on their observations. The real responsibility lies with Annie for her infidelity. The user's family's criticism is misplaced, as the user wasn't the one to cause the marital issues.\n"
