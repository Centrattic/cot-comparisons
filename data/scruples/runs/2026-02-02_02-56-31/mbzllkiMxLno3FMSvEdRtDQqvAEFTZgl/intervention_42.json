  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The situation involves their friend Annie who they've known since childhood, and Annie's husband Frank.\n\nFirst, the user noticed that Annie might have been unfaithful but couldn't act on it from afar. Then, during a visit, the user suggested a paternity test to Frank after some drinking. That led to Frank getting the test, which confirmed the child wasn't his. Now, the user is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage. The user feels Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. They're sticking to their stance but are isolated now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is wrong. Let me break it down. The user's intention wasn't to cheat but to help Frank verify paternity. However, they might have overstepped by suggesting the test, especially after drinking. But Frank took the suggestion seriously, leading to the revelation. \n\nAnnie's actions (cheating and emotional infidelity) led to the breakdown. The user's role was facilitating the test, which exposed the truth. The user isn't the one who cheated, so they aren't directly at fault. However, maybe they should have approached it differently or not brought it up at all. But given the circumstances, they had a suspicion and tried to help a close friend. \n\nThe user's family thinks they should have stayed silent. But Annie's actions were the root cause. The user's intent was to help Frank, who was being cheated on. The child's parentage isn't the user's fault. So overall, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
