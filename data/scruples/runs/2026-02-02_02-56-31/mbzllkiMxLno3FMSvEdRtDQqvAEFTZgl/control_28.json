It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-in-law Annie who had an affair, and the author suggested a paternity test to the husband Frank, which eventually led to the discovery that Frank wasn't the biological father of the child. Now, the author is getting criticized by family for causing the marriage to break down and causing Annie and the child to suffer. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has known Annie since childhood, they're close as siblings. Frank was working in a job that kept him away for weeks at a time. The author sensed something was off with Annie's marriage but couldn't act on it from afar. Then, when they found out about the pregnancy, the author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test to Frank. That suggestion led to the test which confirmed the child wasn't his. Now, Annie is without the income from Frank and has to move back home. The author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage and not considering the child's well-being. The author feels that Annie was the one who created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's suggestion of the paternity test was wrong. Let's break it down. The author had a suspicion that Annie might be cheating, but it was just a feeling. Then, during a conversation where they were both drunk, the author suggested the test. Frank took the suggestion seriously and followed through, which led to the divorce and the current situation.\n\nEthically, did the author overstep? Well, the author wasn't in a position to know for sure that Annie was cheating. They had a feeling, but no proof. By suggesting a paternity test, they might have planted a seed of doubt in Frank's mind. Even though Frank later insisted on the test, the author's comment was the catalyst. The problem is that the author, without concrete evidence, encouraged an action that could lead to a family breakdown. \n\nOn the other hand, Frank was already suspicious and had \"caught her emotional cheating,\" according to the story. So maybe Frank was already considering the possibility. The author's suggestion might have pushed him to take action he was already leaning towards. But still, the author's role in initiating that action is in question.\n\nAnother angle: The author's relationship with Annie is close, but they were not in a position to intervene directly. The suggestion of a paternity test is a sensitive action that can have serious consequences. Even if the author's intention was to help Frank discover the truth, the method might have been inappropriate. They might not have had the right to involve themselves in such a personal matter without being directly asked by Frank. \n\nThe author's family is criticizing them for not keeping their mouth shut, which makes sense because their intervention caused a chain of events leading to the marriage's end. However, the author argues that Annie was the one at fault and that the child card is being misused. There's a moral dilemma here between supporting truth and the potential harm it causes. \n\nIn some perspectives, uncovering infidelity and the resulting consequences are necessary for Frank's well-being and for the child's future if the parentage is important. But the way the author approached it\u2014without being asked and in a social setting\u2014could be seen as crossing boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether their actions were justified. If Frank was already considering the possibility and the author's suggestion was the push he needed, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But if the author had no right to intervene and caused harm without being asked, then they might be in the wrong. \n\nThe key here is that the author didn't have proof and acted on their suspicion. Even though they believed they were helping, they might have overstepped. So, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (Answer A). But there's also a counter-argument that they were trying to do the right thing. However, given the consequences and the fact that they weren't part of the marriage, their intervention was probably not appropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
