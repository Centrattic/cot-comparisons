  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation involves their friend Annie, who had an affair and had a child that's not Frank's. The user suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery, and now they're getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. Frank's job keeps him away for two weeks at a time. The user noticed something off but couldn't act due to distance. When they visited, they jokingly suggested a paternity test after drinking, which Frank took seriously. The test revealed the child isn't his, and Annie was emotionally cheating. Now Frank is isolated, moving away, and the user is blamed by family.\n\nThe user is being accused of ruining the marriage and not considering the child. They feel Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. The user supports Frank despite the fallout.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's consider the facts. The user's suggestion led to the paternity test, which exposed the infidelity. But was the suggestion justified? The user had a feeling but no proof. They might have acted out of concern, but without evidence, it's possible they overstepped. However, Annie's actions were wrong regardless. The user's family is upset because they see the user as the cause of the breakup, but the root cause is Annie's infidelity. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user might have acted recklessly by bringing up the test, especially in a joking manner. However, the main wrongdoer is Annie. The user's intent was to help, even if it backfired. The question is whether the user had the right to intervene. Since they weren't directly involved in the marriage, maybe they should have stayed out. But given the close relationship, they might have thought they were helping.\n\nAlso, the user's family is upset, but the user believes Annie is at fault. The dilemma is whether the user's actions, though well-intentioned, caused unnecessary harm. However, the real issue is Annie's cheating. The user's action might have been a catalyst but not the root cause. So, the user isn't entirely at fault. They might not be in the wrong because the main issue is Annie's actions, not the user's suggestion. However, they could have handled it differently, perhaps by confronting Annie first or not bringing it up in front of Frank. But given the situation, the user's intent was to help Frank, so maybe they aren't wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong (B) because the primary fault lies with Annie. The user acted on a suspicion, and while the method might have been questionable, the intent was to uncover the truth. The real responsibility is Annie's for the infidelity and deception.\n"
