It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a close friend, Annie, who's married to Frank. The author has a sisterly bond with Annie. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years, the author felt something was off but didn't confront Annie directly. Then, a baby is on the way, and the author, after some drinks, suggests a paternity test to Frank. That led to the discovery that the baby isn't his, and now Annie is left without Frank's income and home. The author is being criticized for ruining the marriage, and they're both isolated. The author stands by their actions, thinking Annie created the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's role here is as a close friend. They had suspicions about Annie cheating but weren't sure. They made a comment under the influence, which Frank took seriously. The key points are: the author's intention was to ensure the child was Frank's, based on their suspicions. But Annie had been emotionally cheating. The author is now blamed for causing the breakup.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, maybe they overstepped by suggesting the test, but they had a close relationship with Annie and were concerned. On the other hand, they didn't know for sure if Annie was cheating. They acted on a feeling, which is risky. But if the other person was being unfaithful, maybe the author was trying to protect Frank. However, the method of confronting it through a suggestion after drinking might not have been the best approach. But considering they were close, maybe they felt justified. The question is whether the author is at fault. Since they acted on their suspicions without concrete evidence, but Annie was indeed cheating, it's a bit of a grey area. The author's intention was to help, but the method might have been flawed. However, since the situation ended up revealing the truth, maybe they're not wrong. Alternatively, maybe they should have kept quiet, as the consequences were severe. The fact that Annie is now in a tough spot, but she was the one who cheated. The author's support for Frank might be seen as right because they were trying to help him uncover the truth. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
