  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation involves a friend's sister, Annie, who cheated on Frank, and the user suggested a paternity test after suspecting something.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to help Frank, right? They noticed something off and, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. The key here is whether the user had a valid reason to suspect infidelity. The story says Annie never openly admitted cheating, but the user felt a \"feeling.\" That's a bit vague. Did the user have concrete evidence or just a hunch?\n\nThen, when Frank acted on the suggestion and found out the baby wasn't his, the user's name was brought up. Now, the user is getting blamed by their own family for ruining the marriage. The user argues that Annie was the one who created the situation, not them. But the user's role was in initiating the test that exposed the cheating.\n\nLegally, in most places, suggesting a paternity test isn't illegal. Ethically, though, it's a gray area. The user might have overstepped by making the suggestion without concrete proof. However, if they genuinely believed there was an issue and Frank chose to act, the responsibility shifts to Frank's decision. The user's family is blaming them, but maybe they don't realize the user's role was minimal once the suggestion was made.\n\nAlso, the user is isolated now. The question is about whether they're in the wrong. If the user had no malicious intent and just wanted to help a friend, then maybe not. But if they acted without evidence and caused unnecessary harm, maybe they are. However, since the cheating actually happened, the user's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which might be the right thing in the long run.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer hinges on intent and evidence. Since the user acted on a suspicion and Frank chose to follow through, the user isn't necessarily wrong. The blame should be on Annie for cheating, not the user for trying to help. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
