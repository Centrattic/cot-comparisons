  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user has been friends with Annie since childhood. When Frank and Annie got married, the user noticed something off but couldn't act on it because of the distance. Then, when Annie got pregnant, the user, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, got tested, and found out the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the user is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user didn't know for sure about the cheating but had a feeling. They made a comment that led Frank to get a test. The user's family is upset because they think the user shouldn't have said anything, and now they're both ostracized.\n\nI need to determine if the user is wrong. Well, the user didn't have concrete evidence but still mentioned the test. That could be seen as meddling. On the other hand, Annie was emotionally cheating and had a child with someone else, which is definitely wrong. The user might have been trying to protect Frank, but maybe they overstepped. However, the user didn't force Frank to do the test, he made the choice himself after the comment. The user's family is being harsh by blaming them for the outcome. So, maybe the user isn't entirely wrong because they were trying to help a friend, but they could have been more cautious. But since the user didn't have proof, suggesting it without being certain might have been a mistake. However, since Frank decided to act on it, the responsibility isn't fully on the user. The main wrongdoer here is Annie. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
