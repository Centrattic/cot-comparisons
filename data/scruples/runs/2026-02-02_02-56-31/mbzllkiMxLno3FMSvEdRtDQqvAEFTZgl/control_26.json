It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's best friend Annie married Frank. Frank was away a lot for work. The author had a suspicion that Annie was cheating and didn't say anything directly for a year. Then, during a visit, the author mentioned the idea of a paternity test to Frank after drinking. Frank later made them get a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. The author is now being criticized by family for causing the marriage breakdown, with people saying they should've stayed silent and considering the child. The author feels Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author do something wrong by suggesting a paternity test? Well, the author had concerns but didn't have proof. They brought it up in a casual way, possibly as a joke, but it ended up leading to the test. However, the user is asking if the author is at fault. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then Annie is the one who broke the marriage. The author's intention was to help Frank ensure the child was his. But the method of bringing it up might have been awkward, especially after drinking. However, the author wasn't directly accusing Annie; they were just suggesting a test. The problem is that the author didn't have concrete evidence and their comment led to the breakup. \n\nBut is the author to blame? Maybe not. Because the author had a concern and tried to advise Frank. Even if the way it was brought up was off, the underlying issue was Annie's infidelity. The author's actions were a catalyst, but the root cause was Annie's actions. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The family might be blaming the author as a way to avoid confronting Annie's wrongdoing. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author shouldn't have meddled and should have kept their mouth shut, not knowing for sure. But considering the outcome, the author was trying to protect Frank's interest in paternity, which is a valid concern. So, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong), because the author's intent was to help and the fault lies with Annie for cheating.\n"
