It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage, where Frank found out the baby isn't his after the author suggested a paternity test. The author's friends and family are upset with them for ruining the marriage, and the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Annie was emotionally cheating. The key point here is that the author didn't know for sure but had a feeling. They suggested a paternity test after some drinking, which Frank later took. The test revealed the baby wasn't his. The author's intention was to help Frank be sure, but it led to the marriage breakdown.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author didn't have direct evidence of infidelity, just a suspicion. However, bringing up paternity tests can be a sensitive topic. Even if the author thought they were helping, suggesting something that could break up a marriage without concrete proof might be seen as crossing a line. But on the other hand, if the author had a legitimate concern based on knowing Annie for a long time, maybe they felt compelled to speak up.\n\nThe author's family is criticizing them for speaking out, but the author believes Annie was the one creating the situation. The question is whether the author's action was justified. In some perspectives, the author might have overstepped by not having enough proof, but in others, they were trying to help a friend see the truth.\n\nI think the answer depends on the context. If the author had no evidence, they might be partly at fault for causing a rift without certainty. But if they genuinely believed there was a chance of infidelity, maybe it's a gray area. However, in most cases, suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as meddling, so the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle is that Frank and Annie were already in a troubled marriage, and the author's suggestion was the catalyst, so the author's role is questionable. The emotional cheating part is mentioned, but did the author know about that before suggesting the test? The story says Frank let it slip he caught her emotionally cheating, so maybe the author didn't know all the details. Hmm. If the author didn't know about the emotional cheating, their suggestion might have been based on a hunch. Still, it's possible the author is overstepping. I'm leaning towards A for the answer.\n"
