I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they have a sister figure named Annie, who married Frank. The person (let's call them the narrator) knew Annie since childhood and always considered her a sister. Frank works in oil with a 14-day on-off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie had a baby, but the narrator suspected something and, during a visit, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, found out the baby wasn't his, and now Annie is left without Frank's income and home. The narrator is getting criticized by their family for causing the marriage to fall apart and are being told to consider the child. The question is whether the narrator is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The narrator had suspicions about Annie's fidelity but didn't have direct evidence. They suggested a paternity test to Frank after drinking, which he later acted on. The result confirmed his fears, leading to the divorce. Now, the narrator is being blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nFrom the narrator's perspective, they might feel they were protecting Frank from being cheated on and from being a biological father to a child that isn't his. They might believe Annie was the one at fault for cheating and not being honest. However, the question is whether the narrator made the right move.\n\nOne angle is that the narrator had a suspicion but didn't have proof. By suggesting a paternity test, even in a casual setting, they might have been acting on their intuition to protect a friend's marriage. But did they overstep? The narrator wasn't in a position to confront Annie directly, so they went to Frank. That could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship without being in a position to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and not being honest, the narrator's suggestion might have been the catalyst for Frank to take action. But does that make the narrator right? Or did they cause unnecessary harm without knowing the full story?\n\nAnother point is the emotional impact. The marriage broke down, and the narrator is now being blamed. The narrator might feel they were helping, but others see them as the cause. There's also the child involved, which complicates things. Even if Annie cheated, the child is innocent. The narrator's actions might have led to Frank cutting off support, affecting the child's life.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The narrator might have acted out of concern for Frank, but without direct evidence, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as meddling. However, if their suspicions were correct, they might have prevented Frank from being deceived for longer. The key is whether the narrator had the right to intervene in that way.\n\nIn terms of relationships, friends might have a duty to speak up if they suspect something serious, like infidelity. But the method here was to suggest a paternity test without confronting Annie first. That might have been a mistake. The narrator's family is criticizing them for breaking up the marriage, which could be valid if the narrator didn't have solid evidence. However, if Annie was indeed unfaithful, then the narrator might be justified in trying to help Frank.\n\nThe question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. If they acted out of genuine concern and their suspicions were right, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they acted without proof and caused unnecessary harm, then they might be. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some views, intervening to protect a friend is noble, while in others, it's meddling.\n\nBut considering the situation, the narrator didn't have proof, just a feeling. Acting on that could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the outcome was correct (the baby wasn't Frank's), the way it was handled might have been inappropriate. The narrator's suggestion led to the divorce, which caused a lot of upheaval. So maybe they are in the wrong for not being sure before acting. Alternatively, they might be in the right if they were trying to prevent a bigger deception.\n\nI think the key here is the lack of direct evidence. The narrator's suspicion was based on a feeling, not facts. Suggesting a paternity test without talking to Annie first might have been a mistake. However, if they had confronted Annie and she denied it, then Frank might never have known. But the narrator didn't do that. So, their actions might have been hasty. Therefore, they could be in the wrong for not ensuring the situation was clear before acting.\n"
