I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband in their story. \n\nFirst, the situation: Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The narrator (let's call them Alex) suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't do much because they live far away. When a baby was on the way, Alex suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery that he wasn't the father. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and support, moving back home. Alex is getting criticism from family for \"ruining\" the marriage and causing the separation.\n\nSo, the main question is whether Alex did something wrong by suggesting the paternity test. \n\nLet's consider the key points. Cheating (emotional cheating in this case) is a major betrayal in a marriage. Annie created a situation where Frank was unaware he wasn't the biological father. Alex, as a close friend, noticed something was off and decided to bring up the paternity test. Even though it was after drinking, the suggestion led to Frank taking action. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting someone who's been cheated on might be seen as justified. However, the way Alex approached it could be problematic. Suggesting a paternity test isn't a minor thing. It's possible that Alex overstepped by bringing it up without concrete evidence. But on the other hand, if Annie had been emotionally cheating and manipulating Frank, maybe Alex's intervention was necessary.\n\nThe criticism from family is that Alex shouldn't have said anything, but if they believe Annie is at fault, then Alex's role might be seen as helping the wronged party. However, the child aspect complicates things. People are using the child to argue against Alex, but the issue is that if the child isn't Frank's, his responsibility isn't the same. Also, Annie's part-time job might mean she can support the child, but maybe not as easily as with Frank's income.\n\nAnother angle: emotional cheating isn't physical, but it can still be damaging. If Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe Frank's trust was broken, leading to the paternity issue. Alex's role was to point out the possibility, which Frank acted on. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, Alex might not be entirely at fault because the root cause was Annie's actions. But the method of suggesting the test might have been hasty. However, given that the marriage was already strained due to Frank's absence, Annie's infidelity, and the deception about the child, the outcome might be seen as a consequence of Annie's choices.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Alex might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank uncover the truth that he might not have otherwise. However, the way they approached it could be questioned. But given the context, supporting Frank in this situation is understandable. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
