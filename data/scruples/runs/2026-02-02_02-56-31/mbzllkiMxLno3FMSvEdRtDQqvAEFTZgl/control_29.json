It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Frank and Annie. The author is friends with them both and feels like a sister to Annie. Frank was cheating, but it's actually Annie who was cheating? Wait, no, wait. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe story says Frank works in oil industry with a 14 days on and off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly said she was seeing someone, but the author had a feeling. Then when the baby was coming, the author suggested during drinking that Frank might consider a paternity test. That led Frank to push for a test, which revealed the kid wasn't his. Also, Annie was emotionally cheating. Now Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The author is getting blamed by family for breaking up the marriage. The author thinks Annie caused the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. The author is sticking to her belief, even though both she and Frank are isolated now.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's action was suggesting a paternity test. But how did they know to suggest it? The author had a feeling Annie was cheating. The author says Annie never directly admitted infidelity, but the author had suspicions. The author's suggestion led Frank to get the test, which proved the child wasn't his. Now the marriage is over, and the author is being blamed.\n\nIs the author responsible for the fallout? Well, the author was acting on suspicions. The author might have thought that Frank should know the truth, even if it caused marital issues. But maybe the author overstepped by suggesting the test. Did they have any right to intervene? The author is close to both, but is it their place to push for a paternity test? If the author didn't have evidence, just a feeling, and then pushed Frank to take action, maybe the author is at fault. Alternatively, maybe the author is not to blame because Annie was cheating, and the truth needed to come out. But the author's role in bringing that up directly might have been the catalyst.\n\nAlso, considering that Annie was the one who was cheating, but the author is being blamed by their family. The author might be in a position where they thought they were helping Frank discover the truth. However, the method of suggesting a paternity test after drinking might not have been the right approach. But the real issue is whether the author is in the wrong. If Frank was already considering a test, or Annie's cheating was evident, maybe the author was right to push for the truth. On the other hand, if the author didn't have concrete reasons, just a feeling, maybe they shouldn't have intervened. But the story says the author's feeling was correct, as the child wasn't Frank's. So maybe the author was justified in wanting the truth to come out. However, the way it was done\u2014suggesting a paternity test\u2014might have been the trigger, which led to the breakup. So the author is blamed for ruining the marriage, but the real issue was Annie's infidelity. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to uncover a betrayal. But maybe they shouldn't have meddled. It's a bit tricky. In terms of responsibility, if the author acted with good intentions but caused unintended consequences, maybe they are not entirely at fault. On the other hand, if they acted without full knowledge, maybe they are. But since Annie was cheating, maybe the author did the right thing. So the answer could be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
