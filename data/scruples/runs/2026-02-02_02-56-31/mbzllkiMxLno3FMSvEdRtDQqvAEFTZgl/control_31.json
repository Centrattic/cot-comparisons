It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank discovering the infidelity. Now the author is being criticized by family for causing the breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author, let's call them \"Me,\" is a close friend of Annie. Me felt something was off during Frank's 14-day work schedule and eventually suggested a paternity test. The test revealed the child wasn't Frank's. Now, Frank is isolated, Annie is without income and a home, and Me is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. The question is whether Me is in the wrong.\n\nAnnie had been married to Frank for 3 years, and during that time, she was seeing someone else. The author didn't have direct evidence but sensed it. The key here is that Me's comment about the paternity test was made after drinking, but it was taken seriously by Frank. The test confirmed the affair. The family is blaming Me for not keeping quiet and causing the marriage to end.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone is in a cheating relationship, the person being cheated on has the right to know. But Me isn't the one who cheated; they're a friend. However, Me's suggestion led to the discovery. The question is whether Me overstepped by pushing Frank to take the test. \n\nBut wait, Me wasn't sure. They had a feeling, but no proof. By suggesting the test, Me might have acted on a suspicion without being certain. However, in cases like these, the person wronged (Frank) has the right to seek clarity, even if the suspicion is just a feeling. The problem is that Me's advice led to a breakup, and now they're being blamed for it. \n\nIs it Me's responsibility to keep quiet? If the family thinks Me should have stayed out of it, maybe they are right. But if Annie was actually cheating, then Frank deserves to know. The author is in a tricky spot because they're a friend to both. \n\nThe family is using the child as a card, which is unfair. Annie left Frank with no income, so it's her responsibility as the parent. The author's support to Frank might be justified, but the means of how they found out (through Me's suggestion) is complicating things. \n\nIn terms of ethics, Me isn't at fault for trying to help a friend. However, they might have acted without knowing the full story. But given that the test confirmed the affair, maybe Me's action was necessary. The family's blame is misplaced because Annie was the one who committed the infidelity. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author's suspicion led to the truth, and while their method might have been questionable, the outcome was that Frank knew the truth. The real fault lies with Annie for cheating, not the author for trying to help.\n"
