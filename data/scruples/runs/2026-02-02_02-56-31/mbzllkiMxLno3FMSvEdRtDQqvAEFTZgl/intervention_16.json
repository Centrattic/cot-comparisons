  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, and suggesting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the situation: Frank and Annie were married for three years. Frank works in oil with a 14-on, 14-off schedule. Annie was cheating emotionally and had a child who isn't Frank's. The user, who's close to Annie since childhood, had a feeling something was wrong and during a visit after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously and got the test. Now the marriage is over, and the user is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage. They're defending their actions, saying Annie was at fault.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user did something wrong. \n\nLet me break it down. The user didn't have direct evidence but had a feeling. They suggested a test in a casual context (after beers), which led to the discovery. But the user wasn't the one who cheated; Annie was. The user's role was to express suspicion, which Frank acted on. \n\nBut the user is being criticized by family for interfering. Is their suggestion a betrayal of Annie? Well, Annie had a history of emotional cheating, and the user was concerned for Frank. Even though the user is close to Annie, they were trying to protect Frank, who was being cheated on. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone is being cheated on, supporting them in seeking the truth isn't wrong. However, the method of bringing up the suggestion in a casual setting might have been inappropriate. But the user had no malicious intent, just concern based on their observations. \n\nAnnie's actions were the root cause of the problem. The user's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which ended the marriage. But the user didn't force Frank to take action; he made that choice. So the user isn't directly responsible for the marriage's end. \n\nThe family is blaming the user, but the user is standing by their actions because they believe Annie was the one at fault. The user's concern for Frank's well-being and the child's paternity is valid. The user might have overstepped by suggesting the test without more concrete evidence, but given the circumstances, it's hard to say they're entirely wrong. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the user isn't in the wrong. They were trying to help Frank uncover the truth, which was ultimately the right thing to do, even if it led to a painful outcome. The blame should be on Annie for her infidelity and the deceit, not the user for bringing it up.\n"
