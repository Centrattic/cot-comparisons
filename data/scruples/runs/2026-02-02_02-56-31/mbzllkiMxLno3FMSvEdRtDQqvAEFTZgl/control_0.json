It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's close friend, Annie, who married Frank. The author feels that Annie was cheating, and when Frank found out about the paternity test suggestion, it led to the dissolution of their marriage. Now, the author is being criticized by their family for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author suspected Annie of infidelity and suggested a paternity test to Frank, which ultimately led to the discovery that the child wasn't his. The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have meddled. The author defends their actions by saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as a reason is unfair.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the author's role here is a bit complex. On one hand, they had a close relationship with Annie and Frank, and they noticed something was off. But Annie never directly confessed to cheating; it was just a suspicion. The author made a suggestion that, while it led to the truth coming out, also caused significant harm to both parties.\n\nBut was the author justified in making that suggestion? If the author had concrete evidence, maybe. However, they only had a feeling. Intervening in someone's marriage without direct proof can be tricky. The author might have thought they were helping Frank, but their actions could also be seen as overstepping. However, the outcome was that the cheating was exposed, which might mean the author did the right thing in the long run.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's family is upset because they believe the author shouldn't have interfered. The author's motivation was to protect their sisterly friend, but the method might have been problematic. The question is whether the author is responsible for the consequences of their suggestion. Since they didn't have proof and relied on a hunch, maybe they did act recklessly.\n\nBut in a situation where a spouse is cheating, even if the other party is in denial, sometimes it takes an outside person to point it out. The author might not be entirely at fault because they were trying to uncover the truth. However, the way they approached it could have been better. Maybe they should have talked to Frank privately first or gathered more evidence before suggesting the test.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were based on suspicion without proof, but their intention was to help Frank. The consequences were severe, but the cheating was real. So, while the author might not be in the wrong, they could have handled it more carefully. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were justified despite the lack of proof. The community might weigh in on whether the author's intervention was necessary or if they overstepped. However, since the outcome was exposing the infidelity, the author might not be the asshole here. But the fact that they acted without direct evidence could make them partially responsible.\n"
