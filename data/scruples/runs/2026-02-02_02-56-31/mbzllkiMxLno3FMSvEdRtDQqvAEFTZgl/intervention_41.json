  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend, Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank. The person in question is the narrator, who has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. The narrator found out that Annie was cheating and possibly had a child not Frank's. The narrator suggested a paternity test, which led to the revelation and the breakdown of the marriage. Now, the narrator is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage and causing problems. They're supporting Frank, who is moving away, and are being criticized for not keeping quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The narrator's intention in suggesting the paternity test was likely to help Frank discover the truth, as they had a feeling something was wrong. But the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong for bringing it up. \n\nOn one hand, the narrator might have acted out of concern for Frank, thinking that Annie was cheating. If the narrator had solid evidence or a strong reason to believe something was off, maybe it's justified. However, they didn't have direct evidence, just a feeling. Intervening in someone's marriage without proof can be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, Annie was the one who cheated, so she's clearly at fault. The narrator's suggestion led to Frank getting the truth, which, while painful, might be the right thing in the long run. But the narrator didn't have the right to push for a paternity test unless they had Frank's consent or clear evidence. The fact that they mentioned it after drinking might have made it easier for Frank to act on it later, but does that make the narrator responsible?\n\nThe family is criticizing the narrator for causing the breakup. But if Annie was cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then the marriage was already in trouble. The narrator's role was perhaps to bring up the suspicion, but they might have overstepped by suggesting a paternity test without more concrete proof. \n\nAlso, the narrator is now being isolated and blamed. However, supporting a wronged husband in a cheating situation might be seen as justified. The main issue is whether the narrator had the right to interfere. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to voice their concerns if they suspect infidelity, but they shouldn't act on baseless accusations. The narrator's intuition led them to suggest the test, but without direct evidence, it's a gray area. The outcome was negative, but the root cause was Annie's actions. \n\nSo, considering all this, the narrator might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank discover the truth. However, they might have acted without sufficient evidence, which could be seen as meddling. The responsibility mainly lies with Annie for the cheating, but the narrator's role in exposing it is debatable.\n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the narrator acted on a suspicion and the real fault lies with Annie. However, the method of bringing it up might have been a bit hasty. But overall, supporting the truth in a cheating scenario is understandable.\n"
