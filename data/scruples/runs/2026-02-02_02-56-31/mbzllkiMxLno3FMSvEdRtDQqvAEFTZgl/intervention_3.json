  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test which led to the discovery that the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the user and Frank had a close relationship. The user noticed signs that Annie might be cheating and, after some alcohol, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on getting one, which revealed the child isn't his. Now, the user is being criticized by family for causing the breakdown of the marriage. They feel Annie created the situation, and they think using the child as an excuse is unfair. Both the user and Frank are isolated now, and Frank is moving away.\n\nSo, the key points are: the user's concern was based on a feeling, they suggested a test, which led to the truth. The user's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. The user believes Annie was at fault, not them.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user acted on suspicion, which is understandable if they had reasons to believe something was wrong. However, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as intrusive. But since Frank ended up confirming the infidelity, maybe he needed to know. The user's intention was to help Frank, which is commendable. However, bringing up the test in a casual way after drinking might have been inappropriate. The aftermath led to family tension, but the user's actions were based on concern for their friend. It's a tough spot. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the cultural and personal values of the people involved. The user didn't cheat themselves, just tried to uncover the truth. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
