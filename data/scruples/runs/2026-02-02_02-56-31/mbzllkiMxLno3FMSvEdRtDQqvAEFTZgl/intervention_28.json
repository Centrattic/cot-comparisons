  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were wrong to support the husband who was cheated on. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie had an affair, and the husband found out through a paternity test suggested by the user. Now the user is getting blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The user wasn't directly involved in the cheating but made a suggestion that led to the discovery. The main question is whether the user is at fault here. Supporting Frank in this scenario might be seen as standing up for the wronged party, but the user's role was just making a comment that led to the test. However, the user's family is blaming them for not staying silent. \n\nAnnie is now in a difficult position, losing her home and income. The user's actions, even if well-intentioned, might have contributed to the breakdown. But wasn't Annie the one who cheated? The user's suggestion might have been the catalyst, but the root cause was Annie's infidelity. \n\nThe user's family is saying the user should have kept quiet. But if the user believed there was a possibility of the baby not being Frank's, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as helping Frank uncover the truth. However, the user might not have known the extent of the consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't have evidence, just a feeling. Making such a suggestion after drinking might have been impulsive. But Frank chose to act on it, leading to the situation. The user's role might be minimal compared to Annie's actions. \n\nSo, is the user at fault? It's a gray area. The user didn't force Frank to take the test, but their suggestion led to the discovery. However, Annie's actions were the main problem. The user might not be entirely at fault, but they did play a role in the outcome. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives and the expectation of keeping out of others' business. But since Annie was the one who cheated, the user's support for Frank could be justified. The user's mistake might be in how they approached it, not the act of supporting Frank itself.\n"
