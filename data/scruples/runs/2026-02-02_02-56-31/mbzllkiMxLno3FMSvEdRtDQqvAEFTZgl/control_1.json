It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test that led to the discovery of infidelity and a child not being Frank's. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is close friends with Annie, who married Frank. Frank was away working a lot, and the author suspected Annie was cheating. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out the child wasn't his. Now the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage and is isolated, while defending their position that Annie was at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author overstep by suggesting the paternity test? Was there enough evidence to justify that suggestion? The author mentions having a feeling but not concrete proof. Annie didn't openly admit to cheating. The author's suggestion triggered actions that led to the breakup, which caused consequences like Annie being without income and moving back in with her parents. The author is now being blamed by family for ruining a \"good marriage.\"\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. If someone suspects infidelity, what's the appropriate action? Suggesting a paternity test could be seen as a way to get the truth, but it's a sensitive issue. The author might have acted out of concern for Frank, but without direct evidence, the suggestion might have been premature. However, Frank did later take the step to get the test, which Annie didn't pass. \n\nThe author's role is as a friend, trying to help. However, inserting oneself into a marital issue can be problematic. The author's intent was to help Frank uncover the truth, but the method and timing might be questioned. The fact that the author was drunk when making the comment might not absolve them of responsibility, as the suggestion still had real consequences.\n\nAnnie's actions (cheating and having a child with someone else) are clearly unethical, but the author's role in exposing it is complicated. The author is now facing backlash for \"ruining the marriage,\" but the marriage was based on a lie. The author's support of Frank in the aftermath could be justified as standing up against deceit.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author was wrong. Legally and ethically, if the author had no right to interfere, but as a friend, they might have acted out of concern. The answer hinges on whether the author overstepped. Since the author didn't have proof, just a suspicion, and their suggestion led to the breakup, some might argue it's the author's fault. Others might say the real fault lies with Annie for cheating.\n\nIn terms of social norms, intervening in a friend's relationship is tricky. The author might be seen as overstepping if they didn't have sufficient reason. But given that the marriage was built on a lie, the author's actions could be seen as necessary. However, the author's role as a third party in someone else's marriage complicates things.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because Annie was the one who cheated, and the author helped Frank uncover the truth. The consequences are unfortunate, but the author was protecting their friend from ongoing deceit. However, there's a counterargument that the author shouldn't have meddled without being asked. But given the context, supporting the honest party might not be the author's fault.\n"
