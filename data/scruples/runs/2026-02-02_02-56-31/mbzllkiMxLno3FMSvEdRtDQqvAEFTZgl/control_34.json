It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister-in-law, Annie, who had an affair and had a child that isn't their husband Frank's. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery and the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The author has a close relationship with Annie, more like a sister. Frank was in a marriage where Annie was cheating, but he didn't know. The author suspects this for years but doesn't confront Annie directly. Instead, during a visit where they're both drunk, the author suggests a paternity test. Frank takes it seriously, gets the test done, and finds out the baby isn't his. The fallout is that Annie is now financially dependent, and the author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe author's stance is that Annie created the situation by cheating, and they're standing by their suggestion of the paternity test. The family is upset with the author, saying they should have stayed silent. The author feels Annie is at fault, not them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Did the author have the right to suggest the paternity test? Well, the author was concerned about the baby not being Frank's, possibly due to observing Annie's behavior over time. But the author didn't have direct evidence. Suggesting a paternity test might have been a way to get clarity, but it's a sensitive topic. The timing and the fact that they were drunk could be factors. Also, the author's suggestion led Frank to take action, which resulted in the marriage ending.\n\nBut was the author overstepping? Since the author is close to both, they might have felt it was their duty to protect Frank. However, intervening in someone else's marriage can be tricky. The author didn't confront Annie directly but instead talked to Frank. That might be seen as meddling, especially if the author didn't have concrete proof. The fact that Annie was cheating on Frank, and the author suspected it, could justify trying to help Frank. However, the method of bringing it up during a drunk conversation might have been irresponsible.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for suggesting the test is important. If the author was genuinely concerned for Frank's well-being and the child's paternity, maybe they had good intentions. But if the author was acting out of their own suspicions without evidence, that's different. The aftermath shows that Frank was emotionally affected, and the author is being blamed by family for causing the breakup.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's actions led to the exposure of the infidelity and the end of the marriage. While Annie is clearly at fault for cheating, the author's role is more complex. They might have thought they were helping Frank, but their actions had significant consequences. However, without the test, Frank might have continued to financially support a child that isn't his, which could be seen as unfair in the long run.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth. While the method could have been better (like confronting Annie first or finding a more appropriate time), the action itself might be justified. Since the marriage was already built on lies, the test revealed the truth. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a close call. The answer might be B (No), because the author was trying to expose the infidelity, which Annie caused. The family's blame is misplaced, as Annie's actions led to the situation, not the author's suggestion.\n"
