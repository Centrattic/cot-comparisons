It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage, where Annie was emotionally cheating, and the author suggested a paternity test. The key points to consider here are the author's role in the situation and whether their actions were justified.\n\nFirst, the author has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sister. They suspected infidelity but couldn't do much from afar. When the couple announced a pregnancy, the author, after drinking, mentioned the paternity test idea during a visit. Frank took this seriously and insisted on the test, which confirmed the child wasn't his. Now, the author is facing backlash from family for \"ruining the marriage\" and being blamed for the fallout.\n\nThe author's main defense is that Annie was the one who created the situation, and using the child as an excuse is unfair. They believe they were right to speak up because of the emotional cheating. The question is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have overstepped by bringing up the paternity test, especially if they weren't certain. However, they had a long-standing suspicion and were close to the couple. The emotional cheating was real, and the author was trying to prevent Frank from being deceived further. The fact that the test revealed the child wasn't Frank's shows that the author's concern was valid. The author isn't the one who committed the infidelity; Annie did. The author's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth, even if it led to a difficult outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author shouldn't have meddled in someone else's marriage, especially from afar. But given the close relationship and the suspicious circumstances, their concern could be seen as justified. The author didn't have direct evidence but acted on a feeling, which might be risky, but in the end, it exposed the cheating. The family's criticism seems to be misdirected, as the real issue was Annie's betrayal.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while perhaps intrusive, were motivated by wanting to help a friend (Frank) uncover a serious betrayal. The blame should be on Annie for the infidelity, not the author for trying to bring the truth to light. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
