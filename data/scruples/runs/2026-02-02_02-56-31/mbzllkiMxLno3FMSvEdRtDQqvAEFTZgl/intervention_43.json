I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation is that the user, let's call them Alex, has been friends with Annie since childhood. Annie married Frank, who's in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years, Annie didn't openly admit to cheating, but Alex sensed something. When Frank announced a pregnancy, Alex, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and is moving back home, while Alex is being criticized by their parents and family for ruining the marriage. They're isolated, and Frank is moving to their city.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if Alex is in the wrong. The key points are: Did Alex overstep by suggesting the paternity test? Was there a right to privacy or not? Cheating is a personal matter, and maybe Alex shouldn't have intervened. But on the other hand, if Alex had a legitimate concern and Frank trusted them enough to act on that advice, maybe Alex wasn't wrong. The problem is that Alex's suggestion led to the breakdown of the marriage. However, Annie was the one who cheated, so maybe Alex did the right thing by helping Frank uncover the truth.\n\nBut wait, Frank didn't know about the affair until Alex suggested the test. Was Alex justified in making that suggestion without concrete evidence? Since it was based on a feeling, maybe Alex should have kept quiet. But Frank did later do the test on his own, so the suggestion might have been the catalyst. The family is blaming Alex for the marriage's end, but perhaps they should be focusing on Annie's actions. Alex isn't the one who cheated; they just helped uncover it. Still, intervening in someone's marriage without being asked can be seen as crossing a line. \n\nOn the other hand, if Frank had a right to know about the infidelity, especially regarding the child's paternity, then Alex's action might be justified. The family's criticism might be misplaced. The user is defending their stance, saying Annie created the situation and using the child as an excuse isn't fair. The user's parents think they should have kept quiet, but the user believes Annie was at fault.\n\nSo, considering these points, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the user helped Frank discover the truth about his wife's infidelity, which led to the breakup. The user isn't the one who cheated; they acted on a suspicion and it turned out to be true. The family's blame is misplaced, and the user isn't responsible for Annie's actions. However, if the user had no right to interfere, maybe A. But given the outcome, it seems the user was supporting the wronged party.\n"
