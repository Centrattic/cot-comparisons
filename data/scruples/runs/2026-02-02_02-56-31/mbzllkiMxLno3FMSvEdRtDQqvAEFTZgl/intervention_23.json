  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by supporting their friend Frank who found out his wife Annie cheated, leading to their divorce. The situation is that the user, living far away, had a feeling Annie was cheating and suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery. Now the user is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage and is isolated.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to help Frank by voicing a suspicion. But maybe they overstepped by suggesting the test? However, Frank did take the suggestion seriously and acted on it, so perhaps the user isn't entirely at fault. The key points are: Annie was unfaithful, the user was a friend, and Frank made the decision based on the suggestion. \n\nThe user's family is blaming them for the fallout, but the real responsibility lies with Annie for cheating. The user didn't force Frank to get the test, he chose to. The user might feel they were just trying to help, but maybe they should have approached it differently. However, given the emotional cheating and the child not being Frank's, the marriage was already problematic. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They might have been concerned, but the main issue is Annie's actions. The user isn't the one who cheated. They tried to help a friend. So the answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
