It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage, where Annie cheated, leading to the baby not being Frank's. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery and the marital breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's role: they noticed something off, asked Frank about a paternity test after some alcohol, and this led to Frank getting tested. The friends and family blame the author for ruining the marriage, while the author defends their stance, thinking Annie was at fault.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author had concerns about Annie's fidelity but didn't have concrete evidence. Suggesting a paternity test might be seen as an overstep, especially if it's based on a feeling rather than facts. However, the author's intention was to confirm Frank's suspicions, which turned out to be valid. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author's suggestion led directly to the test. Even if Annie was cheating, the author's intervention caused the marital breakdown. Friends and family might see it as meddling. However, the author's motivation was to prevent Frank from being deceived, possibly protecting him from raising a child that isn't his. \n\nOn the other hand, without proof, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as harmful, especially in a close relationship where the author might have overstepped their role. The fact that Annie was emotionally cheating and had a child with someone else is her fault, but the author's action was the catalyst for the breakup. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? It's a gray area. They acted on a hunch, which was correct, but their interference caused immediate consequences. While Annie's actions were wrong, the author's role in exposing it could be seen as contributing to the breakdown. However, the author might argue they were helping Frank avoid being deceived. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and actions. The author had good intentions but perhaps overstepped by pushing for a test without clear evidence. However, since the test revealed the truth, maybe it's justified. But the social fallout is on the author because their words led to the test. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's action was a reasonable step or an overreach. Given that the author wasn't a party to the marriage and acted on a feeling, it's possible they're seen as overstepping. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong). But if the community values honesty and preventing deception, maybe B (not in the wrong). It's a tough call. However, in many AITA cases, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence can be seen as problematic. So maybe A.\n"
