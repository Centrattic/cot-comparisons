I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the situation: Annie and Frank were married three years, with Frank working 14 days on, 14 off. The user, a close friend of Annie since childhood, noticed signs of infidelity but couldn't act on them due to distance. When Frank found out the child wasn't his, he got a paternity test, leading to the marriage breakdown. The user's suggestion during drinking led to the test, and now they're being blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe user's parents and siblings think they should have stayed silent and are criticizing them. The user defends themselves, saying Annie created the situation and using the child as an excuse is unfair. Now both the user and Frank are isolated, and Frank is moving away.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. \n\nPoints to consider: The user's intention was to address their suspicion about the child's paternity. They didn't have direct evidence but felt something was off. The user suggested a paternity test, which Frank acted on, leading to the truth. However, the user's comment was made in a casual setting (after beers), which might have come off as accusatory without proof. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if you suspect infidelity but lack proof, bringing up a paternity test could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's based on hunches. However, if the husband himself later takes action based on that suggestion, the responsibility might shift more onto Frank. \n\nThe user is being blamed by their family, but the root cause was Annie's infidelity. The user's action was an honest concern expressed without knowing the exact truth. However, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be viewed as meddling, even if well-intentioned. \n\nBut the user's friendship with Annie and their long-standing relationship might have given them the position to voice concerns. Still, they might not be the ones to push for a paternity test, which is a serious matter. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The user didn't commit a crime but might have overstepped by implying suspicion without proof. However, if Frank independently decided to take action after the suggestion, the user's role is indirect. \n\nThe family's criticism might be misplaced, as the primary issue was Annie's actions. The user's support for Frank is justified if they believe Frank was cheated on, but the method of bringing up the paternity test could be questioned. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user is not entirely in the wrong, but they might have acted in a way that's socially sensitive. However, the main wrongdoer is Annie. The user's action was a suggestion that led to a necessary truth, even if it caused conflict. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
