  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. So, the story is about Frank and Annie. The user is close to Annie, almost like a sister. Frank was in the oil industry with long shifts, and during their marriage, Annie had an affair. The user sensed something was off but couldn't act on it due to distance. When the baby came, the user suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out it wasn't his. Now, the user is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, the user's role here is complex. They were a close friend to Annie, but they had a feeling something was wrong. The suggestion of a paternity test was made after drinking, which might not have been the best approach. However, the user's intention was to ensure Frank wasn't a father to someone else's child. The user isn't the one who cheated; Annie was the one who had the affair and created the situation. \n\nThe user's family is blaming them for the fallout, but the main responsibility lies with Annie for her infidelity and not being honest. The user was acting on their concern, even if it came out in a socially awkward way. Frank's decision to take the test and leave is his choice, but the user isn't the one who caused the affair. \n\nThe user's support for Frank is justified because they were trying to help him avoid being wronged further. The fact that the user is being isolated and blamed by their own family is unfortunate, but it's their family's reaction that's problematic, not the user's actions. The user didn't create the situation; they exposed it. The answer here would be that the user isn't in the wrong because they were trying to do the right thing by ensuring Frank's paternity and protecting him from being deceived. The wrong was done by Annie, not the user.\n"
