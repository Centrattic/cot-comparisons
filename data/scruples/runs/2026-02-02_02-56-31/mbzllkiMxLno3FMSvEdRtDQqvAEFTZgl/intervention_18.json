  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after he found out his wife Annie was cheating and the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user has known Annie since childhood, like a sister. Frank works in oil, 14 days on, 14 off. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the user had a feeling. The user suggested a paternity test to Frank while they were drunk, which led to Frank getting the test and discovering the infidelity. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The user is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage and is isolated. They feel Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nThe user is asking if they're wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nSo, the key points here are: the user's suggestion led to Frank getting a paternity test, which revealed the cheating. The user is being blamed for the fallout. But Annie was the one who cheated. The user's intention was to help Frank by suggesting the test, even if it was in a drunken moment. However, the way it was done might have been inappropriate. But was the user wrong in making the suggestion? \n\nOn one hand, the user might not be at fault because Annie was the one who was unfaithful. The user's concern was based on suspicion, and the test revealed the truth. On the other hand, bringing up the idea of a paternity test, even in a joking or drunken manner, could have been a sensitive topic. However, if the user believed something was wrong and encouraged Frank to take action, maybe they had good intentions. \n\nBut the user's family is criticizing them for meddling. However, the user is defending their stance that Annie was responsible. The child being used as an excuse is a red herring because the cheating happened first. The user's action was a catalyst for Frank to act, but the root cause was Annie's infidelity. So, the user might not be in the wrong because they were trying to address their suspicions, even if it led to the breakup. \n\nBut maybe the user overstepped by suggesting the test. However, given that Annie was cheating, maybe the user was right to voice concerns. It's a tough call. The main responsibility lies with Annie for cheating, not the user for pointing it out. So the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
