  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault here. So the story is about their friend Annie, who got married to Frank. The user has known Annie since they were babies. Frank works in oil and has a work schedule that's two weeks on, two weeks off. Over three years of marriage, Annie was having an affair, and the child isn't Frank's. The user, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test, which led Frank to actually get one. Now Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back in with her parents. The user is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage and causing the separation. The user is trying to stick up for Frank, saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The user didn't know for sure Annie was cheating but had a feeling. They suggested a paternity test, which Frank took seriously. But the user's suggestion led to the test that revealed the infidelity. Now, the user is being blamed for the fallout.\n\nFirst, was the user's suggestion crossing a line? If they didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling, bringing up the idea of a paternity test might be seen as interfering. But considering their close relationship with both Frank and Annie, maybe they thought they were helping. However, the user might not have realized how sensitive that topic is. Suggesting a paternity test is a big deal, especially in a relationship where one partner is away a lot. It could be seen as an accusation without proof. Even if the user had a feeling, they might have overstepped by making the suggestion, especially after drinking. Frank might have taken the comment seriously because he was vulnerable or already had doubts.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie was cheating and lying. The user's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth. But the method of doing it by suggesting a paternity test might not have been the best approach. The user could have approached it differently, maybe by encouraging Frank to talk to Annie directly instead of jumping to a paternity test. Also, the user's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage, but Annie's actions were the root cause. The user's suggestion was just the catalyst that exposed the existing problem.\n\nThe user might not be entirely at fault because the cheating was on Annie's part, but their role in suggesting the test did contribute to the breakdown of the marriage. However, if they genuinely believed Annie was being unfaithful and were trying to help Frank, their intentions were good. The key point is whether suggesting the test was an overstep. Since there was no proof, just a feeling, the user might have acted prematurely. But in a situation where trust is broken, sometimes actions like that are necessary. It's a gray area. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be that the user isn't entirely wrong, but there's some responsibility. However, the main blame lies with Annie for her actions. The user's suggestion was a reaction to their suspicions, even if it led to consequences. The question is whether the user overstepped. If the user had a close relationship with both parties and was trying to help, maybe they're not entirely wrong. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
