  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The situation is that the user's sister figure, Annie, had an affair and had a child who isn't Frank's. The user suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery. Now, the user is being criticized by family for causing the breakdown of the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user knew Annie since childhood, and Frank was married to her. The user had a suspicion but didn't directly accuse, just suggested a paternity test after drinking. Frank acted on it, found out the truth, and now the marriage is over. The user is facing backlash from their family for not staying silent, and they argue that Annie was at fault, not them.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user's actions were based on suspicion, not evidence. They made a suggestion that led to the truth coming out, which caused the marriage to end. However, the user wasn't involved in the affair itself. The main ethical consideration here is whether the user had the right to bring up the paternity test suggestion, especially given the distance and the fact that they were close to both parties.\n\nOn one hand, the user might have felt a responsibility to their friend Frank, especially if they had a close relationship. But on the other hand, they might have overstepped by making that suggestion without concrete evidence. The user's intention was to uncover the truth, but the method could be seen as intrusive. However, since Annie was the one who cheated and the child isn't Frank's, the user isn't directly responsible for the affair. The suggestion might have been the catalyst for the truth coming out, but the core issue was Annie's actions.\n\nThe family is blaming the user for ruining the marriage, but the marriage was already strained due to the infidelity. The user's role was a trigger, but the root cause was Annie's actions. So, the user might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank discover the truth, albeit in a way that caused immediate fallout. However, maybe the user should have approached it differently, like encouraging Frank to confront Annie directly rather than suggesting a paternity test.\n\nBut in terms of moral responsibility, the user isn't the one who committed the infidelity. They were acting on their suspicions and tried to help Frank. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). The user had a suspicion and acted on it, but the blame lies more on Annie for the cheating and the subsequent consequences. The user's suggestion, while possibly tactically unwise, wasn't an act of betrayal but an attempt to uncover the truth.\n"
