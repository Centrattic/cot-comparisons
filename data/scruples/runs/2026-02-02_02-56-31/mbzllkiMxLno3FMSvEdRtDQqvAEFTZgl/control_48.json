It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Annie cheated on her husband Frank. The author, who's close to both, noticed signs and later suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out the child isn't his. Now, Frank and the author are being blamed by family for causing the breakup, and the author is standing by Frank, arguing Annie was at fault.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong by supporting Frank. Let's consider the key points. Cheating is generally considered wrong, so the author isn't wrong for being on Frank's side here. The author's suggestion of a paternity test was after drinking, but it led Frank to get the test, which confirmed his fears. The author argues that Annie created the situation by cheating, which is a valid point. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. By suggesting the test, they might have been overstepping. However, Frank decided to go through with it, so the author's role was to raise a possibility, not force the action. \n\nThe family is criticizing the author for ruining the marriage, but the marriage was already in trouble due to Annie's infidelity. The author isn't responsible for Annie's actions. Frank's decision to leave is a consequence of the cheating, not the author's suggestion. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting Frank, who is the wronged party here. The answer should be B.\n"
