It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's sister figure, Annie, married Frank, who works in oil and is away for two weeks on and off. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. Then when Annie gets pregnant, the author, after some drinking, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes it seriously, the test shows he's not the father. The marriage falls apart, and now the author is getting blamed for ruining the marriage. The author feels Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating, and they think Frank is being immature, but their family is upset with them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author overstep by suggesting the paternity test? Was there a reason to do so? The author had suspicions but no evidence. They mentioned the test in a casual setting, possibly after drinking, which might not have been the best approach. However, the test was actually done because Frank took the suggestion seriously. The result proved the author's suspicions were correct. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the author didn't have concrete evidence but acted on a hunch, maybe they should have handled it differently. However, if the intent was to protect Frank from being cheated on and to ensure the child's legitimacy, then maybe they had good intentions. The problem is that the author's suggestion led to the breakdown of the marriage, which is why people are blaming them. But Annie was the one who cheated, emotionally and possibly physically. \n\nThe author's role is complicated. They tried to help Frank, but their method might have been flawed. However, the main responsibility lies with Annie for her infidelity. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to uncover the truth, even if their approach was a bit hasty. On the other hand, suggesting a paternity test without more evidence could be seen as undermining the marriage. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the author had a genuine concern based on long-term observations, maybe it's understandable. But the way they brought it up (after drinking) might not be the best approach. Still, the outcome showed that the author's suspicions were correct. So, considering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author was trying to help Frank, and the problem was Annie's actions. The author isn't responsible for the cheating; they just acted on a suspicion, even if the method was a bit clumsy.\n"
