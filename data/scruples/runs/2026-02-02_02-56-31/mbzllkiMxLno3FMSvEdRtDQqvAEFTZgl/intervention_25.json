  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the husband who got cheated on. The situation is that Annie had an affair, had a child not Frank's, and the user suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery. Now the user is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, the user's role: They're a close friend/sister to Annie and the user's own family is criticizing them. The main question is whether the user is at fault. The key points are that Annie didn't directly confess, the user had a feeling but couldn't do much due to distance. Then, after some prompting, the user suggested the paternity test, which led to Frank finding out. \n\nThe user's defense is that the cheating was on Annie, so they're not responsible. The family is saying the user shouldn't have said anything. But the user is standing by their belief that Annie created the situation. The user is trying to justify their action as necessary to uncover the truth.\n\nIn terms of ethics, did the user overstep? The user's suggestion led to the test, but the cheating was already happening. The user's intention was to help confirm the truth. However, the method involved getting Frank to do it after the user's comment. But the root cause was Annie's infidelity. The user's role was more of a catalyst, not the actual cheater. \n\nThe user might argue that they had a right to express their concerns, especially given the close relationship. Annie's actions were the main issue. The user's family is blaming them, but the responsibility lies with Annie for the affair. So the user isn't in the wrong for bringing up the possibility, even if it led to the test. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
