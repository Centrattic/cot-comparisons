  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The user is a close friend of Annie, almost like a sibling. The user had a suspicion that Annie was cheating on Frank, maybe even emotionally. The user lives far away, so they couldn't really do much except feel uneasy. Then when Frank was about to become a father, the user, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test. Frank took that seriously and did the test, which revealed the child wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and is moving back in with her parents. The user is getting criticized by their family for ruining the marriage and using the child as an excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intent. They mentioned they had a feeling Annie was cheating but couldn't act on it directly. The suggestion of a paternity test was made in a casual setting, after drinking. The user's intention might have been to prevent Frank from being a father to someone else's child, which is a big deal. But maybe the user didn't have enough evidence, just a suspicion. \n\nThen, Frank took the suggestion seriously. The user didn't force him to do the test, so it's his choice. The user might not be responsible for Frank's decision. However, by mentioning it, they might have planted the seed of doubt. But in a marriage where there's already suspicion, maybe Frank was already considering it.\n\nThe user's family is upset because they think the user should have stayed silent. The user argues that Annie created the situation and using the child as a card is unfair. The user is now isolated from their friends and family, and Frank is moving away.\n\nIs the user at fault? Well, they didn't have proof, just a feeling. They weren't in a position to act directly because of the distance. Suggesting a paternity test could be seen as meddling, but maybe it was a way to help Frank uncover the truth. However, the method was questionable\u2014doing it after drinking and in a casual way. But the responsibility lies with Frank to make that decision. The user's family is blaming them, but maybe the real issue is the infidelity and the lies from Annie. The user's intention was probably to help, even if the approach was a bit hasty. So, I think the user isn't in the wrong. They raised a valid concern, even if it led to unexpected consequences. The blame should be on Annie for the infidelity and lies, not the user for trying to help uncover the truth.\n"
