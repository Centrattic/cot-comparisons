  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the situation: Annie married Frank, who's in the oil industry with a long work schedule. For three years, Annie had an affair, and the child isn't Frank's. The user, being close to Annie as a sister, suggested the paternity test during a casual conversation after some drinks. Frank took the suggestion seriously and got the test, leading to the discovery of the affair and his wife's deceit.\n\nThe user is now facing backlash from their family for \"ruining the marriage\" and is being told to consider the child's well-being, while Frank is seen as immature. The user stands by their belief that Annie was at fault and refuses to be blamed.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The user didn't know for sure about the affair; they had a feeling but no proof. They made a suggestion in a casual setting, not intending to cause harm. The user's concern was valid given the circumstances\u2014Frank was the one being cheated on, and the child's paternity was at stake. The user isn't the one who committed the infidelity or lied. They were trying to help Frank uncover the truth, which, while it led to the breakup, was based on suspicions the user couldn't ignore.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the user shouldn't have brought up the paternity test without more concrete evidence, as it led to the marriage's collapse. But others might say that Frank's reaction was his own choice, and the user was just voicing a concern they had. The user's actions were a result of a suspicion they couldn't shake off, and they were looking out for Frank's interests as a friend. The fact that Frank later acted on the suggestion shows that the user's intuition was correct, even if it came from a place of uncertainty.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the primary wrongdoer is Annie for the affair and deception. The user's role was minimal\u2014offering a suggestion in good faith. The user isn't the one who caused the initial problem. They're being blamed by their family, but their actions were a response to a situation they were invested in. The user's support for Frank is justified given the betrayal Annie committed.\n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. They acted based on concerns they had, and the consequences were a result of Frank's decision to take the suggestion seriously. The blame should lie with Annie for her actions, not the user who tried to help uncover the truth.\n"
