  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation is that the user's sister-in-law, Annie, had an affair, and the kid isn't Frank's. The user suggested a paternity test, which led to the truth coming out. Now the user is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user noticed something was off but couldn't do much from afar. They made a comment about a paternity test when they were drunk, which Frank later acted on. The paternity test revealed the infidelity. Now, the user is being criticized for speaking up.\n\nIs the user at fault? Well, Annie was the one who cheated, so she's responsible for creating the situation. The user's comment might have been a nudge, but does that make them wrong? They were trying to help Frank, maybe thinking he was being too trusting. But suggesting a paternity test isn't a direct accusation unless there's proof. However, the user's family is saying they should've stayed silent.\n\nOn one hand, the user was concerned and acted on their suspicions. On the other, they might have overstepped by bringing up the test without more evidence. But since the test confirmed the affair, maybe the user's intention was good. The real blame lies with Annie for cheating. The user's family is focusing on the wrong person. So the answer is probably B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
