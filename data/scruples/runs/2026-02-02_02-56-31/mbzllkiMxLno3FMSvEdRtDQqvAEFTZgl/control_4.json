It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author's suggestion led Frank to get a paternity test, revealing that the child isn't his. Now, Frank is estranged from his family and friends, and the author is being criticized for speaking out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is close to Annie, who is his sister-in-law. Annie was married to Frank, who was away for long periods. The author suspected Annie was cheating and suggested a paternity test. Frank did the test, found out the child wasn't his, and now he's moving away, and the author is being blamed by his family.\n\nThe author's defense is that Annie was the one who created the situation, and using the child as an excuse is unfair. He stands by his suggestion.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Did the author overstep? He was concerned about the marriage's integrity and Frank's potential paternity. However, he made the suggestion after drinking, which might have been a bad time. But his intention was to make sure Frank was certain, which is understandable. However, by voicing this, he inadvertently caused the marriage to end, leading to Frank's financial and social consequences.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a suspicion and tried to help Frank. On the other hand, he might have intruded into a private matter without concrete evidence. The problem is that the author wasn't in a direct position to intervene, given the distance and the fact that Annie's infidelity wasn't confirmed before his suggestion.\n\nBut Frank had the right to know if he was the biological father. The author's suggestion was a way to confirm that. However, the way he approached it, perhaps in a casual setting after drinking, might have been inappropriate. Still, the underlying concern was valid. \n\nThe key question is whether the author had the right to suggest the paternity test. Since Frank was the one who ended up acting on it, the author's role was to raise a valid concern. However, the author might have overstepped by making it his business to intervene, even if with good intentions. \n\nBut given that Annie was his sister and Frank was his brother-in-law, perhaps the author felt a responsibility. However, the author's family is blaming him for ruining the marriage. The author's stance is that Annie was at fault, not him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action led to Frank finding out, which is a truth that needed to be known. But maybe he shouldn't have brought it up without being directly asked. The line between helping and meddlesome is thin here. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had valid concerns, inserting himself into the situation might have been overstepping, especially without being directly involved or Frank's explicit consent. Therefore, the author could be considered partially at fault. However, the main wrongdoer is Annie for cheating. The author's role was a catalyst, but his intention was to inform, which is morally justifiable. So, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance.\n"
