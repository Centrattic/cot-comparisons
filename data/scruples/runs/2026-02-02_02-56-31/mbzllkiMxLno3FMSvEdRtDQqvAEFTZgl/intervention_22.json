  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The situation is that Annie had an affair and had a child with someone else. The user, who's close to Annie, suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery. Now, both the user and Frank are being blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The user is defending their actions, saying Annie was the one who created the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is generally considered wrong in most societies, so Annie is at fault for the infidelity. The user's suggestion for a paternity test might have been a good idea if Frank was suspicious, but the user was a friend to both parties. However, the user's comment was made after drinking, which might have been a slip. But the user didn't know for sure that Annie cheated; they just had a feeling. So, was it right to suggest the test?\n\nThe user's intention wasn't to sabotage the marriage, but to help Frank find the truth. However, the way it came out might have been intrusive. The user might have overstepped by not giving Annie the chance to address it first. But on the other hand, Frank had a right to know if the child wasn't his. The user's role here is complex because they were close to Annie, so they might have been biased but still wanted to help Frank.\n\nNow, considering the aftermath, the user is getting criticized for speaking up. The family is saying the user ruined the marriage, but the real issue was Annie's infidelity. The user's actions led to the truth coming out, which might have been unavoidable. Frank's decision to get the test was his own, even if the user's suggestion prompted it. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to be honest with Frank. However, the method of doing it after drinking might have been careless.\n\nIn terms of the child, it's a factor, but the responsibility lies with Annie for having an affair. The user isn't the parent, so using the child as a card against the user is unfair. Frank should have considered the child's welfare, but again, Annie's actions were the root cause. The user's support for Frank is justified given the circumstances. So, the user isn't in the wrong; the blame should be on Annie for the cheating. The answer would be B.\n"
