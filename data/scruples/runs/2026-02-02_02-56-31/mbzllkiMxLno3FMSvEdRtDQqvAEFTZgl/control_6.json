It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, and suggesting a paternity test.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author's best friend is Annie, who married Frank. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly admitted to infidelity, but the author had a suspicion. When Annie got pregnant, the author, during a party, suggested a paternity test to Frank. This led Frank to push for a test, which confirmed he wasn't the father. Now Annie is facing being without Frank's income and a home, and the author is criticized by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author's role here was to be a friend to both Frank and Annie. The key issue is the paternity test suggestion. The author's intention was to help Frank confirm the paternity, possibly because they suspected Annie was cheating. But was it the author's place to make that suggestion?\n\nOn one hand, the author wasn't a part of the marriage, so maybe they shouldn't have stepped in. The paternity test was a significant action that led to the breakup. By suggesting it, the author might have caused harm. Also, the author's parents and siblings think they should have kept their mouth shut, which adds to the social consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, Frank might have been in denial about the infidelity. The author's concern could have been valid if they truly believed there was a chance the child wasn't Frank's. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. The author's suggestion might have been a way to protect Frank from being in an abusive or deceitful situation long-term. \n\nBut where's the line between helping a friend and overstepping? Friendship often involves advice, but when it comes to marriage issues, it's a sensitive area. The author might have overstepped by pushing Frank to take a decisive action that led to the dissolution of the marriage. However, if Frank was already considering a test and the author just confirmed his suspicions, maybe the author did the right thing.\n\nAnother angle: the author's relationship with Annie. If the author knew Annie had been unfaithful and the child wasn't Frank's, maybe the author had a moral duty to tell Frank. But the author didn't have proof, only suspicions. This could be seen as interfering based on assumptions.\n\nAlso, the author is now being blamed by family for the fallout. That's a social consequence they might not have anticipated. The question is whether the author's actions were justified despite the negative outcomes.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the author's intention was to protect Frank from being a father to a child that isn't his due to Annie's infidelity, then it could be seen as the right thing. However, the method of approaching it\u2014without evidence and during a party\u2014might have been inappropriate. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author acted with good intentions but without full knowledge, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author's actions were meddling in a private matter without being asked, then they might be in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author had the right to interfere. Since the author wasn't part of the marriage and acted on a suspicion without proof, it's possible they overstepped. However, if their intent was to help Frank, maybe they aren't entirely to blame. The situation is complicated because the author's actions led to the breakup, but they might have been trying to expose a deceitful situation.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. But given that the author acted on a hunch without evidence and caused significant harm, maybe they are in the wrong. However, if the alternative is Frank living a lie, it's less clear. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, the answer might be A (yes), because the author meddled in a private matter without being asked, leading to the marriage's collapse.\n"
