It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author has been friends with Annie for a long time, almost like family. The main issue is that Annie's husband, Frank, found out the child isn't his because the author suggested a paternity test. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating but had a feeling. Then, after a few beers, the author casually mentioned the paternity test idea, which led Frank to push for it. Now, Annie is facing financial and housing issues, and the author is being criticized by their parents and siblings for ruining the marriage.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Let's consider the facts. The author didn't have concrete proof of infidelity, just a suspicion. They were concerned about the baby's paternity but didn't have a right to interfere. The author's intention might have been to help Frank, but suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as meddling. However, since Frank ended up acting on it and the result was negative, the author's role is indirect. \n\nFrank is the one who decided to go through with the test, even if it was influenced by the author. The author might have overstepped by bringing up the suggestion, especially without knowing the full story. But maybe they thought they were helping. On the flip side, Annie was emotionally cheating, which is wrong, but the author's action led to the exposure of that. \n\nThe author is now isolated and being blamed. The question is whether their suggestion was a breach of trust or an appropriate concern. Since they had a close relationship with Annie, they might have felt entitled to say something. But the outcome was negative. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author had no proof and just acted on a feeling, that could be considered meddling. However, the fact that Annie was cheating makes the situation more nuanced. The author might not be entirely at fault, but they did play a role in the breakdown. The answer might depend on the cultural context of AITA (Am I the Asshole) where the line is often drawn between intentions and consequences. The author's intention was to help Frank, but the consequence was harmful. In such cases, people often argue that even if the intention was good, the action could still be seen as wrong if it caused harm without certainty. \n\nSo, I think the author might be considered partly at fault because they suggested the test without concrete evidence. However, the main responsibility lies with Frank for acting on it and Annie for cheating. Still, the author's role is questionable, so the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (No). But in AITA terms, sometimes even if you're not the main culprit, if you made a mistake that contributed, you might be called an asshole. Given that, the answer might be A.\n"
