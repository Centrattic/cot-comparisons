I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation involves their sister-like friend Annie and her husband Frank. The user suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery that the child isn't Frank's. Now, the user is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The user noticed something off but couldn't do much due to distance. They brought up the paternity test idea when Frank was drunk, which he later acted on. The key here is whether the user had a right to intervene. Since Annie was emotionally cheating and the child isn't Frank's, the user's suggestion might have been a way to help Frank get the truth. However, suggesting a paternity test is a big step and could be seen as intrusive if not directly asked.\n\nNext, the user's family is upset because they think the user shouldn't have said anything. They use the child as a reason to criticize Frank's reaction. But if Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating, the user's role in uncovering the truth could be justified. However, the user didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. So, was it right to push for a test based on that?\n\nAlso, the user's intention matters. They were trying to help Frank, but maybe they overstepped. The fact that Frank acted on the suggestion shows he had doubts too. The user's actions led to a breakup, but if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the marriage was already unstable. \n\nConsidering all angles, the user might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend's sibling. But they might have crossed a line by making a suggestion that led to breaking up a family. However, since the cheating existed, the user's role is more of an enabler for the truth to come out. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the user was acting on concern and the cheating was the root issue.\n"
