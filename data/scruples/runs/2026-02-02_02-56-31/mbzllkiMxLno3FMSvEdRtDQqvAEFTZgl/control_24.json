It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie cheated on Frank. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected the cheating but didn't confront her directly. Then, when Frank was about to have a child, the author jokingly suggested a paternity test after some drinks. That led Frank to actually get the test, which revealed the child wasn't his. Now, Annie is in a tough spot financially and socially, and the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions were wrong. The author suspected infidelity but didn't have concrete evidence. They made a comment under the influence of alcohol, which Frank took seriously enough to act on. The author's intention might have been to nudge Frank to check, but did they overstep? \n\nOn one hand, the author had a close relationship with both Frank and Annie. They might have felt it was their place to say something, especially since they had a long history. But on the other hand, they didn't have proof and the situation was sensitive. The comment was made in a casual, drunk conversation, which could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. \n\nFrank's reaction led to the paternity test, which confirmed the cheating. Now, Annie is facing consequences like losing her home and income. The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have interfered. The author feels they were right to support Frank, but the method might be questionable.\n\nIs it the author's fault? They didn't have evidence to accuse Annie directly, but they did express a suspicion that led to action. However, the ultimate responsibility for the cheating lies with Annie. The author's suggestion might have been a catalyst, but it was Frank's decision to take the test. Still, in a situation without proof, bringing it up in a casual way might have been unwise. \n\nThe author might have overstepped by making a comment that led to public shame for Annie and fractured relationships. Even if they were concerned about Frank being deceived, they could have approached it more carefully. The key here is whether the author had the right to intervene without evidence. Since they were close to both parties, their intention might have been good, but the method could be seen as meddling. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they acted on suspicion without proof, leading to consequences. However, some might argue that supporting Frank was right, but the approach was flawed. The line between supporting a friend and overstepping can be thin here. Considering the lack of evidence and the impact of their comment, the author might share some blame.\n"
