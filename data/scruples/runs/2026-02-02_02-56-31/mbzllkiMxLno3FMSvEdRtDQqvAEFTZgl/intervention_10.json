I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The story involves their friend Annie, who married Frank. The user has known Annie since childhood. Frank was in the oil industry with a 14-day rotation, so he was away a lot. During their three-year marriage, Annie might have been having an affair, but it wasn't confirmed. The user visited, got tipsy, suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank getting one. The test showed the kid isn't his. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The user is getting backlash from family for suggesting the test. They feel Annie created the situation and using the child as an excuse is unfair. Both the user and Frank are isolated now. Frank is moving to their city.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they were wrong to suggest the paternity test. Let's break it down. First, the user didn't know for sure, they just had a feeling. They might have been wrong, but they voiced their concern. However, they were in a position of trust with Annie. By suggesting the test, they might have acted without concrete evidence, which could have been a breach of trust. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the user was trying to help Frank. But the user's role here is complicated. They are more like a friend to Annie, so maybe they should have stayed out of it. Also, the user's family is blaming them for ruining a marriage. But Annie did create the situation by cheating. The user's intention might have been to help, but the method was questionable. They didn't have proof, and their comment being taken seriously might have accelerated the breakdown. The child aspect is also a factor. Even if Annie cheated, bringing up the child's paternity complicates things. The user's actions led to consequences, so maybe they bear some responsibility. Alternatively, they were just a catalyst for what was already there. The answer hinges on whether the user overstepped by suggesting the test without solid evidence. If they had reason to believe, maybe not, but if it was just a hunch, maybe they were wrong to intervene. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) or B (not). But considering the lack of proof and the impact, A might be the safer answer. However, if Annie was actually cheating, the user might have been trying to help, but the way they approached it was flawed. So maybe the answer is A because of the lack of evidence and overstepping. But I need to decide between A and B based on the situation.\n"
