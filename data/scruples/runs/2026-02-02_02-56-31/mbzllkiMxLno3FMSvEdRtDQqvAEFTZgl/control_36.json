It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Frank and Annie. Annie cheated on Frank, and the author, who's like a brother to Annie, found out and suggested a paternity test to Frank. Frank did it and found out the kid wasn't his. Now Annie is left without support because Frank left her, and the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author had a feeling Annie was cheating but wasn't sure. He suggested the paternity test when they were both drunk. Frank took it seriously later. The author's parents and siblings think he shouldn't have said anything. The question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank in this situation.\n\nI think the key points are: the author didn't have proof, just a suspicion. He made a suggestion that led to the test, which revealed the cheating. But was he right to act on a suspicion without evidence? On one hand, maybe he was trying to help Frank find the truth. On the other hand, if Annie really was cheating, maybe the author overstepped by pushing for a paternity test without more concrete info. But if the test proved the baby wasn't Frank's, maybe his action was justified. The author's family thinks he ruined the marriage, but Annie was the one who cheated. So is the author wrong for trying to help Frank uncover the truth? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author had no malicious intent and was trying to help a friend, maybe he's not wrong. But suggesting a paternity test can be a big step, so maybe he should have handled it differently. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) because Annie was the one who cheated, and the author's action led to Frank uncovering the truth, which was the right outcome even if it caused conflict. The author wasn't the one who cheated, so maybe he isn't at fault.\n"
