It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister figure, Annie, and her husband Frank. The key points are that Annie was emotionally cheating, Frank found out after a paternity test suggested by the author, and now the author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's role was to suggest a paternity test. The question is whether that crosses a line. The author mentions that Annie's infidelity was a feeling they had, but there was no direct evidence. The author, living far away, might not have known the full context. Suggesting a paternity test could be seen as invasive, but also as helping Frank confirm his suspicions. However, since the author's comment led to Frank taking action, they might be seen as responsible for the fallout.\n\nAnother angle is the relationship dynamics. The author and Annie were close, like siblings. The author's parents and siblings think they should have stayed silent. The author is defending their stance by saying Annie created the situation and using the child as an excuse is unfair. The isolation of both the author and Frank from family complicates things. \n\nLegally, the author isn't responsible for Annie's actions, but socially and emotionally, the suggestion might have been a catalyst. It's a gray area. The author acted on a suspicion without proof, which could be seen as meddling. However, Frank was the one who decided to get the test, so the author might not be the main wrongdoer. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's action was a suggestion that led to the truth coming out. While it's understandable to feel conflicted, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main responsibility lies with Annie for her actions. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
