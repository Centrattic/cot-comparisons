It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-in-law, Annie, and her husband Frank. The key points are:\n\nAnnie married Frank, who works in oil with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author, who's close to the couple, suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't do much because they live far away. When Annie got pregnant, the author, after drinking, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, got a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage. The author believes Annie was at fault and thinks people are unfairly using the child as an excuse.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank and making the comment about the paternity test. \n\nFirst, the author's intention was to suggest a test because they had suspicions about the baby's paternity. The author wasn't certain but had a feeling. They mentioned it while drunk, which might have been careless. However, the act of bringing up a test that ultimately proved infidelity is a tricky point.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author brought up the idea, which led to Frank taking action. But does that make the author responsible for the breakup? Maybe not entirely. The actual fault lies with Annie for cheating, but the author's role is in question here. \n\nThe author's motivation was to address what they believed was an issue. If the author had concrete evidence, it might be different, but they only had suspicions. However, suggesting a paternity test can be a serious step. Even if they were drunk, if the comment led directly to the test and subsequent exposure, that's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue they were trying to help Frank. If Frank had no idea about the infidelity, the author's suggestion helped uncover the truth. But did they overstep by making the suggestion without more evidence?\n\nThere's a line between helping a friend and interfering. The author might have crossed that line by making the comment, especially in a vulnerable moment (after drinking). Even if the intention was good, the method could be questionable. The aftermath shows that the marriage ended, and the author is being blamed by their family for that.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't responsible for Annie's actions. But in terms of social responsibility, by suggesting the test, they might have played a role in the dissolution of the marriage. However, the primary responsibility for the infidelity is Annie's. The author's role is more of an indirect influence.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer depends on whether suggesting the test was a reasonable action given the suspicions. If the author had a genuine concern and Frank was already having doubts, maybe the suggestion wasn't entirely wrong. However, if the author acted on mere suspicion without concrete evidence, it might be seen as overstepping. The fact that the author was drunk adds to the recklessness of the comment.\n\nIn the end, while Annie is clearly at fault for cheating, the author's action contributed to the situation. Whether that makes them \"in the wrong\" is subjective. The community might see the author as not the asshole if they were trying to help, but others might argue they shouldn't have meddled. Given the context, I lean towards B (No), because the author was acting on suspicions to help a friend, even if it was done poorly, the main fault lies with Annie.\n"
