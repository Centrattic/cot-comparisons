It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is close to Annie, who is his sister-in-law. The key event was the author suggesting a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery that the baby wasn't his. The author's family is upset because they think he ruined a good marriage, while he believes Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Let's look at the facts. The author suspected infidelity but wasn't sure. He brought up the idea of a paternity test in a casual setting (after some beers), which Frank later acted on. The test revealed the child wasn't his. Now Frank is estranged from his family and friends, and Annie is dealing with the aftermath.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, did the author overstep? He had a suspicion but no proof. By suggesting the test, he might have acted on a hunch without concrete evidence. However, he wasn't directly accusing Annie; he was just making Frank consider it. On the other hand, the author's close relationship with Annie could have influenced his judgment, perhaps leading him to take sides.\n\nThe author's family is blaming him for the marriage breakdown, which is harsh because the infidelity was Annie's doing. But the author's intervention did lead to the discovery, which caused the split. Even though Frank had a right to know, the method of finding out might have been influenced by the author's suggestion.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who cheated, so he isn't the root cause. However, his action did play a role in the unraveling. But is that his fault? He was trying to help Frank, albeit in a possibly misguided way. The fact that he acted on a suspicion without proof could be seen as meddling, which might make him partially responsible. However, the primary responsibility for the cheating lies with Annie.\n\nThe author's family's criticism seems valid in that he might not have had the right to interfere. But the author's reasoning that Annie created the situation is correct. The dilemma here is between supporting a friend's family versus personal ethics.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't entirely to blame, he might have overstepped by suggesting the test without being certain. However, given that Frank later agreed to the test, the author's role might be seen as a catalyst but not the sole cause. The answer might hinge on whether the action was an overreach, but considering the outcome, the author isn't entirely wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
