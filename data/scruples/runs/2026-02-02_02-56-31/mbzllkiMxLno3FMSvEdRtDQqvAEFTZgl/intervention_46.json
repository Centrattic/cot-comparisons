  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about their friend Annie who cheated on her husband Frank. The person suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery that the child isn't Frank's. Now they're getting criticized for ruining the marriage and causing problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The question is whether the person did the right thing by suggesting the test. Annie had been cheating emotionally and probably physically, but Frank wasn't directly told. The person had a suspicion and, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, got the test, and found out the child isn't his.\n\nNow, the person is being blamed by their family for causing the marriage breakdown. They are defending themselves by saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nLegally and ethically, suggesting a paternity test isn't inherently wrong. Cheating is a betrayal, and the person might feel justified in wanting the truth. However, the manner in which it was suggested\u2014after drinking and maybe impulsively\u2014could be seen as insensitive. But the underlying issue is Annie's infidelity. The person isn't the one who cheated; they're the one who brought attention to a problem that already existed.\n\nThe real responsibility lies with Annie for her actions. The person's intention was to help Frank find out the truth, which he might not have done otherwise. While their suggestion might have accelerated the breakup, the marriage was already in trouble due to infidelity. So, the person isn't necessarily at fault for pointing out the truth. They might be unfairly blamed for a situation caused by Annie's cheating. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
