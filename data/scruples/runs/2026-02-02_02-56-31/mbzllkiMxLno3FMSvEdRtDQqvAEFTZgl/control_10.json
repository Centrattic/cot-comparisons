It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The situation is that Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author knew Annie since they were babies and considered her a sister. The author noticed that during Frank's 3-year marriage, Annie never admitted to cheating, but the author had a feeling. After a baby was announced, the author, during a visit with some beers, suggested a paternity test. That led Frank to get a test, revealing the child wasn't his. Now the author is getting criticized for ruining the marriage, and both they and Frank are isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the author's actions and their consequences. The author didn't have concrete evidence of infidelity but suggested a paternity test. Frank acted on that suggestion, leading to the discovery. The question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the paternity test.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might have been concerned about Frank being cheated on and wanted him to protect himself. However, suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as invasive. But the user mentions that Frank later admitted Annie was emotionally cheating, so the author's intuition was right. The problem is whether the method was appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie might have felt betrayed by the author's suggestion, especially without direct evidence. The author's family is criticizing them for ruining the marriage, but the author stands by their belief that Annie was at fault. The child being involved is a sensitive point here, but the author argues that Annie created the situation.\n\nLegally and ethically, people have the right to question paternity if they have reasonable suspicion. However, the author didn't have proof, just a feeling. In some cases, paternity testing can be a personal decision, but others might see the author's role as intrusive. The emotional impact on all parties is significant, but the author might not be entirely at fault if they genuinely believed Frank was being cheated on.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's actions were based on suspicion and a desire to help Frank, even if it led to a breakdown. Since the infidelity was confirmed, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the method of bringing it up (during a visit with alcohol) might have been hasty. But since the outcome was real, it's a gray area. The answer would depend on whether the suggestion was justified given the suspicion, even without proof. The user is asking for a yes or no, so based on the information, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author acted on a valid suspicion that turned out true, even if the approach was questionable.\n"
