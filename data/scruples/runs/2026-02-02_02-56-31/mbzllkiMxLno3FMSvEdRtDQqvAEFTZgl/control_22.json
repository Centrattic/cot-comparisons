It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is at fault. The situation involves Frank, Annie, and the author.\n\nSo the main points: The author has known Annie since childhood, and Annie married Frank. Frank works on an oil platform with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. During their marriage, the author had a suspicion that Annie was cheating, but since they live 1000 km apart, there wasn't much they could do. Then when Annie announces a pregnancy, the author, after drinking, suggests a paternity test. Frank ends up getting the test, which reveals the child isn't his. The author's suggestion is mentioned, leading to backlash from the family. Now the author is facing criticism for ruining the marriage and is supporting Frank, who's moving away. The author thinks Annie created the situation and that it's unfair to bring the child into it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The key action here is the author suggesting the paternity test. Was that the wrong move? Let's break it down.\n\nAnnie was married to Frank, and the author suspected infidelity. But there's no concrete evidence mentioned. The author's suggestion comes after a few beers, which might indicate it was a casual comment. However, Frank took it seriously and pushed for a test. The test confirmed the child isn't his. So, if Annie was unfaithful, leading to the child not being Frank's, then the author's comment might have been a catalyst. But was it the author's responsibility to intervene?\n\nThe author's role here is as a friend. They might have been concerned about Frank being cheated on, given the long-distance work schedule. But without evidence, the author's suggestion could be seen as a breach of privacy or overstepping. However, if Annie was actually cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then the author's concern was valid, but the way it was handled could be problematic. \n\nThe author's family is criticizing them for causing the marriage to fall apart. The author's defense is that Annie created the situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't have proof and just made a suggestion that ultimately led to the paternity test, which exposed the infidelity, maybe the author's actions were justified. However, if there was no evidence, the author might have acted recklessly, causing unnecessary harm. \n\nAnother angle: Emotional cheating was mentioned. Frank caught Annie in emotional cheating, which might have led to the affair. So Annie's actions caused the problem. The author's suggestion might have been a way to address Frank's suspicions, but it's a gray area. The author's responsibility here is unclear. Did they have a right to intervene? Or did they overstep by making that suggestion, especially after drinking?\n\nAlso, the author's family is upset that they didn't keep quiet. But the author's stance is that it's Annie's fault. The author is supporting Frank, and the community is divided. \n\nIn terms of morality, if the author had a legitimate concern and Frank ended up being right, maybe the author isn't at fault. However, if the author had no evidence and spread suspicion, that's different. The author's comment might have been a trigger, but Annie's actions were the root cause. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author acted responsibly. Since the author was close to both people and had a suspicion, maybe they had a good reason to bring it up. However, suggesting a paternity test is a serious step. It's possible that the author overstepped, especially if they didn't have concrete evidence. Alternatively, they were trying to protect Frank's interests. \n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The author might not be in the wrong because Annie was indeed unfaithful, but their method of handling it could be questioned. However, given the outcome that the truth came out, maybe the author's actions were justified. But considering the impact on the marriage and the child, it's possible the author is seen as at fault for causing the breakup. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's responsibility. If Annie was cheating, then the author isn't the one who created the situation. However, the author's comment led to the test, which caused Frank to end the marriage. So maybe the author shares some responsibility for not having enough evidence before suggesting the test. Alternatively, they were just voicing a suspicion, and Frank had his own reasons for pushing the test. \n\nI think the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong (B), because Annie was the one who cheated, but there's a gray area. However, since the author's suggestion led to the test and the fallout, some might say the author is at fault. But given that Annie was unfaithful, the author's role was to support Frank, so perhaps they aren't in the wrong.\n"
