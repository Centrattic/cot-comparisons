I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their friend Annie who married Frank, but Annie was cheating, and the baby isn't Frank's. The user, let's call them the narrator, suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery and the breakdown of the marriage. Now, the family is blaming the narrator for ruining the marriage, and the narrator is supporting Frank.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main question is whether the narrator did something wrong by suggesting the paternity test. Let's break it down.\n\nThe narrator has known Annie since childhood and acted as a sister. Frank was often away due to his job. The narrator had a suspicion but no proof. They mentioned their concerns to Frank after drinking, which led him to get a paternity test. The test confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and is moving in with her parents. The family is upset with the narrator, saying they should have kept quiet.\n\nSo, the narrator's actions were based on suspicion. They didn't have evidence, just a feeling. But they trusted their intuition enough to bring it up. Even though it was after a few beers, the comment stuck, leading Frank to take action. The user is defending Frank now, but the family is blaming them.\n\nIs the narrator responsible? Well, they didn't know for sure, but they planted the seed. However, they were trying to protect Frank from a potential situation where the child wasn't his. On the other hand, the narrator wasn't in a position to know for sure, and their suggestion might have caused unnecessary harm.\n\nThe question is whether they overstepped. The narrator's intention was to prevent Frank from being deceived, but they didn't have concrete evidence. In some ways, they acted out of concern for Frank. But suggesting a paternity test without proof could be seen as meddling. However, the outcome showed that the narrator was right. But does that justify their actions?\n\nAlso, the family is using the child's well-being as an argument against the narrator. But if the child is not Frank's, then Frank wasn't the intended parent, so maybe the family's argument is misplaced.\n\nThe user is standing by their decision, believing Annie was the one who created the situation. The user's support for Frank might be seen as loyalty to an innocent party, but their initial action could be seen as intrusive.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user didn't force Frank to take the test, just suggested it. Frank made the decision on his own. So maybe the user isn't directly responsible for the outcome. However, the suggestion was the catalyst.\n\nBut the user is being blamed by their family. The question is if that blame is justified. If the user had no malicious intent and was trying to help Frank, then maybe not. However, the user's action did lead to the marriage's collapse, which is a big deal.\n\nIn some perspectives, it's better to stay out of others' business unless there's clear evidence. The user's action, while possibly well-intentioned, might have been overstepping. But given that the outcome was accurate, maybe the user was right to act on their suspicion.\n\nBut the key here is whether the user is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their action was justified. Since they didn't have proof, but acted on a feeling, it's a gray area. However, the fact that the paternity test confirmed the infidelity might mean that the user's action was correct in the end, even if it caused harm.\n\nBut the question isn't about whether the user was right about the infidelity, but whether they were wrong in their action. So the user's action of suggesting the test might be seen as meddling, but since it was based on concern for their friend, it's a tricky situation.\n\nIn many cases, people might say that the user isn't in the wrong because they were trying to protect Frank from being deceived. However, others might argue that they shouldn't have interfered without proof. The answer could go either way, but given the outcome, the user's intention was to help, which might exonerate them. However, the method of suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAnother angle is that the user didn't have the right to interfere in Frank and Annie's marriage. Even if their intentions were good, they shouldn't have acted as a judge. But in this case, the user's action led to the truth coming out, which might be seen as the right result, even if it was painful.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong) because the user acted on a suspicion to protect their friend, and the outcome was correct. However, some might argue that they should have stayed out of it. But given the information, the user's action was based on their concern for Frank's well-being, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
