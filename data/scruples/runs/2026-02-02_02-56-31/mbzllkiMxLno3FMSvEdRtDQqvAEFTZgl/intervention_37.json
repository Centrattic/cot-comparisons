  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA - Supporting the cheated on husband\nStory is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after he found out his wife Annie had a child with someone else. The user suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery.\n\nFirst, the user's relationship with Annie is close, like a sister. They were friends since childhood. When Annie married Frank, they got along well. The user noticed something off but couldn't act on it from afar. Then, when the pregnancy happened, the user, after some alcohol, suggested a paternity test, which Frank took seriously. The test revealed the child wasn't his. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and home, and the user is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The user argues that Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. Both the user and Frank are now isolated, and Frank is moving away.\n\nKey points to consider: The user didn't know for sure about the cheating, just had a feeling. They made a suggestion in a casual setting, which Frank acted on. The user isn't directly cheating or involved in the affair. The user's family is blaming them for speaking up, but the user believes Annie was at fault. The user is supporting Frank, who was wronged, but their role in suggesting the test is under scrutiny.\n\nPossible angles: Was the user justified in making the suggestion? Could they have handled it differently? Did they overstep by bringing up the paternity test? On the other hand, Frank might have been in denial, and the user's input led to the truth coming out, which is fair. However, the user might not have enough evidence to make such a suggestion, which could have caused unnecessary harm. The user's intent was to ensure Frank wasn't being cheated on, which is understandable, but the method might be questionable.\n\nIn many cases, advising someone to get a paternity test when there's a suspicion can be seen as responsible, but doing it without concrete evidence might lead to conflicts. The user's suggestion, though made in a social setting, led to a significant outcome. However, since the user wasn't directly involved in the affair and was trying to help a friend, their actions could be seen as justified. The blame from family might stem from a lack of understanding of the situation's complexity.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The user isn't the one who cheated, but their role in exposing the infidelity might be seen as causing the breakup. However, considering Annie's actions, the user's intention was to protect Frank. The answer likely leans towards the user not being in the wrong because they were supporting someone who was wronged, even if their method of suggesting the test was a bit hasty. But there's also a chance that the user could have handled it differently to avoid the fallout. However, given the information, the main wrongdoer is Annie, so the user's actions, though they had consequences, weren't malicious.\n"
