I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend living together. The boyfriend uses the girl's car to visit his grandma, but each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her money each time. He's been told to pay for the gas or fill it up, but he doesn't. The girl then revokes his permission to use the car, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The girl is covering all maintenance, insurance, and gas costs for a car that's not hers. The boyfriend is using it without contributing financially, which seems unfair. He's also not following through on promises to fix the issue. The girl's actions are a response to his repeated disrespect for her property and financial contributions.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and mutual respect. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs he's incurring by using the car, which is a valid concern. The girl has given multiple warnings, and when he doesn't comply, she takes action to protect her interests. His reaction, accusing her of being petty, seems like a deflection from his own behavior.\n\nLegally, the car is hers, so she has the right to set the terms of its use. Ethically, when someone uses another's property, they should cover associated costs. The boyfriend's refusal to do so is the root of the problem. The girl's decision to stop allowing him to use the car is a reasonable consequence after multiple instances of non-compliance.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her rights and financial boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here.\n"
