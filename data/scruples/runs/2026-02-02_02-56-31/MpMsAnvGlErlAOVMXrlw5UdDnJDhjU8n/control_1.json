I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend use her car to visit his grandmother. The background info says they live together, have been in a three-year relationship. The boyfriend sold his car when he went to university two years ago. The author has her own car, which she's paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything because \"it's not his car.\" He borrows her car to visit his grandma 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. This has happened three times. She's been upset each time, and he just says sorry but doesn't remember next time. She warned him he can't borrow the car anymore if this continues. Now he wanted to take it again for a weekend trip, and she said no. He got angry, called her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The car is hers, she's paying for it. He's using it without contributing, and despite multiple warnings. He's not taking responsibility for the gas, which is a significant cost. She's setting a boundary, which he's crossing repeatedly. He's not respecting her property and her financial contributions. When she finally enforces the boundary, he reacts poorly, calling her names. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, she's right to be upset. He's using her resources without contributing, and she's within her rights to set boundaries about car usage. His behavior shows a lack of consideration and accountability. Her response is a reasonable self-defense of her property and finances. The boyfriend's reaction is not justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
