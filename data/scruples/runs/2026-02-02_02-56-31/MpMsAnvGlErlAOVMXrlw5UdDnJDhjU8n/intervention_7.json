I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow their car anymore because he's not refueling it or contributing to the costs. They live together, and he sold his car when he went back to university. The car is hers, and she's paying all the maintenance and insurance. He borrows it, takes it with a full tank, returns it empty, and this has happened multiple times. She's been warning him, but he keeps doing it, and now he's upset when she revoked his permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is hers, so she's the one responsible for it. When someone uses another person's property, especially something as expensive as a car, there should be mutual responsibility. He's using the car, which she's financially supporting, but he's not contributing to the costs. That seems unfair. The gas is part of the ongoing expenses, so expecting him to refill the tank or cover the cost makes sense.\n\nHe's been told multiple times, and despite promises to do better, he hasn't. That's a pattern of behavior that doesn't respect her boundaries. When she finally takes away the privilege, he's upset and accuses her of being petty. That reaction might indicate he doesn't see his actions as wrong, which is a red flag in terms of respect.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a communication issue. Did she clearly explain why this is a problem? She mentioned she's been irate each time, but maybe there was a lack of direct conversation about splitting costs or setting clear expectations. However, since he's living with her and using her car, it's reasonable to expect some financial contribution, especially for things like gas that are directly tied to his usage.\n\nAlso, considering they live together, shared responsibilities are typical. Even if the car is hers, shared living often involves shared expenses. But since he sold his car, maybe he's in a position where he can't contribute, but that doesn't justify not refueling her car. The argument that it's \"not his car\" seems dismissive of the shared living situation and mutual responsibilities.\n\nHis reaction of calling her names and bringing up past issues might be a deflection. She's enforcing a boundary because of his repeated actions, and he's upset about losing the privilege. From an outsider's perspective, she's standing up for her own resources and setting a boundary, which is reasonable. He's not respecting her property and financial contributions.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it seems like the boyfriend's actions are the issue here. The user is not in the wrong for setting a boundary after repeated offenses. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
