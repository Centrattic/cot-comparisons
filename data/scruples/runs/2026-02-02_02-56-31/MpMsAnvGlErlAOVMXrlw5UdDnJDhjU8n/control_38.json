I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining her gas tank without refilling it or contributing to costs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live together, they've been in a three-year relationship. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. Now, the author has her own car, which she's still paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend uses her car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he uses a full tank and returns it empty, costing $60 each time. He does this three times, and each time she's upset, but he just apologizes and forgets next time. She warned him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. Then, when he wants to go again, she says no, and he gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main issue here is the cost and responsibility. She's the one paying for the car's expenses, including gas, insurance, and maintenance. Her boyfriend is using the car but not contributing to these costs. Using the car for a 3.5-hour round trip three times is significant. Each time he uses a full tank and leaves it empty, costing her $60 each time. That's $180 total, not counting maintenance and insurance. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he's sorry he forgot and promises to do better, but he doesn't follow through. The author gave multiple warnings, which he ignored. Then she decided to take away the privilege of borrowing the car. He reacted angrily, accusing her of being vindictive and holding grudges. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using a shared resource (the car) without contributing to its costs, that's a valid point. The author is covering all expenses, which could be seen as unfair. The boyfriend is not taking responsibility for his part in the situation. The author is trying to enforce boundaries after repeated warnings, which is reasonable. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be the problem. Instead of addressing the valid financial concerns, he's dismissing her and calling her names. That's a red flag for disrespect. The author's decision to revoke the car privilege is a logical consequence after multiple infractions. \n\nSo, the key points are: \n1. The boyfriend is not contributing to the car's costs.\n2. He repeatedly fails to refill the gas tank despite warnings.\n3. The author is trying to set boundaries, which the boyfriend is not respecting.\n4. His reaction is defensive and disrespectful.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author is standing up for her financial boundaries, which is justified. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and his response is inappropriate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
