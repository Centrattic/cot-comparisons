I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow their car anymore. They live together, have been in a relationship for three years. The boyfriend used to have his own car, but sold it when he went back to university. Now, the user has a small car they pay for, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to contribute since it's not his car.\n\nThe problem arises when the boyfriend borrows the car to visit his grandmother, who's 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank but returns it empty, costing the user $60 each time. This has happened three times. The user is upset about the recurring expense and has warned the boyfriend multiple times. The boyfriend apologizes each time but doesn't change his behavior. Now, when the boyfriend wants to take the car again, the user refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user is in the wrong by denying the car use. The user owns the car and is responsible for all costs. The boyfriend is using it without contributing to the expenses. Even though he's in a shared living situation, the car isn't his. The user has set boundaries, and the boyfriend isn't respecting them. The user's decision to stop lending the car is a response to his consistent failure to meet the agreed terms, which is reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is dismissive and disrespectful, which compounds the issue. He's not taking responsibility for his actions, which is a red flag. The user is justified in enforcing their boundaries to protect their financial interests. There's no indication that the user is being unreasonable beyond the car usage; the boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here.\n\nSo, considering all points, the user isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the primary problem, and the user is right to enforce the rules after repeated violations. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, you're not in the wrong).\n"
