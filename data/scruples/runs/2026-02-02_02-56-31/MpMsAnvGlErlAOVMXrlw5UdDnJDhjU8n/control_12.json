I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again. The user is a girlfriend who lives with her boyfriend. He borrowed her car three times to visit his grandma, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time she's upset about the cost, which is $60 per tank. He says he's sorry but forgets next time. She's told him multiple times that if this keeps happening, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Then he wanted to take it again, and she said no. He got mad, called her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The boyfriend is using her car, which he doesn't own, and not paying for the gas. The car is hers, so she's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. Each trip costs her $60. He's aware of this but doesn't contribute. She's given warnings, and now she's taking away the car. He's angry about it.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using your car, it's reasonable to expect them to cover the costs associated with that usage, like gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing, which is causing her financial strain. She's trying to set boundaries, which he's not respecting. When she finally enforces the boundary, he's upset. \n\nBut does she have the right to deny him the car? Since it's her property, she can set the terms for its use. If he's not following the agreed terms (like keeping the tank full), she can revoke the permission. His reaction seems to be the problem here\u2014accusing her of being vindictive when she's actually protecting her own interests.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he felt entitled to use the car without contributing because they live together. But that's not necessarily a valid reason. The car is hers, and he should be responsible for the costs. If he wants to use it, he should either pay for the gas or find another way. She's justified in her stance, especially after multiple warnings. His anger seems misplaced because he was the one not respecting her rules.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's standing up for her own property and financial interests after repeated issues. His behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful, and her response is reasonable.\n"
