I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend repeatedly borrows the girlfriend's car without paying for gas or maintenance, even after being warned. The author decides to stop letting him borrow the car, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities here. The car is the girlfriend's, and she's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend is using the car but not contributing financially. Even though he's not the owner, using someone else's car usually implies some level of responsibility for costs, especially if it's being used regularly. He's taking the car for trips that cost her money each time and not reimbursing her.\n\nThe boyfriend has been told multiple times that his behavior is a problem. Three times he's taken the car and left it empty, costing her money each time. He apologizes but doesn't change his behavior. The author gives warnings but he continues. Then he wants to take the car again, and she says no. He accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is standing up for her own financial interests. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries or taking responsibility for his actions. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary, especially after repeated infractions. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be dismissing her legitimate concerns, which is problematic.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
