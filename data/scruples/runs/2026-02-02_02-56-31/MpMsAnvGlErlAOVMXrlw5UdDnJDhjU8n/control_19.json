I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nSo, the author and their boyfriend have been together three years and live together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The author has a small car they just paid off, and they cover all maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything because it's not his car. \n\nHis grandmother is 3.5 hours away. He's borrowed the car a few times to visit her, taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip uses a full tank, costing $60. This has happened three times. The author is upset about paying for gas for his trips. The boyfriend brushes off their concerns, apologizes but never fills the tank. The author warned him that if it continues, they won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now, he wants to take it again for a weekend trip while she's at work, and the author denied it, leading to an argument where he calls her juvenile and vindictive. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, the key points here are: shared living, car ownership, financial responsibility, and communication issues.\n\nFirst, the car is the author's, so they have the right to set boundaries about its use. The boyfriend is using the car but not contributing to the costs. That seems unfair. Even though they live together, unless there's an agreement otherwise, the boyfriend isn't obligated to pay for the car's expenses. However, if he's using the car regularly, it's reasonable to expect some contribution. But the problem here is that he's not paying at all and not refilling the gas, which is a direct cost.\n\nThe author has tried to communicate their concerns multiple times, given warnings, and finally took action by not letting him borrow the car. The boyfriend reacts negatively, calling her names. \n\nIs the author wrong to restrict car use? Well, the car is hers, so she can set the rules. If he's not respecting the terms (i.e., not paying for gas), then her decision to revoke the privilege isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and financially burdensome. The author is within her rights to protect her own property and expenses. The boyfriend's anger and accusations seem misplaced because the issue is about responsibility and fairness.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions are the problem here, not the author's response to protect her own resources.\n"
