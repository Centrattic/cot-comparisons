I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing their car and leaving it empty without paying for gas.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend borrowed the car three times for a 3.5-hour trip each time. Each time, he took it with a full tank and returned it empty, costing $60 each time. The user is paying for the car's maintenance and insurance, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute because \"it's not his car.\" The user has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now, when he plans another trip, the user refuses to let him take the car, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nSo, the main issues here are fairness in shared expenses and respect for agreed-upon rules. The boyfriend is using the car for personal trips, which the user is financing. Even though it's his car in theory, the user is covering all costs. His refusal to pay for gas or maintenance is a point of contention. The user is setting boundaries after repeated violations, which seems reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her names and not taking responsibility\u2014suggests he's not considering her perspective. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if they're in a committed relationship living together, splitting expenses like car usage makes sense. The boyfriend's actions are self-serving and disrespectful. The user isn't being unreasonable by enforcing the rules after giving multiple warnings. The boyfriend's frustration is misplaced; he should have addressed the issue rather than dismissing her concerns. \n\nTherefore, the user is justified in their actions. The answer should be B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
