I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the boyfriend and the author live together, and he's been borrowing her car to visit his grandma 3.5 hours away. The car is hers, which she just paid off, and she covers all maintenance and insurance. He doesn't pay anything because it's not his car. Each time he borrows it, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. This has happened three times. He says sorry but doesn't fix the behavior. She's warned him multiple times that if this continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Then he tried to take it again for a day trip, and she said no, leading him to accuse her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about fairness in shared living expenses, communication, and boundaries. The car is hers, so she's responsible for all costs. If he's using her car, it's reasonable for him to contribute to the costs, especially when he's using it for personal trips. The fact that he's not paying for gas, even after multiple warnings, is a problem. She's setting a boundary by not allowing him to borrow the car anymore. He's upset and accuses her of being vindictive, but from her perspective, she's standing up for her own financial and emotional boundaries.\n\nHe's not contributing to the car's maintenance or gas, which is fair to expect if he's using it. The cost adds up with three trips at $60 each, totaling $180. She's had enough and is trying to enforce her boundaries. His reaction seems to be about her asserting her rights, which might be frustrating for him, but he's the one not respecting the car ownership and associated costs. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue, and she's taking a stand. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
