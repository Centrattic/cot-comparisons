I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow her car anymore because he keeps using it without refueling and not paying for the maintenance. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, have been in a relationship for three years. The boyfriend sold his car to go to university two years ago. The user has a car that's fully paid off but she's responsible for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend uses her car for visits to his grandmother 3.5 hours away, each time taking it with a full tank but returning it empty. Each trip costs $60 in gas. He's done this three times, and she's been upset each time. He says sorry but doesn't change his behavior. She warned him multiple times, and now she's refusing to let him use the car again. He reacted angrily, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility and respect. She's the one paying for the car's expenses, and he's using it without contributing. Even though the car is hers, when someone uses another person's property, especially for significant expenses like gas, it's reasonable to expect them to cover those costs. He's not doing that, which is causing her financial strain and frustration.\n\nHe's dismissed her concerns each time, saying he'll remember next time but doesn't. That shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and the financial impact. She's communicated her boundaries clearly, and after repeated issues, she's enforcing them. His reaction of anger and accusing her of holding grudges seems like he's not taking her feelings seriously and is being defensive.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, she has a right to set boundaries regarding her car usage. He's not respecting her property, and she's justified in cutting off access after multiple violations. His response indicates a lack of respect for her decisions and her financial situation. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong here. She's standing up for her rights and her financial interests, which is reasonable in this context.\n"
