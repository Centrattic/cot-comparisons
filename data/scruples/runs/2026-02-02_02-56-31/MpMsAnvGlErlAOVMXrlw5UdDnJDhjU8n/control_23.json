I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The setup is that the author's boyfriend keeps borrowing her car to visit his grandma, but he never refuels it and doesn't contribute to the costs. The author has warned him multiple times, and now when he wants to take another trip, she refuses, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of both sides. The boyfriend is using her car, which he's not paying for, and the maintenance, insurance, and gas are all on her. He's taken the car three times for his grandma, each time draining the gas, which costs $60 each time. The author is justifiably upset because she's covering these expenses without any contribution from him. The boyfriend's response to her refusal is to accuse her of being vindictive and holding grudges, which seems like a deflection.\n\nThe car isn't his, so he's not obligated to pay for it, but by borrowing it, he's using a resource that costs the author money. It's reasonable for her to expect him to cover the gas costs, especially since the car is used for his personal errands. His refusal to pay or refill the tank shows a lack of consideration for her financial burden. The author's decision to revoke his borrowing privileges after repeated warnings is a logical step to protect her own interests. The boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate and dismissive, which doesn't help the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's setting a boundary after his repeated failures to respect her property and financial contributions. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
