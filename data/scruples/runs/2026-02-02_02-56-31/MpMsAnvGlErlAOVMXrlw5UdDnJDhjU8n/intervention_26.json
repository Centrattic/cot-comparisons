I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma after he repeatedly borrowed their car without refilling the gas. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend has borrowed the car three times to visit his grandma, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip costs $60 for gas. The user is paying for both the car's maintenance and insurance, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. They've warned him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting to refill the gas and doesn't offer to pay. Now, after the third time, the user refuses to let him borrow the car again, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses them of being vindictive.\n\nSo, key points: The user owns the car, all expenses are their responsibility. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, despite it being a shared resource when borrowed. The user set a boundary after repeated issues, and the boyfriend is upset, calling them names. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user's actions are enforcing boundaries due to repeated neglect from the boyfriend. The boyfriend is responsible for the gas each time he borrows the car, but he hasn't. The user's response is to stop allowing the car to be borrowed, which is a reasonable consequence after multiple warnings. The boyfriend's reaction is defensive and dismissive, not taking responsibility. \n\nIn relationships, fairness matters. Since the user is covering all costs and the boyfriend isn't, the user has the right to set terms. The boyfriend's refusal to comply with the agreed-upon responsibility leads to the user revoking the privilege. The boyfriend's anger and accusations don't justify his behavior. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their own resources and setting clear boundaries after the other person failed to meet agreed terms. The boyfriend's actions (not paying for gas despite warnings) are the issue here.\n"
