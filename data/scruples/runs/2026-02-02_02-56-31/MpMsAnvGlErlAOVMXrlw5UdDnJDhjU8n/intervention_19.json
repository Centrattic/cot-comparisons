  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend has been borrowing the car multiple times to visit his grandma and others, each time taking it full and returning it empty, costing the user $60 each time. The user has warned him several times, but he ignores the warnings. Now, when he asks again, she says no, and he gets upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The user is clearly frustrated because she's paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and gas, while the boyfriend isn't contributing. The boyfriend is using her car frequently without contributing to the costs, which is unfair. The user is setting a boundary by not allowing him to borrow the car anymore after repeated offenses. The boyfriend's reaction seems overly defensive and dismissive of her concerns.\n\nLegally, if the car is hers, she has the right to decide who uses it. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute to gas costs when using her car is a problem because he's not taking responsibility. The user has given warnings, which he ignored, so cutting off the privilege makes sense. His response accusing her of being vindictive is immature, as he's the one not respecting her boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The user tried to communicate her needs, and he didn't respect them. She's standing up for her own financial well-being, which is valid. The boyfriend's behavior is entitled, expecting to use her car without contributing. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
