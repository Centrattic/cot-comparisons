I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living together. The boyfriend is borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, but he's not refilling the gas each time. The girlfriend is upset because she's paying for the car, maintenance, insurance, and gas, and he refuses to contribute. After multiple warnings, she decides to cut him off from using the car, which leads to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the girlfriend, the author, is in the wrong. The main points are: the car is hers, he's using it without contributing, and she's now restricting access. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone is using a shared resource (like a car) but isn't contributing to its costs, that's an issue. The boyfriend isn't paying for gas or maintenance, which are her expenses. She's been clear about her expectations, and he's not following through. So when she decides to stop allowing him to use the car, is that justified?\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be that she's being unreasonable, but given that he's not respecting her boundaries, her action makes sense. She's trying to protect her own financial interests and set limits. \n\nI think the key here is whether the car is truly hers and if they have an agreement. Since the car is hers, she's within her rights to set the terms of its use. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute and repeated neglect of her requests could be seen as disrespectful, so her response is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
