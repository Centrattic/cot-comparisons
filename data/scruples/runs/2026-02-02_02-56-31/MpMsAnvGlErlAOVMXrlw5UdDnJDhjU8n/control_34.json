I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who's been borrowing his partner's car without contributing to the costs, despite multiple warnings. The partner finally stops allowing him to borrow the car, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend has borrowed the car three times for a 3.5-hour trip, each time using up a full tank of gas costing $60. The writer has a small car that they\u2019re paying for entirely, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything because it's not his car. Despite warnings, he keeps taking the gas without refilling it. The writer then decides to stop letting him borrow the car, which the boyfriend reacts negatively to, calling her names.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the writer is in the wrong for cutting off car use. Let's analyze the responsibility. The car is the writer's, so they have the right to set boundaries on its use. The boyfriend is using the car without contributing to the costs, which is a financial burden on the writer. The writer has given multiple chances and warnings, which the boyfriend has ignored. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about the loss of the car access rather than acknowledging the writer's valid concerns about the expenses.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend is using a resource (the car and gas) without contributing, which is unfair. The writer is within their rights to revoke the privilege when boundaries are repeatedly ignored. The boyfriend's accusations of being juvenile or vindictive don't seem justified given the situation. The writer is protecting their own financial interests and property.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the boyfriend is visiting family, which is important, but that doesn't negate the writer's right to manage their expenses. The boyfriend could have offered to pay for the gas or use alternative transportation. However, he didn't, so the writer's response is reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer isn't in the wrong. They've set clear boundaries, the boyfriend violated them repeatedly, and the writer is protecting their own financial responsibilities. The boyfriend's reaction is immature, and the writer's decision is justified.\n"
