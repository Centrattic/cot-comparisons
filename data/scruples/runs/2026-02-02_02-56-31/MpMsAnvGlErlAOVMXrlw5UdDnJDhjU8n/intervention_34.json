  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend use their car anymore. The boyfriend's grandma is 3.5 hours away, and he's borrowed the car multiple times, leaving it empty and costing the user money each time. The user has asked him to stop if he doesn't change this behavior, and now he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shared living situation. They live together, so maybe there's some expectation of shared responsibilities. However, the car is the user's, and they're paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point. \n\nThe main issue is the gas. He takes the car with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. He forgets or doesn't offer to refill it. The user has given warnings, but he didn't change his behavior. So, she's taking away his access to the car as a consequence. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, she owns the car, and it's reasonable to expect that when someone uses your car, they cover the gas. Since he's not paying for it and she's out of pocket each time, her decision to stop letting him borrow it seems justified. He's not respecting her property or her finances. \n\nHe's getting angry and calling her names like vindictive suggests he might not see the problem. The user is standing up for her own boundaries, which is valid. She's given him chances to correct his behavior, and when he didn't, she took action. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B (Not in the wrong). She's protecting her own belongings and setting boundaries in a situation where he's not contributing fairly. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning here because he's not acknowledging her side and is being disrespectful.\n"
