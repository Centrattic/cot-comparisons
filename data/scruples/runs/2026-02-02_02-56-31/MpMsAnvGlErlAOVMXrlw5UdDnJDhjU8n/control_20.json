I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend borrowing a car to visit his grandma, but not refilling the gas each time. The author has asked multiple times and even warned that if it continues, he can't borrow the car anymore. Now, when the boyfriend wants to take the car again, the author refuses, and the boyfriend gets angry, calling her names.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the car is the author's, the boyfriend is borrowing it but not paying for gas or maintenance. Each time he uses it, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, which costs the author $60 each time. He has done this three times, and the author has given warnings. Now she's cutting off the car access, but he's upset.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the car is hers, so she has the right to set boundaries. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's expenses, which is a red flag. Gas is a direct cost here. He's using her car without helping with the costs, which is unfair. The author tried to communicate and set boundaries, which is reasonable. When he ignores the warnings and continues, she's acting on her terms to stop the misuse. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be defensive and possibly dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). The boyfriend isn't paying for gas, which is part of the cost of using the car. The author is within her rights to stop letting him use it if he's not respecting the terms. The boyfriend's anger might stem from him not taking the situation seriously. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
