I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing their car and not refilling the gas. They live together, have been for three years. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago, so he relies on her car. She's the one paying for maintenance and insurance, and he refuses to contribute. Each time he borrows the car, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. This has happened three times. She warned him that if it continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now he wants to go on a day trip to see his grandma again, and she said no. He got angry, called her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the situation. The boyfriend is using her car, which she's paying for, and not contributing financially. Gas is a recurring expense, and he's not covering his part. Even though the car is hers, when someone uses another person's car, it's customary to cover fuel costs, especially if they're not covering maintenance or insurance. Since they live together, maybe there's an expectation of shared expenses, but he's refusing to pay anything. \n\nShe's been clear about her boundaries, warned him multiple times, and he's ignored them. His response is to accuse her of being vindictive. That's a red flag. He's not respecting her decisions and is instead lashing out. The fact that she's standing her ground because he's not respecting her financial boundaries suggests she's justified. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and entitled, especially since he's not contributing in any way. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) He's using her car without contributing to its costs. 2) He's not following through on agreements to refill the gas. 3) He's disrespectful when confronted. So, the user isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The boyfriend's actions are the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
