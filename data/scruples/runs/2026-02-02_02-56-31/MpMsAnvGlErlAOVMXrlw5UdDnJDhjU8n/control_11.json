I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living together. The boyfriend has borrowed the author's car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The author is upset about the cost, which is $60 per tank. The boyfriend doesn't pay for gas or maintenance, even though they live together. The author has warned him several times, and now when he asks to borrow the car again, she says no, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is the author's, so she owns it. She's responsible for all costs. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially to the car, which the author is paying for. He's using the vehicle for his purposes, which is a significant expense each time. Even if the trips are to visit family, using someone else's car should involve some shared responsibility, especially when it's being used repeatedly.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is consistent: he takes the car with a full tank, returns it empty, and doesn't pay for the gas. He's aware of the author's irritation but continues the behavior, promising to do better but not following through. This pattern shows a lack of consideration for her financial burden. The author's response is to stop allowing him to borrow the car, which seems like a reasonable action given his failure to comply with her expectations.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to accuse her of being juvenile and holding grudges, which seems dismissive of her legitimate concerns. The author isn't taking away his car without cause; she's responding to repeated failures to respect her property and financial responsibilities. The key points here are ownership, shared responsibilities in a relationship, and the boyfriend's repeated disregard for her boundaries.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are justified. She's standing up for her own property and financial autonomy. The boyfriend isn't respecting her rules, which the author has clearly communicated. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
