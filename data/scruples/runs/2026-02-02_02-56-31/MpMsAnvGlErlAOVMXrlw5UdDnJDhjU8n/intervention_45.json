I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma. The situation is that her boyfriend keeps borrowing her car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. He's done this three times, and she's been upset about it. He says sorry but doesn't change his behavior. She's told him he can't borrow the car anymore, and he got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the boyfriend not paying for gas or maintenance. The car is hers, and he's using it without contributing. She's given multiple warnings, and he hasn't complied. Then she decides to stop letting him borrow the car, which he's upset about.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using a resource that you own and paying nothing for it, that's a problem. She's maintaining the car and paying all the costs. He's using it for his family visits, which is understandable, but he's not contributing. The fact that he says it's not his car and refuses to pay might be a point against him. \n\nShe's tried to communicate and set boundaries, but he's not respecting them. The final straw was when he wanted to take the car again, and she denied him. He reacted negatively, which seems to be his issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, when someone borrows something, especially something costly like a car, there's an implied responsibility to be considerate of the owner's costs. Maybe he should have offered to pay for gas each time. Since he didn't, her decision to stop him seems justified. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's living with her and they've been together three years might imply some shared responsibilities, but the car is hers, so she's not obligated to let him use it. His reaction could stem from feeling that his needs are being ignored, but he's not meeting her needs by not contributing to the costs.\n\nSo, putting it all together, she's not in the wrong. She's standing up for her own financial interests and setting boundaries after repeated issues. He's the one not respecting those boundaries and not taking responsibility. The answer should be B.\n"
