  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma using their car because he never refills the gas. The boyfriend is using their car three times for a 3.5-hour trip each time, which costs $60 in gas each. He promises to remember to refill it but doesn't, and the user is now cutting off access to the car.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the repeated failure to refill the gas. The boyfriend is using a car he doesn't own, and the maintenance and insurance are entirely the user's responsibility. The user has given warnings, and the boyfriend's response was to dismiss their concerns as vindictive. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using your resources repeatedly and not contributing, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The boyfriend isn't paying for gas or maintenance, which adds to the user's financial burden. The user's decision to stop allowing him to use the car is a logical consequence after multiple warnings. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about the inconvenience rather than acknowledging the user's legitimate concerns. \n\nThe user isn't being unreasonable. They've given multiple chances, and the boyfriend's behavior hasn't changed. The user's actions are about enforcing respect for their property and finances. The boyfriend's criticism of the user as juvenile suggests he's unwilling to take responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The user isn't in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries when someone else is using their resources without contributing or respecting those resources.\n"
