I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend living together for three years. The boyfriend has been borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. The girlfriend has a small car she just paid off, and she's responsible for all the maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything because \"it's not his car.\" He borrows the car, takes it with a full tank, and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. This has happened three times, and he always forgets to refill the gas or offer to pay. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times that if this continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. When he asks again, she says no, and he yells at her, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who is in the wrong here. The boyfriend is using the girlfriend's car for his own purposes (visiting family) without contributing to the costs. The car is hers, so she's responsible for all expenses. The boyfriend's argument that it's not his car doesn't absolve him from the responsibility when he's using it. If he borrows something, he should respect the owner's wishes and contribute if necessary. The girlfriend has given multiple warnings, which he's ignored. When she follows through on her threat to stop letting him use the car, he reacts angrily, which is not acceptable.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful. He's using her resources without contributing, and when confronted, he attacks her character instead of addressing the issue. The girlfriend is protecting her own property and setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's outburst is a red flag, indicating poor conflict resolution skills.\n\nSo, the author (the girlfriend) is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her own financial interests and property. The boyfriend is the one at fault for his repeated disregard of her wishes and his disrespectful response.\n"
