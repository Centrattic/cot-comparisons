I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is about the boyfriend borrowing the car to visit his grandma and not refilling the gas each time. The car belongs to the author, and she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the car costs since he's not the owner, which is a point of contention.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has borrowed the car three times for visits that require a full tank each way. He takes it full and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. She's asked him to remember to refill it but he keeps forgetting and doesn't offer to pay. She warned him that if this continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Then, when he asked again, she said no, and he got upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's break it down. The car is hers, so she has the right to set rules about its use. The boyfriend is using a resource he doesn't own and contributing nothing to its upkeep. Not paying for gas is a financial burden on her. She's given him multiple chances to fix his behavior with warnings. When he doesn't comply, she's removing the privilege. That seems reasonable. His response of blowing up at her for standing up for her own property might indicate he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a lack of communication. Did she clearly state her expectations from the start? She mentioned he \"refuses\" to pay, so maybe he's aware. However, the repeated forgetfulness and lack of accountability on his part are key here. She's trying to protect her investment, which she's entitled to. \n\nHer response of revoking the car access is a logical consequence after multiple warnings. The boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling his needs are being ignored, but he's also not considering hers. The core issue is responsibility and respect for her property. Since the car is hers, the author isn't wrong in enforcing the rules. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
