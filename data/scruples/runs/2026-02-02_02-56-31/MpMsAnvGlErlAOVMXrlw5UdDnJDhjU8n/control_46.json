I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend living together. The boyfriend uses the author's car to visit his grandma, but each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty without paying for gas. The author has asked multiple times for him to either pay or fill the tank, but he ignores it. Now, the author has decided to stop letting him borrow the car, which leads to an argument where he calls her names.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The key points here are ownership of the car, shared responsibility, and the boyfriend's behavior. The car is the author's, which she's paying for, including maintenance and insurance. Even though they live together, the car isn't his, so he's using her asset without contributing. The cost of gas each time is $60, and he's done this multiple times without reimbursement. The author has given warnings, and now she's cutting off access because he hasn't changed his behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to accuse her of being juvenile and holding grudges, but the author is responding to his repeated irresponsibility. From a fairness standpoint, if someone uses another person's resources, especially at a cost, they should contribute. The boyfriend's refusal to pay or acknowledge the issue is the main problem. The author is setting a boundary after repeated attempts to communicate, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's outburst and name-calling suggest he's not taking responsibility. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting her property and enforcing agreements. The boyfriend is the one misusing the car and not respecting her requests. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
