I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is in a three-year relationship with her boyfriend, and they live together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago, so now they use her car. She's the one covering all the maintenance, insurance, and gas costs because she's the registered owner.\n\nThe main issue is that the boyfriend repeatedly borrows her car to visit his grandmother, who's 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes the car full of gas and returns it empty, costing her $60 each trip. This has happened three times, and she's been upset about it each time. He apologizes but never fills up the tank again. She's warned him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. Now he's asked to borrow it again, and she said no, leading to an argument where he accused her of being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. Since the car isn't his, he's not contributing to the costs. It's reasonable for her to expect that if he borrows the car, especially for long trips, he should cover the associated costs. Gas is a direct expense, and if he uses the car for his personal errands, he should compensate her. His refusal to do so seems unfair, especially since he's made it clear that he's aware of this and promises to fix it but doesn't.\n\nNext, the communication. She's given multiple warnings. That shows she's tried to address the issue directly. His response, when confronted, was to accuse her of holding grudges and being vindictive, which doesn't address the actual problem. This suggests a lack of accountability on his part. Her decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a reasonable consequence for his repeated behavior.\n\nThe concept of fairness in shared responsibilities is key here. Even though they live together, the car is hers, so the costs are hers. If he uses it, he should bear the associated costs. His actions are using her resources without contributing, which is unfair. Her standing by her decision to revoke the privilege is a justified self-defense of her own property and expenses.\n\nPotential counterarguments might be that he's trying to visit family, which is important. However, that doesn't justify not covering the costs. If he truly wanted to visit his grandma, he could either pay for the gas himself or find another way to get there. His repeated failure to follow through on promises to compensate her makes her decision to cut off access reasonable.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional response. He's upset and called her names, which indicates he's not taking her feelings seriously. His behavior suggests a pattern of disrespect towards her financial boundaries. Her boundary is valid because she's the one shouldering all the costs without any contribution from him, especially when he's using the car for his own purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, the user is justified in her actions. She's communicated her concerns, set clear boundaries, and followed through when those boundaries were repeatedly violated. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and unfair, making her response appropriate.\n"
