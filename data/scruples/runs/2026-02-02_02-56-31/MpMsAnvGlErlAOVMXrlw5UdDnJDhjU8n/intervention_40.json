I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma because he doesn't pay for gas when using her car. They've lived together for three years, and he sold his car when returning to university two years ago. The main issue is that he borrows her car, uses all the gas, and never refills it or pays for the maintenance. She's asked him several times to stop, and he's now upset, calling her juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the situation. The boyfriend is using her car, which she owns and pays for. Each time he takes it, he uses a full tank of gas costing $60 and doesn't refill it. That seems like a problem because if he's using a resource she's responsible for, he should contribute to the costs. The fact that he's been told multiple times and still doesn't change his behavior suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously.\n\nThe user's response was to revoke his privilege to use the car, which is a logical consequence if he's using it without contributing. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014getting angry and blaming her\u2014might indicate a lack of empathy or a pattern of dismissing her feelings. In a relationship, especially a long-term one where they live together, mutual respect and sharing responsibilities are important. If he's not respecting her boundaries or contributing to shared expenses, that's a red flag.\n\nSome might argue that he's just borrowing the car and doesn't have a financial obligation, but if the borrowing leads to recurring costs, the person using it should help cover those. The user isn't being vindictive; she's setting a boundary to protect her resources. The boyfriend's refusal to acknowledge the issue and his harsh words could imply that he is in the wrong for not respecting her and for the repeated behavior despite warnings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps he didn't realize the car's gas usage was a problem, or maybe he has a different view on shared expenses. But given that the user has communicated her stance multiple times and he still doesn't comply, it's unlikely he was unaware. The key here is that the user is trying to address a fair concern, and the boyfriend is reacting negatively without addressing the actual issue. So, the user isn't in the wrong for enforcing her boundary.\n"
