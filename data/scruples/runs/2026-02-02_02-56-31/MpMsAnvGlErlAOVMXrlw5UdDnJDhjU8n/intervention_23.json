  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing their boyfriend to borrow their car after he consistently didn't refill the gas. So, the boyfriend uses the car for visits to his grandma, which is a 3.5-hour trip. Each time he takes the car, he leaves it full and returns it empty, costing $60 each time. The user has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now, when he wants to take the car again, the user says no, and he's upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The user is paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing, even though he benefits by using the car. It's not his car, but he's using it without covering the costs. That seems unfair. The user has a right to be upset about the expenses stacking up, especially since the car is in her name and she's responsible for it.\n\nNext, the boyfriend's behavior. He keeps borrowing the car, promising to refill the gas but doesn't follow through. Each time, he says he'll remember next time, but he doesn't. The user has given multiple warnings, which shows she's tried to resolve the issue before escalating. His reaction to her finally setting a boundary is aggressive and dismissive, labeling her negatively. That's a red flag for his maturity in handling the situation.\n\nThe user's decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a consequence for his repeated failures to comply. She's trying to protect her own resources and set boundaries, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's anger and accusations suggest he's not respecting her boundaries and is instead focusing on his own needs without considering hers.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the user isn't in the wrong. She's owning the car, managing all costs, and her boyfriend is using it without contributing. His behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful. The user's actions are justified as self-preservation. The boyfriend's response is immature, as he's not taking accountability and is attacking her instead.\n"
