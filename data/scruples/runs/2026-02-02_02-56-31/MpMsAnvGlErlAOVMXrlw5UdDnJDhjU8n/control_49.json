I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend not paying for gas when he borrows her car. The main issue is whether the author is justified in not letting her boyfriend use her car anymore after multiple instances of him not refilling the gas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The boyfriend uses the car for visits to his grandma, which are 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing $60 each time. This has happened three times. The author has asked him multiple times to refill the tank or contribute to gas costs, but he ignores it, apologizing but not correcting his behavior. The author then decides to stop letting him borrow the car, leading to a conflict.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's reasonable for the owner of the car to expect that the borrower covers the costs incurred, especially when the usage is significant and repeated. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute financially and his dismissive attitude (\"he's sorry he forgot\") suggest a lack of consideration for the author's financial burden. The author's warnings and subsequent decision to revoke borrowing rights seem like a logical step to enforce accountability. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her names and dismissing her concerns\u2014indicates he doesn't see the issue as valid, which might not be justified given the circumstances.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the boyfriend is using the car for family visits, which could be seen as important. But since the car is the author's and she's paying for all maintenance, insurance, and gas, the financial responsibility should lie with him when he borrows it. The repeated failure to uphold this responsibility after warnings makes the author's decision understandable. The boyfriend's entitlement to use the car without contributing is problematic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect her own interests. The boyfriend's actions have been inconsiderate, and her response is a reasonable consequence. The key points are the repeated violations of her expectations and his lack of willingness to address them, leading to her taking action to prevent further unfairness.\n"
