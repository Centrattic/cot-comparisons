I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. So, the boyfriend is using the author's car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. The car was sold by the boyfriend when he went back to university; the author has her own car, which she pays for. The problem is that each time he borrows the car, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. He's done this three times, and even after warnings, he doesn't remember to refill the gas or offer to pay. Now, when he asks to take the car again, the author refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness here. The boyfriend is using a car he doesn't own, so he's using someone else's property. The author is the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. When he borrows the car, he's essentially using her resources without contributing. Even though he might be returning the car on time, the issue is the cost of gas. Each trip uses up all the gas, which she has to replace. He's not offering to pay for that, despite being asked. The author has given multiple warnings, and he's still not changing his behavior. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if you borrow someone's car, you should cover the expenses related to that use. This includes gas because you're using their fuel. The boyfriend's refusal to pay is a problem. The author is setting a boundary by refusing to let him use the car anymore because he's not respecting her ownership and financial responsibilities. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems unfair. He's calling her names like \"juvenile\" and \"vindictive,\" which might indicate he's not taking her feelings or the financial aspect into account. If someone is using your property without contributing, it's reasonable to set limits. The author isn't being unreasonable by stopping the car borrowing after repeated issues. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the boyfriend could have found another way to visit his grandma, like using public transport or a different vehicle. But the problem is he's relying on her car and not considering her costs. The author isn't wrong for standing up for her own resources. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's protecting her property and financial interests. The boyfriend is using her car without compensating her, despite being warned. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
