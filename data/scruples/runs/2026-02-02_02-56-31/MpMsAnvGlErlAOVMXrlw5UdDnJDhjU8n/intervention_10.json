  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow her car anymore because he keeps draining the gas and not paying for it. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend borrowed the car three times to visit his grandma, each time starting with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip is 3.5 hours away, and a full tank costs $60. The user is upset about the gas costs since the car is hers, and he refuses to contribute. She's tried warning him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting or not offering to pay. Now he wants to take the car again, and she's denied it. He's angry, calling her names like vindictive.\n\nSo, the main points here are ownership of the car and responsibility for expenses. The car is hers, so she's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. He's using it without contributing, which she's not comfortable with. She's given him chances to correct his behavior, but he hasn't followed through. Her response is to stop allowing him to borrow the car. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, from a fairness standpoint, if he's using her car and resources, it's reasonable to expect him to contribute to the costs. By not paying for the gas he's using, he's being unfair. The user is setting boundaries based on his consistent failure to respect her rules. He's dismissing her concerns as holding a grudge, but the issue is ongoing and not just about past events. \n\nHer actions are a direct response to his irresponsibility. She's communicated her expectations, and he's ignored them. So, she's justified in revoking the privilege. He should have either filled up the gas or paid for it. Since he didn't, her decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's protecting her property and standing up for her boundaries. His reaction is inappropriate, as he's the one violating agreed-upon rules.\n"
