  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma because he uses her car without refilling the gas. So, the situation is that they live together, he sold his car when he went back to university. She has a car she pays for, including maintenance and insurance. He borrows it, uses up the gas each time, and doesn't refill it. She's been upset about this and warned him, but he keeps doing it. Now he wants to take it again, and she says no, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness here. She's the one paying for the car's expenses, including gas. If he uses it, it's reasonable that he should cover the costs. He's not contributing financially, which might be a big issue. The fact that he keeps using the car and not refilling the gas despite warnings shows a pattern of behavior. She's trying to set boundaries, which is understandable. When someone repeatedly ignores your requests and then gets upset when you enforce a rule, that's on them. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend is using emotional manipulation by calling her names like juvenile and vindictive. That's a red flag. She's standing up for her own needs, which is important in any relationship. The fact that he's using her car without contributing to the costs is unfair. She's not in the wrong for setting a boundary. So, the answer should be B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
