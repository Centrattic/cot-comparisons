I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nThe user (AITA) is in a three-year relationship with their boyfriend, and they live together. The boyfriend used to have his own car but sold it when he went back to university two years ago. Now, the user has a small car, which they just paid off. They're responsible for all the maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend borrows the car to visit his grandmother, who's 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes the car with a full tank and returns it empty. The user is upset because the gas costs them $60 per trip, and this has happened three times. The boyfriend apologizes each time but doesn't remember to refuel or pay for the gas. The user has warned him multiple times that if this continues, they won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now, the boyfriend wants to take the car for another trip, and the user refuses. He gets angry, calling them juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo the question is, is the user in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the user owns the car and is paying for all expenses. The boyfriend is using their car without contributing financially. Even though the car isn't his, he's using it, which should require some form of contribution. The user is setting boundaries by refusing to let him borrow the car if he doesn't pay for the gas. The boyfriend's behavior seems to be disrespectful of the user's property and financial responsibilities. The user is trying to enforce their rules after multiple warnings, which seems reasonable. The boyfriend is not taking responsibility and is now upset about the user standing up for themselves. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the user is right to want their expenses covered. The boyfriend isn't contributing, which is unfair. The user is within their rights to set consequences for not following the agreed terms. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and dismissive of the user's valid concerns. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground? The user could have discussed splitting the gas cost or some arrangement beforehand, but the boyfriend didn't offer. The user is also trying to protect their own interests by not allowing the car to be used without proper compensation. \n\nIn terms of fault, the boyfriend is the one repeatedly violating the agreed-upon terms (like returning the car with a full tank) and not taking responsibility. The user is enforcing their boundaries, which is necessary. The boyfriend's anger stems from not respecting those boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their car and the associated costs. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here.\n"
