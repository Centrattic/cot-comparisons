  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So the main issue is that the boyfriend is borrowing the car to visit his grandma and other things but never fills up the gas and doesn't pay for the car maintenance or insurance. The user has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now he wants to take the car again, but the user won't let him. He's upset and accusing her of being vengeful.\n\nFirst, I need to see if her actions are justified. The car is hers, and she's paying for it. If someone borrows your property and doesn't take care of the expenses, that's unfair. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs, which is a problem. Each time he takes the car, he uses up the gas and doesn't replace it. The cost adds up, especially with three trips already. The user is within her rights to set boundaries since it's her car. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He's brushing off her concerns, not following through on his apologies, and now he's upset when she removes the privilege. His behavior seems dismissive and disrespectful. The user is trying to communicate her needs, which is reasonable in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user tried to warn him multiple times, so she's made her expectations clear. If he continues to ignore those, then she's justified in taking action. The boyfriend's accusations of being juvenile or vindictive might be a way to deflect from his own wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the fact that he sold his car and relies on her car but refuses to contribute financially makes it more about fairness. She's not obligated to let him use her car without any contribution. So, she's not in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions and the lack of his contribution are the main issues. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
