I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and girlfriend live together. They've been in a three-year relationship. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The girlfriend has a car she just paid off, but she still pays for maintenance and insurance. The problem is that the boyfriend borrows her car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank, returns it empty, and the tank costs $60. This has happened three times. The girlfriend is upset because she's paying for the car and gas, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute, saying it's not his car. She's given warnings, but he keeps forgetting to refill the gas. Now, when he wants to take another trip, she refuses because of his previous behavior, and he accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nSo the main issues here are about fairness in shared expenses in a relationship and responsibilities when borrowing a car. The girlfriend is upset because she's not only maintaining the car but also covering the gas costs for trips that are for the boyfriend's family. The boyfriend doesn't contribute financially and dismisses her concerns, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual respect and consideration. Even though the car is hers, sharing it with a partner who uses it frequently for personal trips should involve some compromise. However, the boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas or maintenance, despite being asked, seems unfair. Gas costs are a direct expense tied to the usage, and if he's the one using the car, it's reasonable for him to cover that. The girlfriend's frustration is justified because she's shouldering all the costs for his personal trips.\n\nWhen she sets boundaries by not letting him borrow the car anymore, he reacts negatively, calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges. His behavior of ignoring her warnings and not taking responsibility for the gas is the root of the problem. The girlfriend is acting to protect her own interests and set clear expectations, which is reasonable in any relationship. The boyfriend's entitlement to the car without contributing is the issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the girlfriend isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself and addressing a legitimate concern. The boyfriend's actions are the problem, not hers. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
