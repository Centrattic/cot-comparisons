I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is presented in a \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) style, so I need to analyze the scenario from both perspectives.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is living with the author, but he sold his car when he went to university. The author has a car she pays for entirely, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend borrows the car to visit his grandma, 3.5 hours away, and each time he takes it with a full tank but returns it empty. The cost of a tank is $60, and this has happened three times. The author is upset because she's covering these costs, and he doesn't contribute. She's warned him multiple times that if this continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he tries to take it again, she revokes the privilege, and he reacts angrily.\n\nNow, I need to assess if she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and respect. The boyfriend is using a car that isn't his, which the author is solely responsible for. By taking the car and using all the gas, he's incurring costs that he isn't paying for. The author has tried to communicate her concerns and set boundaries, but he hasn't followed through. His reaction of anger and accusations (calling her names like juvenile and vindictive) seems dismissive of her legitimate concerns.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone is using another person's resources repeatedly without contributing to the costs, that's a problem. The author has the right to set boundaries regarding her property. The boyfriend's refusal to acknowledge the issue or compensate her could be seen as disrespectful. Additionally, his reaction to her enforcing those boundaries might indicate a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of mutual respect in a relationship. The boyfriend might feel that the author isn't considering his need to visit family, which is important. But if he's been warned multiple times and still doesn't comply, the author has a right to enforce consequences. The boyfriend's anger seems out of proportion if he was truly trying to be considerate but made a mistake. His behavior suggests a pattern of not taking responsibility, which is on him.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is justified in her actions. She's standing up for her financial interests and has communicated her expectations. The boyfriend's actions and reaction are where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
