  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend use their car anymore. The boyfriend uses the car to visit his grandma, but each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the user around $60 each time. This has happened three times, and the user has warned him multiple times. Now, when he wants to take the car again, she refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The user is paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of contention. Using the car for visits that cost money without contributing could be seen as unfair. The boyfriend's actions are leading to repeated expenses for the user. Even though he's apologized each time, he hasn't changed his behavior, so the user is trying to set a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend feels that visiting his grandma is important and he's frustrated with the restrictions. But the user has given warnings and the boyfriend didn't take them seriously. The user is trying to protect her own financial interests. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about the user enforcing the rules, not about past issues as he accuses.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Probably not. She's standing up for her own resources and setting boundaries after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior is the main problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, you're not in the wrong).\n"
