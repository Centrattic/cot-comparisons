  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow their car after he repeatedly didn't return it with a full tank. They've been together three years, live together, and he refuses to pay for gas or maintenance. The car was bought by the user, who's still paying for it. The boyfriend has taken the car multiple times, using up the gas each time, and the user has warned him several times. Now he's asking to go visit his grandma again, and the user said no. The boyfriend reacted angrily, calling the user vindictive. The user wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the car belongs to the user, so they have the right to set boundaries. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs, which is a key point. Using the car without refilling gas is a repeated issue. The user gave warnings, which he ignored. The boyfriend's anger and accusations seem to be about the user prioritizing fairness and financial responsibility. Since the car is the user's, they can decide who borrows it. The boyfriend's behavior shows disrespect for the user's property and their financial situation. The user isn't in the wrong for protecting their asset and enforcing rules after repeated violations. So the answer is B (No).\n"
