  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend use their car after he repeatedly borrows it without refilling the gas or contributing to costs. \n\nFirst, the car is hers, and she's the one paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything towards it, even though he uses it. He's taken the car multiple times to visit his grandma, each time using a full tank and returning it empty, costing $60 each time. She's warned him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he asked again, she said no, and he got upset, calling her names.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, she's the one bearing all costs. He's using the car but not contributing, which seems unfair. She's setting boundaries because he's not respecting her property. His reaction suggests he doesn't see the issue, which is a red flag. Trust and respect are important in a relationship, and he's not respecting her financial contributions. \n\nShe's not being vindictive; she's standing up for herself after repeated issues. The boyfriend's frustration is misplaced because he's the one violating the agreed-upon rules. So, she's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
