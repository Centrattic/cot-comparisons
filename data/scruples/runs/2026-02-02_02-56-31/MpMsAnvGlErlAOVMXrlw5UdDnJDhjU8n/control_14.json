I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend is borrowing her car to visit his grandmother, which is a 3.5-hour drive away. Each time he takes the car, he uses all the gas and doesn't refill it, costing the author $60 each time. He's done this three times, and the author has told him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now he wants to take it again, and she said no, leading to him getting angry and accusing her of being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. The car is the author's, and she's paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend sold his own car when he went back to university, so he doesn't have a vehicle anymore. That's important because he's relying on her car, which he's not contributing to financially.\n\nThe main issue is that he uses her car but doesn't put gas back in it. Even though he says he's sorry and promises to remember, he doesn't follow through. This seems like a repeated problem where he's not respecting her property or her financial commitments. She's given multiple warnings, so she's tried to communicate her expectations. When he continues to ignore those warnings, she decides to revoke his permission to use the car. His reaction is to accuse her of being vindictive and holding grudges.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is paying for the car, including gas, insurance, and maintenance. If he's using the car extensively, especially for long trips, it's reasonable for him to contribute to the costs. The fact that he refuses to pay for anything related to the car, even though he uses it, could be seen as him not taking responsibility. The author's decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a logical consequence after multiple breaches of trust regarding the gas.\n\nHis anger seems misplaced. If he's upset about not being able to visit his grandmother, maybe he should consider alternative solutions, like splitting gas costs or carpooling with others. However, since he hasn't done that and instead has been negligent with the gas, the author's stance is justified. She's standing up for her own financial interests and the value of her property.\n\nI don't see any indication that the author is being unreasonable. She's made clear her expectations and followed through after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior of not refilling the gas and not contributing to costs is the problem here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding to stop him from using her car.\n"
