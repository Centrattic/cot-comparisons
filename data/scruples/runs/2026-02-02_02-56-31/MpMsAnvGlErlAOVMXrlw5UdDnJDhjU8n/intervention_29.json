  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing her car and not refilling the gas. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and the user have been together three years and live together. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. She has a car she's paying for, including maintenance and insurance. He refuses to pay because it's not his car.\n\nHe's visited his grandma three times, each trip 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes the car with a full tank and returns it empty. A full tank costs her $60. She's upset about the repeated cost and lack of fairness. He keeps apologizing but doesn't fix the behavior. She's warned him multiple times that if he continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car.\n\nThen, he wanted to take the car again for a weekend trip. She said no, leading to an argument where he accused her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether she's justified in her actions. From a fairness standpoint, she's covering all costs for the car, which he uses but doesn't contribute to. If he's using the car for his personal visits, it's reasonable that he should cover associated costs, like gas. He's not doing that, leading to her frustration. She's given warnings, so when he continues, revoking his access seems logical.\n\nHe might argue that he's borrowing the car and that not paying gas is because it's her car, but if he's using it, contributing to the expenses is fair. His reaction of anger and accusations could be seen as dismissive of her concerns. So, she's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
