I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma. The boyfriend uses her car, which she's paying for, and each time he returns it with an empty tank. She's upset because she's covering the gas costs, and he's not contributing. She's told him multiple times and now is cutting off his access, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of their situation. The car is hers, so she has the right to set the terms for its use. If he's using it, it's reasonable for him to cover the expenses, especially since he's the one benefiting. The fact that he's not paying for gas, even though he's the one using it for trips, seems like an issue of responsibility and fairness. She's maintaining the car and paying for insurance and maintenance, which are significant costs. Gas is an ongoing expense, and having him use it without covering the costs would add up.\n\nHe's been warned multiple times and didn't change his behavior. She's given him chances to correct it, but he keeps forgetting and not offering to refill the tank. That shows a lack of consideration on his part. His reaction to her cutting off access seems disproportionate and dismissive of her valid concerns. Accusing her of being juvenile and holding grudges is a deflection from the actual problem.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility, communication, and fairness. She's acting within her rights as the car owner to set boundaries. His actions are inconsiderate and self-centered. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for enforcing the rules regarding car usage and expenses.\n"
