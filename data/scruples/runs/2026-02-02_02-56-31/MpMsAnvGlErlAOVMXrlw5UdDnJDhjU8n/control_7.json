I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who borrows his girlfriend's car multiple times without paying for gas or maintenance, and when she stops him, he gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend uses the car three times to visit his grandma, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip costs $60 for gas. The author has asked him multiple times to contribute, but he refuses, saying it's not his car. The author then decides to stop letting him borrow the car after he plans another trip, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The car is the author's, so she's responsible for all costs. Her boyfriend isn't contributing despite using the car for his purposes. That seems unfair. He's using her resources without financial responsibility. She's given warnings, and he's ignored them. When she sets a boundary, he reacts poorly, which suggests he doesn't respect her rules.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate. Not just the gas issue, but also not paying for maintenance or insurance. Even if the car isn't his, using someone else's car incurs costs that the user should cover. He's not doing that, leading to resentment.\n\nThe author's response is to stop allowing the car use after repeated infractions. That's a reasonable boundary. His anger and accusations are misplaced because he's the one not respecting her rules. She's standing up for her own financial and emotional limits, which is valid.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
