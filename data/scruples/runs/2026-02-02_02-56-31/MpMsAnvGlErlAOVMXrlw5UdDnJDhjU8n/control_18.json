I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who's borrowing the author's car to visit his grandmother, but not refilling the gas each time, costing the author money each time. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now, when the boyfriend wants to take the car again, the author refuses, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend uses the car three times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Gas costs $60 each time, totaling $180. The author mentions that the car is hers, she pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. She's given multiple warnings, but he doesn't comply. Then she decides to revoke his privilege to use the car, leading to a conflict where he accuses her of being juvenile and vindictive.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is justified in her actions. The boyfriend is using a car he doesn't own and isn't paying for any of the associated costs. Even though he's borrowing it, he's expected to maintain the gas level, especially if he's the one using it. The author is covering all the expenses and has clearly communicated her expectations. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute or remember to refill the gas shows a lack of consideration for her financial burden.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The author made it clear that this behavior was unacceptable. By repeatedly ignoring her warnings, the boyfriend is being disrespectful. The author's decision to stop allowing him to use the car is a logical consequence to protect her own resources. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from not valuing her feelings and the financial aspect, which is problematic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her boundaries and the boyfriend isn't respecting them. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
