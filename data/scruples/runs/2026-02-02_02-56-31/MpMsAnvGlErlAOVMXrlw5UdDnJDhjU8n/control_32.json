I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who keeps borrowing the author's car to visit his grandmother, using up the gas each time without refilling it or contributing to costs. The author has warned him multiple times, and when he ignores the warnings, she decides to stop letting him borrow the car. He reacts angrily, calling her names. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using the author's car without contributing to any costs. The car is the author's, and she's paying for insurance, maintenance, and gas. Each time he borrows it, he uses up a full tank of gas, costing her $60 each time. He's done this three times, and she's given warnings. Despite that, he doesn't refill the tank or offer to pay. \n\nThe author's response is to revoke the privilege of borrowing the car. The boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges. Now, the key points here are about responsibility and fairness. The boyfriend is using a resource that isn't his, without contributing to its upkeep. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially when repeatedly warned. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate. He's not respecting her property or her financial contributions. The author is standing up for her own interests, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about defensiveness rather than acknowledging the issue. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't wrong for setting limits. She's made clear her expectations, and he didn't meet them. Her decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a logical consequence. The boyfriend's anger stems from his own actions, not the author's overreaction. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's managing her own resources and addressing a repeated problem. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's response. Therefore, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
