I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend living together for three years. The boyfriend uses her car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he leaves it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing around $60 in gas each trip. This has happened three times, and he never pays for the gas or offers to refill the tank. The author has warned him multiple times that if he continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. When he asks to go on a weekend trip, she refuses, and he accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness here. The car is hers, and she's covering all costs including maintenance, insurance, and gas. He's using her resources without contributing, which seems unfair. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility for the gas expenses despite being asked. The author is trying to set boundaries after repeated warnings, which is a reasonable action when someone isn't respecting your limits.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a point to consider. He's using emotional abuse with accusations of being vindictive and holding grudges when she's actually enforcing a boundary. That's a red flag. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting her belongings and financial responsibilities. She's not being unreasonable; she's been clear about the rules and the consequences. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here\u2014using without contributing and then reacting poorly when boundaries are set.\n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. She's acting within her rights to manage her property and finances, while the boyfriend is not respecting her terms and is being dismissive of her concerns.\n"
