  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow their car anymore. The boyfriend has used the car several times to visit his grandmother, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing the user $60 each time. The user has warned him multiple times, but he hasn't paid for the gas or offered to help with maintenance or insurance. Now, when he wants to take the car again, she refuses, and he's upset, calling her names like vindictive.\n\nFirst, the car is hers, so she's within her rights to set the terms for borrowing it. He's using her resources without contributing, which isn't fair. Even if he's family, she's not obligated to cover the costs. The boyfriend's argument that it's not his car is valid, but that's exactly why he should be responsible for the gas he uses. He's been warned multiple times but hasn't changed his behavior, so her decision to stop lending the car makes sense. His reaction seems to be more about the inconvenience than accountability, which isn't reasonable. So, she's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
