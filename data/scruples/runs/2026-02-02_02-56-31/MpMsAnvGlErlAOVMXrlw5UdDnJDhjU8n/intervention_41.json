  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow her car after he kept using it without refilling the gas. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's grandmother is 3.5 hours away, and he's been visiting her a few times. Each time, he takes the car with a full tank and returns it empty. The cost is $60 each time, and this has happened three times. The user is paying for the maintenance, insurance, and gas, but the boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car. She's told him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Then, when he asks to use it again, she says no, and he gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the main issue is about fairness and responsibility. The user is paying for the car and gas, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. Even though he's borrowing it, he's not covering the costs. The user is setting a boundary by not letting him borrow the car anymore because he's not respecting her financial contributions. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be defensive and dismissive, not taking responsibility.\n\nFrom what I can see, the user isn't in the wrong. She's communicated her concerns and given him chances to correct his behavior, but he hasn't. She's standing up for her own financial boundaries. The boyfriend is the one who isn't respecting her wishes and not taking accountability. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
