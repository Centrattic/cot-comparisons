I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who borrowed the author's car multiple times to visit his grandmother and didn't refill the gas each time, costing the author money. The author finally decided to stop letting him borrow the car, but the boyfriend reacted negatively, leading the author to question if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend has borrowed the car three times for a 3.5-hour trip, each time using a full tank and returning it empty. The author has mentioned the cost of gas each time, which is $60. The boyfriend has apologized but didn't follow through, and the author warned him multiple times. Finally, the author revoked his permission, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accused her of being juvenile.\n\nNow, considering the responsibilities here. The car is the author's, and she's covering all costs, including maintenance, insurance, and now gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of contention. When he borrows the car, he's using it for personal trips, which should logically involve some form of reimbursement or at least returning it with a full tank. Failing to do so repeatedly without making amends could be seen as inconsiderate or irresponsible.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He's defensive, not taking accountability, and dismissing her concerns as grudges. This suggests he's not acknowledging her valid financial concerns. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a reasonable response to protect her own interests, especially after repeated warnings and no change in behavior.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the boyfriend didn't intend to cause harm and thought he would remember to refill the gas. However, the repeated instances and lack of follow-through negate that. The cost isn't insignificant either\u2014$60 three times is $180, which adds up. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting a boundary after clear violations.\n\nAnother angle is the shared living situation. If they live together, maybe there's an unspoken agreement about shared expenses. But since the boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's costs beyond borrowing it, that complicates things. The author's stance that it's her car and he isn't paying for it seems justified.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the boyfriend is using a resource that isn't his and not covering the associated costs. The author's frustration is valid. The boyfriend's loss of privilege isn't a punishment without cause; it's a consequence of his repeated failure to meet agreed-upon terms. His reaction of calling her names suggests he's not taking her feelings into account, which tips the balance towards him being in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her financial boundaries and addressing a recurring issue that the boyfriend didn't take seriously. The boyfriend's behavior and response make him the one at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
