I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend use their car anymore because he keeps driving it and leaving it empty without refilling, and he's not contributing to the costs.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses the car three times to visit his grandma, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. That's $60 per trip, so $180 total. The user is upset because they're the only one paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to help with the car since it's not his, and despite warnings, he keeps not refilling the tank. Now, when he wants to take another trip, the user says no, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nThe key points here are fairness and responsibility. The car is the user's, and they're covering all expenses. The boyfriend is using it without contributing, which isn't fair. Even though he's not the owner, using someone else's car implies some responsibility, like keeping it fueled up if it's a shared resource or agreed upon. The user set a boundary when warnings didn't work, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from not taking responsibility and dismissing her concerns. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the user isn't wrong for enforcing the rule after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and the user's response is about maintaining boundaries. The accusations of being vindictive might be his way of deflecting blame. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the user isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their property and expenses after clear breaches of agreed-upon usage. The boyfriend should have communicated better or offered to contribute.\n"
