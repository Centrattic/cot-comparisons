I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he's been borrowing her car and not refilling the gas.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The boyfriend and author have been together for three years and live together. He sold his car when he went to university, so he's relying on her car. She pays for maintenance and insurance, and he refuses to contribute because it's not his car. That seems like a problem right there. If they're living together, maybe they should split costs? But he's not contributing, which could be an issue.\n\nThen, he borrows the car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. A full trip can be done on one tank, costing $60. He's done this three times, and she's upset because she's paying for the gas. He apologizes each time but doesn't fix the behavior. She warned him multiple times, and now he wants to take the car again, so she says no. He reacts angrily, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she's been reasonable, gave warnings, and he didn't change. She's standing up for her own expenses. From the boyfriend's side, he might feel that visiting family is important and maybe he thought he could handle the gas later, or he didn't realize it was a big deal. But he's not contributing to the car's costs at all, which seems unfair. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's expenses, which they both use. 2) He's been negligent in refilling the gas despite warnings. 3) The author is trying to enforce boundaries after multiple issues. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's setting a boundary after repeated problems. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility for his actions, and the author is within her rights to stop letting him borrow the car. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
