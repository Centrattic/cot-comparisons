I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The main issue is about the boyfriend borrowing the car without refilling the gas and not contributing to the costs, leading the author to stop letting him borrow the car. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live together, so there's shared living expenses. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university. The author has a car she pays for, including maintenance and insurance. He borrows it to visit his grandmother, which is a 3.5-hour trip. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. This has happened three times. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it, saying he'll remember next time but doesn't. Now, when he wants to go again, the author refuses, and he gets upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo the key points here are: the boyfriend is using the author's car without compensating for the gas, which is a recurring issue. The author has tried to communicate and set boundaries, but he hasn't respected them. By refusing to let him borrow the car anymore, she's trying to enforce her rules. The boyfriend's reaction seems defensive and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if two people live together, it's reasonable to expect that shared expenses, like car usage, are split. Even if he doesn't own the car, using it repeatedly for long trips without contributing to the costs is unreasonable. The author is the one bearing all the financial burden, which isn't fair. The boyfriend's refusal to acknowledge this and his hostile response suggest that he's not taking her concerns seriously.\n\nThe author's action of stopping the car usage is a logical consequence after repeated warnings. He had multiple chances to correct his behavior but didn't. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for setting this boundary. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning here because he's defensive and not considering her financial burden. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
