  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow their car anymore. The boyfriend has been using her car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he leaves it empty and she has to pay the gas. She's told him multiple times to stop if he keeps doing this, but he's upset now when she enforced it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. She owns the car, pays for maintenance and insurance. He's been borrowing it, but not refilling the gas. She's angry because she's shouldering all the costs and he's not contributing. He's defensive, says she's holding onto old stuff. She's now blocking him from using the car, which he's upset about.\n\nSo, the main issue is fairness and responsibility. She's the one paying for the car and gas, and he's using it without contributing. He's agreed to not do it but keeps breaking the agreement. When she finally enforces the rule, he's upset. \n\nIn relationships, sharing assets can be tricky. If he agreed to pay for gas or help maintain the car, then not doing so is unfair. But he refuses to pay anything because it's not his car. That seems like an issue. She's being responsible by setting boundaries. If he's not respecting her terms, then she's justified in not letting him use the car anymore. \n\nHe's taking the car for a 3.5-hour trip, which is a long drive, and not refilling the tank. That's a significant expense. She's trying to communicate her needs, and he's not listening. Her response to stop him from using the car is a logical consequence after repeated warnings. His reaction (calling her juvenile, bringing up old stuff) suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself when he's not respecting her terms. The answer should be B.\n"
