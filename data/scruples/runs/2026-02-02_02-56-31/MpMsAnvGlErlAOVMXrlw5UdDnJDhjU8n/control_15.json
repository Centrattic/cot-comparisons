I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing her car and not refilling the gas.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time using all the gas and not reimbursing her. The car is hers, and she's responsible for all costs. The boyfriend hasn't contributed anything, even though they live together. She warned him multiple times, and he ignored her. Now, when he asked to borrow the car again, she said no, and he got angry, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nSo, the key points here are ownership of the car and responsibility. The car is hers, and he's using it without contributing. She's within her rights to set boundaries about its use. He's not honoring her requests, which leads her to revoke his privilege. His reaction is about blame-shifting rather than acknowledging her concerns.\n\nThe main question is about fairness. Since the car is hers, she's responsible for expenses. He's not helping, which is unfair. Her response is a consequence for his repeated failures to comply. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable; she's trying to enforce her terms. The boyfriend's behavior is disrespectful and disrespectful of her property. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
