I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he doesn't pay for gas when he borrows her car.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip costs $60 in gas. The author has warned him several times, but he ignores the warnings. Now, when he wants to take a day trip to see his grandma again, she refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend is using the author's car, which he isn't paying for the maintenance, insurance, or gas. He's been asked multiple times to either pay or return the car with a full tank, but he doesn't. The author removes his privilege to borrow the car, which leads to conflict.\n\nLegally and ethically, if someone is using another person's property, they should cover the costs associated with its use. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's expenses, which the author is clearly upset about. The author has given him chances to correct his behavior, but he hasn't. By revoking the car use, she's trying to enforce boundaries she's set. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be deflecting blame onto the author, calling her names, and not taking responsibility for his actions. The author's decision is based on his repeated failures to respect her terms. In this scenario, she's standing up for her own financial and emotional boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here, and the author is justified in her response.\n"
