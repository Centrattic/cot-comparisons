I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend (the author) won't let her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing her car, using up the gas, and not paying for it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend sold his car to go to university, so he doesn't have a car anymore. The author has a small car she owns, which she's paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend uses her car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip costs $60 in gas. He apologizes but doesn't change his behavior. The author warns him, and when he plans another trip, she revokes his permission. He gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's owning the car, paying all costs, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. He uses her car for his family visits, which are 3.5 hours away, so it's a significant trip. She has given warnings, but he hasn't changed. She's trying to set a boundary. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that visiting his grandma is important and that he's only borrowing the car when needed. However, he's not contributing financially, which seems unfair to the author.\n\nLegally, the car is hers, so she can set the terms of its use. Ethically, when someone borrows a car, especially repeatedly, they should cover the costs like gas. The boyfriend isn't doing that, which is the main point of contention. The author is trying to enforce her boundaries after multiple infractions. His reaction is aggressive, calling her names, which suggests he's not respecting her decision.\n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the boyfriend is the one using the car without covering the costs, and the author is the one setting a boundary. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. The author isn't wrong for protecting her car and finances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
