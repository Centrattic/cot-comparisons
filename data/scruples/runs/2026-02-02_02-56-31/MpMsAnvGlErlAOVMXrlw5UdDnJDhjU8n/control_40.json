I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let's first understand the scenario.\n\nThe boyfriend and the author live together, and she owns a car which she's still paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend uses her car multiple times, including visiting his grandma who lives 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes the car with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. This has happened three times, and he's never paid for the gas or the maintenance. The author has warned him several times that if this continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he insists on taking it again, she revokes the permission, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the author's actions. The key points here are ownership, responsibility, and communication. The car is the author's, and she's the one paying for it. The boyfriend is using it without contributing financially, which is a common issue in shared living situations. The boyfriend's behavior is clearly negligent in terms of not refilling the gas, despite being asked. The author has given warnings, which he ignored. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is within her rights to set boundaries regarding her personal property. The boyfriend is not contributing to the costs he's incurring, which is a sign of irresponsibility. The author's decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a reasonable response to his repeated violations of the agreed-upon terms. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. Calling her juvenile and holding grudges is an unfair characterization. The author is reacting to ongoing, unaddressed issues rather than past grievances. The boyfriend's refusal to take responsibility (saying he forgot) and lack of financial contribution exacerbate the problem. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because she's setting boundaries for her property. The boyfriend's behavior is the root issue here. She's tried to communicate her expectations and followed up with a consequence after multiple warnings. His response is an overreaction, and he's the one who's not respecting her property and financial boundaries.\n"
