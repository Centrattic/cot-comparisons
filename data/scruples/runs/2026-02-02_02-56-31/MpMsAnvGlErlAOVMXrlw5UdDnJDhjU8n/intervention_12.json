  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow their car anymore after he consistently didn't return it with a full tank and wouldn't contribute to the costs. They've been together three years, live together, and he sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. She's the one paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and gas. He borrows it to visit his grandma 3.5 hours away, which takes a full tank each way, and he never refuels. She's told him multiple times that if this keeps happening, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. He got angry when she enforced that rule.\n\nSo, the main issue here is fairness. She's paying for the car and gas, and he's using it without contributing. Even though he's her partner, it's her property. If he's not willing to share the costs, is it reasonable for her to restrict his access? \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if he's using a resource she owns, contributing to the costs would be expected. He's not just borrowing the car; he's using a significant amount of gas each time (around $60 per trip), which adds up over three times. She's given warnings, and he's dismissed her concerns. Now she's enforcing the rule, and he's upset. \n\nLegally, she's not in the wrong because it's her car. Ethically, she's within her rights to set boundaries. He's the one who hasn't respected her boundaries by not paying for the gas. His reaction of anger and calling her names suggests he's not taking responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). He's the one misusing the car and not respecting her terms, so she's justified in revoking the privilege.\n"
