I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, but not refilling the gas each time. The girl is upset because he's not paying for the maintenance, insurance, or gas, and he keeps draining the tank. She finally says no when he asks to borrow the car again, and he gets angry, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The girl's main issue is that her boyfriend is using her car without contributing to the costs. Even though it's her car, he's benefiting from it, and she's covering all expenses. He's borrowed it multiple times, each time leaving it with empty gas, which costs her money. She's warned him before, but he didn't change his behavior. When she finally denies him the car, he reacts negatively, calling her names.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's reasonable for her to expect him to cover some of the costs, especially since he's using the car. Gas is a direct expense when using a car, so not refilling it would be equivalent to her paying for his trips. Since he refuses to pay for maintenance, insurance, or gas, he's essentially free-riding on her resources. Her decision to stop letting him borrow the car because he hasn't respected her boundaries is a valid response to his repeated disregard for her needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that visiting family is important and that the girl is being too strict. However, his argument that he \"forgot\" each time doesn't hold up because he's been warned multiple times. The fact that he didn't offer to pay for the gas despite knowing the cost suggests a lack of consideration.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the girl) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Based on the analysis, she's standing up for herself after multiple infractions. Her boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful, and her response is a reasonable consequence. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
