  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining her gas and not paying.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend borrowed the car three times for a 3.5-hour trip, each time taking it full and returning empty. Each tank costs $60. He refuses to pay for maintenance, insurance, or gas because it's not his car. The user warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now, when he wants to take the car again, she says no, and he's upset, calling her names.\n\nHmm, the key points here are fairness and communication. The user is paying for the car's expenses, including gas, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. Even though he's borrowing the car, the cost is on her. He's not honoring the agreement by not refilling the tank or covering the costs. The user is trying to set boundaries after clear communication, but he's not respecting that, which leads to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, especially living together and sharing resources like a car, it's important to have mutual agreements. If he's using the car and benefiting from it (visiting grandma, other trips), he should contribute to the costs. The user isn't wrong for setting boundaries when he's not respecting her terms. His reaction of calling her names suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously, which is on him.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself after repeated issues, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's lack of accountability makes him at fault here. Answer B.\n"
