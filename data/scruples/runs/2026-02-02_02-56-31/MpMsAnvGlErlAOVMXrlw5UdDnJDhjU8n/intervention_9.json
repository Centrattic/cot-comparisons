  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing the car without refilling the gas. They have a three-year relationship and live together. The boyfriend doesn't pay for the car's maintenance or insurance, just uses it when he needs. He takes it to see his grandma three times, each time leaving it empty, costing $60 each time. The user warned him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting and doesn't offer to pay. Now he wants to take the car again, but she says no, and he's upset, calling her names.\n\nFirst, the financial aspect: the car is hers, she's responsible for all expenses. He's not contributing, which is already a point of contention. Borrowing without contributing is unfair. Gas is a recurring cost, and he's using it without replacing the cost. Even if he's borrowing with permission, he should be responsible for the gas, especially since the car is her property. He's not just borrowing; he's using a resource he's not paying for, which is unreasonable.\n\nThen, the communication: she warned him multiple times. He promised to remember but didn't. This shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. When she finally takes away the privilege, he reacts badly, calling her names. That's a red flag for disrespect and not taking her feelings seriously. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, she's justified in setting boundaries. If he wants to use the car, he should either pay for the gas or find another way. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and inconsiderate of her financial responsibility. The user isn't being vindictive; she's enforcing the rules she set. Her reaction is a consequence of his repeated negligence. \n\nPossible counterarguments: maybe the boyfriend isn't intentionally trying to be inconsiderate. But even if it's forgetful, he should take responsibility and offer to refill the tank. The fact that he didn't is a problem. The user's stance is about accountability. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions were disrespectful and inconsiderate, and her response is a reasonable consequence.\n"
