I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend, living together for three years. The key issue is about the boyfriend borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he leaves it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. He's done this three times and other trips, never replacing the gas or contributing to the car's expenses. The author has warned him multiple times, and when he asks to borrow the car again, she refuses. He reacts angrily, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness here. The car is the author's, and she's covering all maintenance, insurance, and gas costs. The boyfriend isn't paying anything, which seems unfair. The repeated borrowing without contributing to the costs is a red flag. He promised to bring it back full but hasn't, despite being warned. The author's response is to stop allowing him to borrow the car, which is a logical consequence based on his failure to follow through. The boyfriend's reaction is dismissive and accuses her of holding grudges, which seems like he's not taking responsibility.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate. He benefits from the car without contributing, which is a basic expectation in a relationship. The author is within her rights to set boundaries. The boyfriend's anger and accusations are misplaced because the problem lies with his behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing her rules after repeated violations. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
