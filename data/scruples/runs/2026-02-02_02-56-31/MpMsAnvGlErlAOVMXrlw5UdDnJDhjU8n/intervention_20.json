  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend uses her car to visit his grandma, takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. This has happened three times, and she's told him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car. Now he's upset and accused her of being juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, the main issue is fairness regarding shared responsibilities. The car is hers, and he's using it without contributing to the costs. Even though they live together, the car isn't his, so he's not paying for gas or maintenance. The girlfriend has tried to communicate her boundaries, but he keeps not following through. She's enforcing her decision by revoking the car usage, which he's reacting negatively to.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be a problem. He's not taking her concerns seriously, ignoring the financial impact, and dismissing her boundaries. The girlfriend is standing up for herself after repeated issues, which is reasonable. She's given warnings and followed through, so she's not overreacting. The boyfriend's behavior (not paying for gas, not filling up) is the root issue here, not her response to it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B. She's not in the wrong for setting boundaries and stopping the car borrowing after he didn't respect her wishes. His reaction is part of the problem, not hers.\n"
