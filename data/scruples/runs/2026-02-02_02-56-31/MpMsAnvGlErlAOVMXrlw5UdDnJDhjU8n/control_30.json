I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is in a three-year relationship with her boyfriend, and they live together. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago, so he's been using her car. The car is hers, and she's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to contribute to the car's costs unless it's his. His grandma lives 3.5 hours away, and he's visited her a few times using her car. Each time, he takes the car with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. This has happened three times, and he keeps forgetting to refill the tank or offer to pay. The author has warned him multiple times that if he continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he tries to take it for another visit, she revokes his permission, and he reacts negatively, calling her juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong (A) or not (B)?\n\nFirst, I should consider the ownership and responsibility. The car is hers, so she owns it. She's paying all the expenses, which includes gas, maintenance, insurance. The boyfriend isn't contributing anything, which could be a problem because he's using the car but not sharing the costs. She's being reasonable by expecting him to either pay for the gas he uses or at least refill the tank after borrowing it. He's repeatedly not doing that, despite warnings. \n\nHe's taken the car for multiple trips, including three visits to his grandma, and other things. Each time, he uses up the gas but doesn't replace it or pay. That's a pattern of behavior. The author has given him warnings, which he ignores. Now, when she takes away the car privilege, he's upset and accuses her of holding grudges. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone uses another person's property (in this case, the car) and causes them financial loss, the person using it should compensate or take responsibility. The boyfriend isn't doing that, so the author is justified in her actions. Revoking the car privilege after multiple warnings is a reasonable response. His reaction is defensive and dismissive, which suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously. \n\nAnother angle: Does the boyfriend have a right to use the car? Since they live together, maybe there's an unspoken agreement. But since the car is hers and he's not contributing, it's her right to set boundaries. She's not wrong for expecting him to take responsibility for the gas usage. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe they are in a committed relationship, so sharing expenses is normal. But the problem is he's not contributing to the car's costs. If he's using it, even if the car is hers, splitting gas costs would be fair. However, the author hasn't mentioned him contributing to gas for other things. So she's within her rights to enforce the rules after repeated violations.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own financial interests and setting boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
