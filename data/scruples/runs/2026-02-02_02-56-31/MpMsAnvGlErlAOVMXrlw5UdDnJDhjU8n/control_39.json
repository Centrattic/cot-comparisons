I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe boyfriend and girlfriend live together and have been in a relationship for three years. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago, so he's been relying on the girlfriend's car. The girlfriend owns a small car she just paid off but still covers maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to pay for anything related to the car since it's not his, but he borrows it multiple times, taking it for a 3.5-hour trip to his grandma's and other purposes. Each time, he leaves the tank empty, costing her $60 each time. The girlfriend has warned him several times, but he keeps forgetting or not offering to refill the gas. Now, when he wants to go again, she says no because of his repeated irresponsibility. He gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend is using a car he doesn't own and isn't contributing financially to it. The girlfriend feels it's unfair and has set a boundary after multiple infractions. The boyfriend is upset and not taking responsibility. \n\nI need to assess if the author (girlfriend) is in the wrong. The boyfriend isn't paying for gas or maintenance, which is his car's responsibility if he's using it. Even if the car isn't his, when he borrows it, he should be respectful and cover the costs incurred. The girlfriend has given multiple warnings and he hasn't complied, so she's taking away his privilege. That seems reasonable because he's not respecting her boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction of anger and accusations suggests he's not taking responsibility. \n\nTherefore, the girlfriend isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her property and finances after repeated issues. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate, so the author (B) is not in the wrong.\n"
