  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend use their car. First, the boyfriend has borrowed her car multiple times to visit his grandma, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip costs $60 for gas. He's been told multiple times to either fill it up or pay for the gas, but he hasn't done either. The user is now refusing to let him use the car anymore, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the main points are: ownership of the car, responsibility for gas, and the boyfriend's repeated failure to comply with the user's requests. The user owns the car, maintains it, and pays for insurance and maintenance. The boyfriend isn't contributing to any of these costs, which is a point of contention. The gas issue is about fairness\u2014using someone else's car without covering the operational costs. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is dismissive, blaming the user for being juvenile. The user is standing her ground, which is understandable given the repeated violations. The key here is whether the user has a right to set boundaries about how her property is used. Since she's the owner, she's within her rights to refuse use if the terms of borrowing aren't respected. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his part of the agreement (keeping the tank full or paying), so her revoking the privilege isn't unreasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B, No, she's not in the wrong. She's asserting her ownership and boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of consideration for her expenses, and she's justified in stopping it. His reaction is more about defensiveness than right or wrong.\n"
