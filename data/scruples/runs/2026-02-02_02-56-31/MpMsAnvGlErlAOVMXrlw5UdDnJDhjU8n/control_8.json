I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing her car without refilling the gas.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend lives with her and they've been together for three years. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The author has a car she pays for, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend uses her car but refuses to pay for anything related to it. \n\nHe's visited his grandma three times, each time taking the car with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip uses a full tank, costing $60. The author is upset about the recurring cost and has warned him multiple times. He apologizes each time but doesn't follow through. Now, he wants to take the car again for a weekend trip, and the author refuses. He gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, does she have a right to say no? Well, the car is hers, and she's paying all the costs. He's using it without contributing, which isn't fair. She's given him chances to correct his behavior but he hasn't. His response is to accuse her of being unfair, which suggests he doesn't see the problem. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, she's not in the wrong. He's using her resources without contributing, and she's setting a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction seems immature and dismissive of her concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
