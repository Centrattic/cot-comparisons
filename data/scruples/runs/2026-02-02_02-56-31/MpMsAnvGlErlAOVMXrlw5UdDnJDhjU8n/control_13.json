I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend not paying for gas when borrowing his girlfriend's car. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple lives together, and the boyfriend sold his car when he went to university. The girl has her own car, which she pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend borrows the car to visit his grandma 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing around $60 each trip. This has happened three times, and he never pays for the gas despite being asked. The girl threatened to stop letting him borrow the car, and when he tried again, she refused, leading to an argument where he accused her of being vindictive.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend is using her car and depleting the gas without contributing to the costs. Even if the car is hers, the gas is her expense. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for the gas he uses seems unfair. The author is trying to set a boundary by saying no to future use until he respects the costs. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be dismissing her valid concerns, which might make him the one in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a cultural or situational nuance I'm missing. In some contexts, splitting gas costs might be expected for long trips. But since the boyfriend is using the car multiple times and not contributing, it's reasonable for the author to expect him to cover the expenses. The boyfriend's repeated ignoring of this and then reacting negatively when boundaries are set supports the author's stance. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's standing up for her financial responsibilities. The boyfriend should have covered the gas costs, and his reaction is defensive and dismissive. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
