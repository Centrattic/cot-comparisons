Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend borrowing a car and not refilling the gas each time. The author is refusing to let him borrow the car anymore because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The boyfriend and his girlfriend live together and have been in a three-year relationship. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The girl has her own small car, which she maintains and insures, and she's the only one paying for it. He refuses to contribute since it's not his car. His grandma lives 3.5 hours away. He's visited her a few times, each time borrowing the car with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time, she's upset about the cost of gas, which is $60 per tank. He says sorry but doesn't fix the behavior. She warned him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now, he wants to take it for a day trip, but she's denying him, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the key points here are: ownership of the car, financial responsibility, and communication. The car is hers, and she's the one paying for everything. He's using her car without contributing financially. Even though he's borrowing it, the cost is on her, and he's not honoring his part when he says sorry. She's given clear warnings, and he's not following through. The argument arises when she enforces the rules, and he's upset about it.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone uses another person's property, especially when there's a cost involved, they should be responsible for those costs. The boyfriend isn't paying anything towards the car's maintenance, insurance, or gas, which are all her expenses. The fact that he uses the car for personal trips and doesn't cover the gas each time is a recurring issue. She's set boundaries, and when he violates them, she's taking action to enforce those boundaries. His reaction seems to be about her enforcing her rules rather than the issue itself, which might indicate that he's not taking her feelings into account.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's still her boyfriend, and maybe she should be more lenient, especially for visiting family. But the problem is that he's not respecting her financial boundaries. She's made it clear that if the behavior continues, he loses the privilege. She's not being vindictive by following through; she's holding him accountable after multiple warnings. His response of calling her names suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously, which could indicate that he's in the wrong for not respecting her rules and for his reaction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her financial boundaries and following through on her warnings, which is reasonable. The boyfriend is not contributing to the costs and is disregarding her feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
