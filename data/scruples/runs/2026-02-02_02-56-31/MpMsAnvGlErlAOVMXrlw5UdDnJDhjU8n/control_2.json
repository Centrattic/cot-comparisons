I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore. The situation involves the boyfriend repeatedly borrowing the car, using up the gas, and not contributing to the costs despite living together for three years.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each time leaving it empty. The cost of gas each trip is $60, and this has happened three times. The author has tried to warn him, but he keeps doing it and doesn't help with maintenance or insurance. Now, when he wants to take the car again, she refuses, leading to an argument where he calls her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the car is hers, and she's paying for everything. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is a key point. Even though they live together, unless there's an agreement that he contributes to car expenses, he's not doing his part. Using the car without refilling the gas is a financial burden on her. She's setting boundaries after multiple warnings, which seems reasonable. His reaction is dismissive and disrespectful, not acknowledging her feelings or the costs involved. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's not his car doesn't absolve him from responsibility, especially since he's using it. The fact that he's taken it for other trips without refueling shows a pattern. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a response to his consistent irresponsibility. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
