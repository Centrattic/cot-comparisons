I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who borrows the author's car to visit his grandma, but each time he returns it with an empty tank. The car is the author's, and she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to contribute to the car's costs, even though they live together. The author has warned him multiple times, and now she's decided not to let him borrow the car anymore after he blew up at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership and responsibility. The car is the author's, so she's the one responsible for its expenses. The boyfriend isn't paying anything towards it, which is a point of contention. Borrowing a car usually comes with the understanding that the borrower is responsible for any costs involved, like gas. If you borrow someone else's car and use up their gas, it's fair to either refill it or reimburse them. The boyfriend is doing neither, which is unfair to the author. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's \"not his car\" is weak because he's using it and benefiting from it. Since they live together, it's possible that there's an implicit agreement about shared responsibilities, but the boyfriend isn't contributing. The author has tried to address the issue calmly, giving warnings, but he's not compliant. The last straw was when he wanted to take the car for a weekend trip and she refused. His reaction\u2014calling her names and bringing up past issues\u2014suggests he's handling the conflict poorly.\n\nThe key points here are consent and fairness. The author is within her rights to set boundaries about her property. If someone repeatedly disrespects those boundaries, it's reasonable to revoke their permission to use the property. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and inconsiderate of her financial input. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing her rules, especially after multiple warnings. The boyfriend's loss of temper and accusations of holding grudges seem like deflection from his own inconsiderate actions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
