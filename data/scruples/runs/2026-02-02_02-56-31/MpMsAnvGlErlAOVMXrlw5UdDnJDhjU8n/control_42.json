I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The main issue is the boyfriend repeatedly borrowing the car without refilling the gas or contributing to costs. The author decided to stop letting him borrow the car after several warnings, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has used the car three times for his grandmother's visits, each time draining the gas tank. The cost is $60 per tank. The author is upset because she's covering all expenses. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything towards the car since it's not his. She's given warnings, but he didn't change his behavior. Now, when he wants to take another trip, she refuses, and he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nI need to analyze if the author is in the wrong. The key points are responsibility and fairness. The boyfriend is using a car he doesn't own, without contributing to its costs. The author has a right to set boundaries. Repeatedly borrowing without paying gas is unfair. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive and disrespectful. The author's action to stop the borrowing after warnings is a reasonable consequence. The boyfriend's accusations of her being juvenile might be invalid if she's just enforcing agreed-upon rules. So, likely the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
