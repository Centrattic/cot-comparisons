I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore because he keeps using it without refilling the gas. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend has been borrowing the car multiple times, taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The author is covering the cost of maintenance, insurance, and gas, which totals $60 per trip. She's asked him multiple times to either pay for the gas or refill it, but he keeps forgetting or not doing it. After several warnings, she decided to stop letting him borrow the car, which led to a conflict.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it seems like the boyfriend is not taking responsibility for the costs he's incurring. The car is the author's, so she's the one paying for all expenses. It's reasonable for her to expect that if he uses the car, he should cover the gas costs, especially since it's a significant expense each time. The boyfriend's refusal to pay or refill the tank shows a lack of consideration for her financial burden. \n\nThe author giving multiple warnings and then following through on her statement to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a logical consequence. The boyfriend's reaction, calling her juvenile and vindictive, seems to be deflecting blame. The key issue here is shared responsibility and respect for each other's property and expenses. Since the author is the sole owner of the car, she has the right to set these boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
