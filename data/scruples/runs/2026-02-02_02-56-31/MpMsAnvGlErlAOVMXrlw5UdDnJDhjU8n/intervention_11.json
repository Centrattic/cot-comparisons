  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma. The key points are about the car and gas expenses. The boyfriend has taken the car multiple times, each time leaving it empty, costing the user $60 each time. The user has warned him several times, but he hasn't changed his behavior. Now she's denying him the car, and he's upset, calling her names.\n\nFirst, the financial aspect. The car is hers, and she's responsible for all costs. The boyfriend isn't contributing to insurance or maintenance, which he says isn't his car. But he's using it for long trips, which depletes the gas tank every time. She's paying for the gas he uses. That seems unfair because he benefits from the car without sharing the costs. Even though it's her car, if he's using it, especially for long trips, it's reasonable to expect some contribution. However, he keeps forgetting to refill the gas, despite previous warnings. Each time he takes it, she ends up out of pocket for $60. \n\nShe told him if he continues this behavior, she won't let him borrow the car. He gets angry, accuses her of being vindictive. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, she's setting boundaries after repeated issues. She's tried to communicate and warn him multiple times. He's not respecting her boundaries. Her decision to stop letting him use the car is a reasonable response to protect her own resources. His reaction of calling her names and not taking responsibility seems like an overreaction. \n\nLegally, since it's her car, she can set the rules. Emotionally, she's standing up for herself after being let down repeatedly. He's not acknowledging her feelings and is instead attacking her character. \n\nSo, in this scenario, she's not in the wrong. She's protecting her investment and setting necessary boundaries. His behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
