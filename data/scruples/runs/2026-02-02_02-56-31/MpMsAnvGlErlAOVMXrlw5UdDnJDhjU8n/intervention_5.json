  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA, wont let my boyfriend visit his grandma.\nBackground info: \n\nMy boyfriend and I of three years live together he sold his car when he went back to university 2 years ago. I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing their boyfriend to borrow her car anymore because he keeps using it to visit his grandma and draining the gas without refilling it, and not contributing to the costs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. They live together, so there's a shared living arrangement. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university, so he relies on her car. She's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. He's been borrowing the car multiple times for trips, using up gas each time and not replenishing it. She's given warnings but he hasn't changed his behavior. Now she's decided to stop allowing him to borrow the car, leading to a conflict where he accuses her of being unreasonable.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, she's covering all the costs of the car, including gas for his trips. He's using her resources without contributing. The boyfriend's refusal to pay anything towards the car or gas seems to be a point of contention. Even if he's borrowing the car with permission, the ongoing cost of gas is something he should be responsible for, especially if he's using it for personal visits. The fact that he keeps forgetting or not following through on refilling the gas shows a lack of consideration for her expenses.\n\nShe's tried communicating her concerns and given warnings, which is a responsible approach. When someone repeatedly ignores agreed-upon boundaries despite being warned, it's reasonable to take action to protect one's own interests. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about defending his own actions rather than acknowledging her valid concerns about the financial impact. His accusations that she's being juvenile or holding grudges don't address the actual issues of shared responsibility and fairness.\n\nIn relationships, especially when sharing resources like a car, both parties should contribute to the costs if they're using the shared resource. Since he's not paying for any part of the car, his usage without contribution is a problem. She's within her rights to set boundaries to prevent further financial strain on herself. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for deciding to stop allowing him to borrow the car after repeated issues.\n"
