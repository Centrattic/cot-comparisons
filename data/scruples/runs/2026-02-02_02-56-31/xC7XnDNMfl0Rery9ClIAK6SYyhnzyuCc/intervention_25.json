It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The main points are that the wife is going away for a week, it's her first time away since the kids were born, and the husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. The kids are picky eaters, so the husband asked her to prep the meals. She got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband is taking on a lot by doing everything alone for a week. The wife is going on a trip, which is understandable. The request is to meal prep, which might be seen as an extra task. But he's asking because he's concerned about the kids' preferences and not wanting meltdowns. \n\nWhy would the wife be upset? Maybe she feels it's an additional burden, especially if she was already preparing for her trip. Or perhaps there's an assumption that cooking is her responsibility, and she might feel it's unfair. But the husband is trying to make things easier for himself. \n\nThe key here is whether the request was reasonable. Meal prepping can take time, but since she's going on a trip, maybe she has the time to do it before leaving. The husband's intention is to avoid stress during the week. However, if the wife feels overwhelmed by the request, that's a valid emotion. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? I don't think so. He's asking for help to manage a situation that's outside his usual routine. It's a practical request to ensure things run smoothly in her absence. The wife's reaction might stem from stress about the trip or feeling overburdened. But the husband isn't wrong for wanting to prepare. He's trying to be proactive. So the answer should be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
