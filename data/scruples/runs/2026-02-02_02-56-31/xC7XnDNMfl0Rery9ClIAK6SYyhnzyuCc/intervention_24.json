It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going on her first trip away from the kids, so maybe she's feeling guilty or stressed about leaving. The husband is trying to plan ahead to reduce stress while she's away. His request seems reasonable given the circumstances\u2014meal prepping can save time and reduce the chance of mealtime conflicts with picky eaters.\n\nBut why did she get upset? Maybe she feels it's an added burden right before her trip. Or perhaps she feels it's not her responsibility anymore. Maybe she's been handling cooking all along, and he's now asking for more prep work when she's about to be gone. It could be a communication issue. The husband might not have considered her perspective\u2014maybe she's already stressed about the trip and the prep adds to that.\n\nIs the request fair? It's a week of prepping, which could be time-consuming. If they normally take turns or if she's the primary cook, maybe it's reasonable. But if she's already planning a trip, maybe the timing is bad. The husband's alternative is to make sandwiches, which might be easier but not ideal for the kids. The key here is whether the request is reasonable given their usual roles and the timing.\n\nThe wife's response might indicate feelings of resentment or feeling taken for granted. If she's upset, perhaps he could have approached it differently\u2014maybe offering to help with some prep or acknowledging her effort. But the core question is whether the request itself is fair. Since she's the one who will be away, maybe it's reasonable to ask for some preparation. However, if she's already planning a trip and is under stress, the added work might be a burden. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if they have a shared responsibility but she's handling cooking, asking her to prep before she leaves could be seen as expecting her to do more. But the husband is also taking on her usual chores, so maybe the prep would help balance the workload during her absence. \n\nI think the husband's reasoning is valid, but the wife's reaction might stem from stress or feeling overwhelmed. The husband might not be in the wrong, but the situation could benefit from better communication. The answer is likely B, but there's room for nuance. Since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, and the wife's refusal is based on it being too much work, maybe the husband's request is reasonable but needs to consider her feelings. However, the core of the question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer is B, No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
