It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to meal prep for the kids because he's not as confident in cooking as she is. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that since the wife knows the kids' food preferences better, meal prepping would help him manage without her. He's also taking over her chores, so he's under pressure. The wife's response was negative, feeling it's too much to ask, even though she's the one going away.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask someone to prepare meals before a trip? Well, if the wife is the one who normally does the cooking and knows the kids' preferences, then asking her to preplan meals before leaving might be a fair request. It's about sharing the workload and ensuring the kids have familiar meals, which the husband is worried about. On the other hand, the wife might feel that since she's going away, she's already contributing by doing the prep work, which could be time-consuming. But she's the one who's going on the trip, so maybe she's in a better position to handle the prep before leaving.\n\nThe husband isn't asking her to do the cooking while she's away, just to plan and prepare the meals in advance. Since she's the primary cook, her knowledge is crucial for the kids' meals. The wife's reaction might stem from stress or feeling overwhelmed, but the husband's request seems reasonable given the circumstances. The key point is that the request is to make things easier during her absence, not to add more work during her trip. So, the husband isn't in the wrong here. He's trying to prepare and asking for help in a logical way. The wife's refusal could be due to her own stress, but that doesn't make the husband's request unfair. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
