It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the user will be handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is usually the wife's job, and she knows the kids' preferences better. The user wants her to prep meals for the week. She's upset and thinks it's too much, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nHmm, the user's reasoning is that he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food. He's asking for help to manage his workload. On the other hand, the wife is stressed about the prep work and the trip itself. First-time being away from the kids might add to her stress. Maybe she feels overburdened. But is the user being unreasonable?\n\nWell, the wife is going on a trip, which is her time off. The user is considering the kids' needs and his own capacity. He's not expecting her to do all the prep, just some meals. The key might be communication. Did he consider her workload? Maybe she's already stressed about the trip and the extra work is adding to it. Alternatively, is he asking for something reasonable? Meal prepping isn't that bad, but maybe the amount is.\n\nBut in relationships, it's about mutual support. If the user understands that the wife is already stressed about leaving, maybe he should offer more support instead of adding tasks. However, he's also managing a lot. Maybe there's a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the request is reasonable. Since it's a week of meals and the wife is used to cooking, asking her to prep might not be unreasonable. But if the wife is already overwhelmed, maybe the user should adjust. However, the user's intention is to avoid problems with the kids. So, no, he's not in the wrong. The wife might need to communicate her stress better, but the user's request is practical. So answer B.\n"
