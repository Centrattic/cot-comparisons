I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband will be handling all chores and cooking alone. Normally, the wife does the cooking, and since the kids are picky, he's asking her to prep meals for the week. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested that if things get hard, he can just make sandwiches. The author feels he's not in the wrong because he's preparing for potential meltdowns from the kids and the trip is her choice.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The husband is trying to manage a sudden increase in responsibility. He's not entirely unable to cook but is less efficient at it, especially with picky eaters. The wife is going on her trip, so she's aware of the situation and the added workload. However, she's resistant to prepping meals, which he sees as reasonable support.\n\nNow, considering the wife's perspective: She might feel that the husband should be able to handle things on his own, even if it's a bit more challenging. Or maybe she's overwhelmed with her own trip preparations and doesn't want additional tasks. But the husband is asking for help to avoid stress during her absence, which is understandable.\n\nThe question is whether the husband's request is unfair. Since the wife is the one leaving, it's logical for her to assist in smoothing things over during her absence. Meal prepping might be a reasonable request, especially if it's to prevent a bigger problem (kids' meltdowns). The husband isn't shirking responsibility; he's seeking support to manage a situation that's temporarily out of the ordinary. The wife's refusal could be based on her own stress or a different view of fairness, but that doesn't necessarily make the husband wrong.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the husband should have considered alternative solutions or communicated better about his concerns. However, the scenario doesn't indicate that he's being demanding or disrespectful. He's asking for help that aligns with her usual role. The wife's response of suggesting sandwiches might be a way to say she's not willing to help, but the husband's reasoning is about preventing a problem, not laziness.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. It's a reasonable request given the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
