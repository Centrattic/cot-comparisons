It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. So, their wife is going away for a week, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The user is responsible for taking over her chores, including cooking. Normally, the wife cooks, and the kids are picky, so the user is worried about handling that alone.\n\nThe user asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. They feel it's a fair request since she's leaving, and they don't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food. The user is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the user is trying to make the situation easier for themselves by having someone else handle a task they're not confident in doing. The wife's argument is that it's too much work. But the user is asking for help in advance to avoid stress during the week. \n\nBut wait, the wife is going away, so maybe she's already stressed about the trip. Asking her to prep meals might be adding to her pre-trip workload. The user's intention is good, but maybe they didn't consider how much the request would add to her existing tasks. \n\nAlso, the wife's response of suggesting sandwiches might be a way to minimize her effort. The user might not realize that the prep work could be time-consuming and maybe not feasible for her. It's possible the user didn't communicate the request in a way that considers her capacity. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It depends on communication and mutual understanding. If the user didn't consider her workload or didn't approach it as a collaborative effort, maybe they are. If they just expected her to do it without checking in, then perhaps. But if they had a good reason and discussed it, maybe not. The wife's reaction might be valid if the request was too much. \n\nI think the key points are: Did the user consider her workload? Did they make the request unilaterally or discuss it as a team? The user's reasoning is that they need help because they're less experienced, which is a valid concern. However, the wife's refusal could indicate that the request is unreasonable or that she's already overburdened. \n\nSo, maybe the user isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for compromise. They could have discussed alternatives or shared the prep work. Since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), but with some nuance that there's a need for better communication. However, the wife's reaction suggests that the request was too much, so maybe the user is being a bit demanding. But given the circumstances, their concern is understandable. I'm leaning towards B, but it's a bit of a gray area. The main issue is about mutual consideration and communication.\n"
