It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that she's going away for a week, their first time as a parent being left with the kids. He normally handles other chores but cooking is her responsibility. The kids are picky, and he's worried about not knowing their preferences as well as she does. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is practical: he's asking her to do something to make his week easier, especially since she knows the kids' food better. He's taking on more chores, so maybe he's just trying to manage the workload. On the other hand, the wife is going on a trip for the first time and might feel stressed. Meal prepping for a week could be a lot, especially if she's already preparing for her trip (packing, etc.). Her reaction of being upset suggests she felt the request was excessive, maybe because she's already stressed or thinks the husband should handle it.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that it's not unfair to ask since she's the one leaving. But maybe the wife feels like she's already giving up her time for the trip, and adding meal prep on top is too much. Also, the husband might not realize that she's under pressure or that she expects him to step up. Communication is key here. The husband might not be in the wrong, but maybe he could have approached it differently, like discussing the workload and finding a compromise. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress, not the request itself.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about balancing responsibilities. If cooking is her usual role, asking her to prep before she leaves might be reasonable, but considering her current stress from the trip, maybe it's too much. The husband's concern about the kids' meltdowns is valid, but maybe there's a middle ground. The key issue here is mutual understanding and communication. The husband might not be in the wrong, but the wife's feelings are valid too. So, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation where both could adjust their approach.\n"
