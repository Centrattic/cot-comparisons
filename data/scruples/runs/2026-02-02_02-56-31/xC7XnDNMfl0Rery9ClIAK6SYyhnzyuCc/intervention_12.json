It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that she's going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and he wants her to prep meals since the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. She got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is taking on more responsibility during her absence, which makes sense. He's asking her to do something that would make his week easier. But she's resisting, finding it too much work. The key points are mutual responsibility, communication, and fairness.\n\nHe's not forcing her to prep, but she's the one assigned the task usually. Maybe he should have offered to help with prep or discussed alternatives. However, it's understandable to ask someone to do what they normally do before they leave. She might feel overwhelmed if she's already preparing for her trip, and the request adds to her pre-trip workload. \n\nThe user's intention is good\u2014to avoid meltdowns with the kids. But he should also consider her perspective. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prep a few meals instead of all. The question is whether his request is reasonable. Since he's acknowledging he can manage, even if it's harder, and he's not making her do it but is asking, it might not be entirely his fault. Still, better communication could have helped. But in terms of right or wrong, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
