On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that his wife is going away for a week, and he's asking her to pre-prepare dinners for the kids because he's not as confident in cooking for them. She's upset, thinking it's too much, and suggests that if it's too hard, he can just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is asking his wife to do something that's normally her responsibility (cooking), but since she's going on a trip, he wants her to pre-make the meals. His reasoning is that the kids are picky, and he knows she's better at it. The wife is upset because she finds it too much work, and he's arguing that it's fair to ask since she's the one leaving.\n\nNow, considering the fairness here. Is it reasonable to ask a spouse to do something before they leave, especially if it's a regular part of their duties? Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, so maybe she's right in feeling it's too much. But the husband is also in a tough spot, handling all the responsibilities alone for the first time. He's not asking for a huge favor but something that's already part of her routine.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Did the husband consider her workload before the trip? Maybe she's already stressed about the trip, and adding meal prep is extra. But he's also trying to manage his own stress. The wife's suggestion to make sandwiches if it's too hard shows she's trying to find a middle ground, but the husband feels that's not enough because of the kids' preferences.\n\nCultural and relationship norms play a role here. In some relationships, dividing responsibilities like this is standard. Others might expect more flexibility. The question is whether the husband is overstepping by assigning a task during her time away. However, since she's going to be gone, and meal prep is her usual role, maybe it's reasonable to ask her to handle it before she leaves. But the wife's reaction suggests that the amount of work is the issue. The husband might not have considered how much time meal prep for a week would take, which could be a valid point.\n\nAlso, the husband's concern about the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't right is valid. He's trying to prevent stress for himself and the kids. However, the wife might feel that he's not trusting her ability to handle the meal prep or that he's not considering her own stress pre-trip.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't asking for something he can't do himself, just that he's less confident. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but there's a communication gap. The wife's refusal might be because she's overwhelmed, and the husband could have offered to help with the prep or adjusted the request. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the request is reasonable given his situation, then he's not. But if the request is excessive, then maybe he is.\n\nI think the key is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week is a significant task. If the wife feels it's too much, even though it's part of her regular duties, then the husband might be in the wrong for not considering her workload. Alternatively, since she's the one going on a trip and can prepare meals in advance, maybe it's fair. But the answer hinges on whether the amount of work is reasonable. If the husband is asking for more than a normal meal prep, then he's in the wrong. But if it's just the standard prep for a week, then maybe not. The wife's reaction suggests the former, so perhaps the husband is overburdening her. Therefore, he's in the wrong (A). But I'm a bit torn. Another perspective: the husband is trying to manage his responsibilities, so maybe it's not his fault. Hmm. I need to decide based on typical expectations. In many cases, asking a spouse to handle a task they normally do before leaving might be seen as fair, but if it's an excessive amount of work, then it's not. Since the wife is upset about the workload, the husband might not have considered that. So maybe he is in the wrong.\n"
