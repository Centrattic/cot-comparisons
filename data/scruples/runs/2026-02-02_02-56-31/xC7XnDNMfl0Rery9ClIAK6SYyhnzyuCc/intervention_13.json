It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation involves their wife going away for a week, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The user is handling her chores, including cooking, which is usually her responsibility. They asked her to prep meals for the week because the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nHmm, the user's reasoning is that since she's the one cooking more, she knows the kids' food better, so prepping would make it easier. They don't want meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual meals. They don't think it's unfair since she's taking the trip. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, they're trying to prepare for a week without her. They're asking for help to make things manageable. But maybe they didn't consider that the prep might be too much for her. However, the user is handling her half of the chores, so it's logical they want some assistance. The wife's response seems a bit dismissive, suggesting sandwiches as an alternative. \n\nIt depends on communication. If the user asked nicely and the wife felt it was too much, maybe there's a middle ground. But the user's intent is to prevent stress, which is reasonable. Maybe they should have discussed other ways to help, but the request itself isn't unreasonable. The wife's reaction might be part of the issue here. So probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
