On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband will be handling all the childcare and chores alone. The main point is that cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He wants her to prep meals in advance to make things easier, but she's upset that it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, which is a significant change. The husband is relying on her to prepare meals because he's worried about the kids' picky eating habits. She's resisting, saying it's too much work and offers an alternative (sandwiches). The question is whether his request is reasonable.\n\nPossible angles: Is asking for meal prep a reasonable request when someone is going away? Does the wife have a responsibility to help set things up for the husband? Or is she within her rights to say no because it's additional work, even if it's for a good reason?\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's trying to manage alone and wants consistency for the kids. He's not asking her to do the actual cooking during her trip, just to prep in advance. That seems logical. However, the wife might feel that meal prepping is a significant task, especially if she's already busy with her trip preparations. Maybe she didn't expect this extra task right before leaving.\n\nI should also consider the balance of responsibilities. If cooking is her usual role, then prepping beforehand could be seen as a way to support her partner. But if it's an added burden without prior discussion, she might feel resentful. The key might be communication\u2014had this been discussed before, or is it a last-minute request?\n\nAnother point is the husband's alternative of making sandwiches. That's a valid point; maybe he's being flexible but she's not considering that compromise. However, he prefers meals that the kids are used to, which might be more challenging to replicate if he's not as experienced.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is leaving and the husband is taking over her responsibilities, it's reasonable to ask for some preparation to ease the transition. But if meal prepping is a new task not part of their usual routine, it might add unexpected work for her. The wife's resistance could stem from feeling overburdened, especially if she's already preparing for her trip.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the husband in the wrong? It depends on how the request was made and their usual dynamics. If they've established that she's responsible for meal prep in her absence, then it's fair. If not, maybe it's an added stress. But in the context provided, the husband's intention is to manage the kids' needs, which is a valid concern. The wife's reaction might be about the workload, but the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting support. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
