It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is at fault for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born, and the husband will have to take over her chores. The main point of contention is that the husband asked her to prep meals for the week because the kids are picky and he's not as confident in his cooking skills. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he could just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is asking for help in advance to manage a challenging week. He's aware of his limitations and wants to avoid stress and possible kid meltdowns. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is an additional burden when she's already preparing for a trip. Maybe she's overwhelmed with her own tasks and doesn't see the meal prep as a priority. \n\nIs the husband being reasonable? He's trying to plan ahead and reduce his workload. It's logical that he'd want to minimize stress, especially with kids and work. However, the wife's reaction suggests she might not feel it's fair for her to do all the prep when she's already leaving. Perhaps she expects the husband to step up and handle it, even if it's a challenge. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's request is practical, but he might not have considered his wife's perspective. Did he approach her in a way that makes her feel supported, or did he make it a demand? The wife's reaction could indicate she feels unappreciated or that her efforts are being taken for granted. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about balancing needs and expectations. The husband has a valid concern about managing the kids' meals, but the wife might not feel responsible for continuing her role when she's away. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all, or the husband taking the time to learn the kids' preferences. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It seems more like a miscommunication than a clear fault. He's trying to solve a problem, but his wife's reaction shows she perceives it as an added stress. The issue isn't necessarily that he's wrong, but that both need to communicate better. Since the question is whether he's at fault, the answer leans towards B (he's not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation where both could adjust their approach.\n"
