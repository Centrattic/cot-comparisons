It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband asked his wife to meal prep for the week she's away, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He argues that it's reasonable since she's the one who does most of the cooking and he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's taking on extra responsibilities with the kids and work, and meal prepping would help him. The wife's reaction is that it's too much to ask. But why is she upset? Maybe she's already stressed about the trip, or maybe she feels the request is unfair. \n\nIs the husband's request reasonable? Well, he's asking her to prepare meals in advance for the week. Meal prepping can be time-consuming, and if she's already packing for her trip, adding that might be overwhelming. On the other hand, she's the one who usually handles the cooking, and he's acknowledging his own limitations. \n\nThe key point here is whether the request is unfair. The husband isn't asking for something unreasonable; he's trying to manage the household during her absence. However, the wife's refusal might indicate that she's already under a lot, or maybe she doesn't feel responsible for prep before a trip. \n\nAnother angle: communication. Did they discuss the logistics of her trip beforehand? Maybe the husband didn't consider that she might not have time to prep, especially if she's preparing for a trip. Maybe he should have asked earlier or both could have split the prep work. \n\nBut the husband's intention is to make things easier. He's not trying to dump work on her; he's trying to avoid meltdowns with the kids. However, if she's already overwhelmed, the request might be adding to her stress. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might be dismissive and not helpful, but that's her side. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't in the wrong for asking for help. He's being proactive. The wife's refusal isn't necessarily a sign of wrongdoing on his part. The problem might be more about how the request was made or the wife's capacity to do it. Since he's asking her to do something she normally does, and it's for a week, it's a reasonable request. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's trying to manage household responsibilities and isn't forcing her to do anything beyond what she normally does, just in advance. The wife's reaction is her own issue, but the husband's request is valid.\n"
