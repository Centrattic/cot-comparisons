It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, which will be the first time she's away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling everything himself, including cooking, which the wife usually does. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dynamics here. The husband is taking on a lot of additional responsibility because he's staying home with the kids and working. The wife is going on a trip, so it's reasonable that she might have a different schedule or not be available to help during that week. The main issue is whether asking her to prep meals is too much.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that the kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. He wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. The wife feels that meal prepping is too much work and that he should just handle it with sandwiches. \n\nNow, who is right? Well, the husband is asking for help that would make his already challenging week a bit easier. Since the wife is going away, it's within her capacity to prep meals before she leaves. She might be right that it's a lot of work, but the husband is also taking on significant responsibilities. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong for making a reasonable request? Probably not. He's asking for assistance that's within her means before she leaves, and the trip is something she's initiating. The wife's refusal might stem from feeling overwhelmed, but the request isn't excessive. The key point is that the husband is trying to anticipate a problem (kids' meltdowns) and is seeking a solution that's feasible for the wife to provide. \n\nThe wife might need to consider that her husband is under a lot of pressure and that this request is a way to support him. On the other hand, if the meal prep is genuinely too much for her, maybe they could compromise, like prepping a few days instead of the whole week. But the core issue is whether the request is unfair. Since the wife is the one going on a trip, the responsibility to prepare before leaving seems reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
