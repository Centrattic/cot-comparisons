It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. The situation is that his wife is going on a week-long trip, and he's asking her to meal prep for the week so he can handle the kids and chores alone. She gets upset and says it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles they have in their household. Cooking is normally the wife's responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. The user is asking her to pre-prepare meals so he can manage better. But she's upset and says it's too much. Maybe she feels overwhelmed by the trip itself, and the additional prep makes it harder. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask for meal prep? Well, she's going on a trip, so maybe she's already planning for her own activities. Meal prepping for a week might take time and effort, and if she's stressed about the trip, this could add to her stress. On the other hand, the husband is trying to prepare for his own challenges during her absence. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The husband's intention is to make things easier for himself, but maybe he didn't consider his wife's perspective. Perhaps he should have discussed it earlier or found a compromise. The wife might feel that her partner isn't confident in his ability to handle the kids' meal preferences, which could affect her feelings about his support.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife usually handles cooking, maybe the husband should have taken a different approach, like learning the kids' preferences or finding a middle ground, like prepping some meals that are easy to cook. Alternatively, maybe the wife could have offered to help with another task in exchange for not meal prepping. \n\nBut the husband's main point is that he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food. That's a valid concern, especially since the kids are picky. However, expecting her to prepare all meals might be a bit much. Maybe the husband should have considered other solutions, like having some frozen meals or a backup plan if prepping isn't feasible.\n\nIn the end, it's about balancing both partners' needs. If the wife is already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep might not be fair. The husband might need to find another way to handle the meals without relying solely on her prep. So, maybe the husband is not entirely wrong, but he could have approached it differently. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asking for her help, and she's refusing because it's too much, maybe he's not in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. The answer might be B (No), but with the note that he should consider her perspective more.\n"
