She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The main points are that the wife is going away for a week, it's her first time away from the kids since they were born, and the husband is taking over chores. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and the kids are picky. The husband wants her to prep dinners because he's worried about managing without her. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's reasoning is practical: he wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right. Since the wife knows their preferences better, she's probably the best person to handle meal prep. But the wife feels it's too much work. Is asking her to prep meals unreasonable? Well, she's going on a trip, so maybe she's already busy with packing or other pre-trip tasks. But the trip is for a week, which gives time to prep. However, the wife might also have other responsibilities before leaving, so the husband's request could add stress. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the husband could offer to help with the prep, or they could split the meals. The husband's intention is to make things easier, but the wife's refusal might be due to feeling overwhelmed. Communication is key here. The husband might not be in the wrong because he's trying to plan ahead, but he might not have considered the wife's workload or feelings. However, it's not entirely his fault if the wife wasn't prepared for the request. The wife's reaction might be based on stress or underestimating the prep work. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is asking for help that he might need, and the wife is taking the trip. It's reasonable to ask for some preparation, but the approach matters. The husband's tone could have been more understanding. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the request is reasonable. Given that meal prepping is a common practice for such situations, and the husband has a valid concern about the kids' meals, he's probably not in the wrong. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress, but that doesn't make the husband's request unfair. So the answer is B.\n"
