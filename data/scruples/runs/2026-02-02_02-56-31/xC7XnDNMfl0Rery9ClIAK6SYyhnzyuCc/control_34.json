It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong (AITA). The main issue is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can manage better without her. She's upset about it, saying it's too much work, and he feels it's reasonable since she's going away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's argument is that he's taking over her chores, which include cooking for the kids. The kids are picky, and he's not as familiar with their preferences. Meal prepping would help him avoid stress and potential meltdowns from the kids. His request seems practical given the circumstances. He's asking for something that would make his week easier, especially his first time handling everything alone.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is upset because she finds the request too much work. Maybe she's already preparing for her trip and feels that meal prepping adds to her workload. She might feel that he's not considering her stress or time constraints. Her response about making sandwiches might be a way to say that he should adjust expectations rather than expecting her to do more.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to prepare for a challenging week. But maybe he didn't consider her perspective. Did he communicate his needs clearly, or did he assume she could handle it? The key here is mutual understanding and compromise. If he's making an absolute demand rather than discussing possible solutions together, that could be the issue. However, given that this is her first time away and the kids' well-being is at stake, his request might be reasonable. \n\nBut the problem is that she's upset. Maybe he should have asked earlier or checked in with her about her ability to prep. Alternatively, they could have discussed alternatives, like simpler meals or adjusting the kids' diet temporarily. The fact that she's the one who usually cooks adds another layer. It's natural for the kids to prefer the food she makes, so his request is about consistency.\n\nHowever, if she's already stressed about the trip or has other commitments, asking her to prep meals might be adding to her stress. The husband might not be considering her capacity to do that. It's a balance between his needs and her capacity. Perhaps the issue isn't about right or wrong but about communication and finding a middle ground. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the person is overstepping. The husband is asking for help to manage his responsibilities. But if the wife says it's too much, he should respect that and find another solution. He might not be in the wrong for asking, but maybe in not being flexible when she says no. The answer might depend on whether he's acknowledging her limits and working together. \n\nGiven that he's trying to avoid meltdowns and he's not confident in his ability to cook as well, his request is understandable. But the wife's refusal should be honored. So maybe he's not at fault, but he could have approached it differently. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable, but the wife's feelings are valid. The key is that he's seeking support for a valid reason, and the wife's refusal is her own stress. So the husband's position isn't wrong per se.\n"
