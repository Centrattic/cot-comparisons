It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is usually her responsibility, and he's concerned about the kids' reactions if he can't prepare their usual meals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is trying to prepare for the challenges of managing everything alone. He's not trying to burden his wife with extra work, but he sees her meal prepping as a solution to avoid kitchen meltdowns. On the other hand, the wife feels that prepping a week's worth of meals is too much, especially since she's already going on a trip. She might be overwhelmed or feel it's an unfair request added on top of her trip preparations.\n\nIs the husband's request reasonable? Well, meal prepping for a week might be time-consuming. If the wife is already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep could be an extra burden. But the husband's intention is to manage the situation better at home. The key here is balance. Was the request communicated clearly? Did the husband consider her workload? He mentioned she's going to be away, so maybe he should have checked if she could manage it given her existing tasks.\n\nThe wife's reaction might be due to feeling overwhelmed. The husband's alternative suggestion of sandwiches seems dismissive of her concerns. Maybe she feels her efforts aren't respected. Also, if cooking is her responsibility, expecting her to prep meals even when she's not there might be shifting the responsibility unfairly, but he's asking her to do it before she leaves, so it's about future preparation.\n\nIn terms of fairness, he's not making her do it while she's away, just before. But the act of prepping a week's meals can be a lot. If the wife says it's too much work, the husband might need to find a middle ground. However, he's not wrong for trying to prepare. The question is whether his request is reasonable. Since he's not making her do it while she's away and it's to make his week easier, it's a valid concern. But if he's not considering her capacity, maybe he's not wrong, but perhaps could have approached it differently.\n\nOverall, the husband isn't in the wrong for making a reasonable request to ease his burden during her absence. The wife's refusal is valid if she can't handle it, but the husband's intent is to manage the situation better. So the answer is B.\n"
