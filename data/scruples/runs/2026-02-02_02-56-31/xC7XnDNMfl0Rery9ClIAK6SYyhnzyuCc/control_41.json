She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is asking her to prep dinners so he can handle the kids and chores alone. She got upset because she thinks it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is going on her first extended trip away from the kids, and the husband is taking over her responsibilities. Cooking is her main role, and the kids are picky. He wants consistency for the kids, so he asks her to prep meals. She feels it's too much.\n\nIs the husband being reasonable? He's acknowledging that he can do it, but he's worried about the kids' reactions. It's understandable that he wants to make the transition easier. However, the wife is going away, which is a personal time for her. Asking her to prep meals might be adding extra stress before her trip. But he's also managing a lot at home without her. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The husband's request is practical, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings about the extra work. She might feel overwhelmed, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. The husband's intention is to ease his own burden and the kids' adjustment. \n\nIs it fair to ask her? It depends on their usual dynamics. If she usually handles cooking, maybe it's reasonable to expect her to help set things up for her absence. But he should also consider her capacity. Maybe he should have offered to split the prep work or discussed it more to find a middle ground. \n\nThe wife's response seems a bit dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, which might not be ideal for the kids. The husband's concern about meltdowns is valid. However, he might need to compromise, like prepping some meals and being flexible with others. \n\nOverall, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking, but perhaps he could have approached it differently. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife is the one getting upset and refusing, the husband's request seems reasonable given the circumstances. He's trying to manage a challenging week alone. So the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
