She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author's wife is going on a week-long trip. It's her first time away from the kids since they were born, so the author will be handling all the responsibilities alone, including the chores and cooking. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife usually cooks, so she knows their preferences better. The author asked her to prep meals for the week before she leaves, but she got upset, saying that's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it gets too hard. The author feels it's reasonable to ask because she's the one going on the trip and he wants to avoid mealtime meltdowns.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are:\n\n1. The wife is going away for a week, which is a significant time away from the kids.\n2. The author is taking on all the responsibilities, including cooking, which he's not as familiar with.\n3. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better.\n4. The author asked her to prep meals, which she found too much work and declined.\n5. The author feels it's fair because she's the one leaving, but she disagrees.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help to make things easier during a time when he's taking on more. But why is the wife upset? Maybe the prep work is time-consuming or adds stress before her trip. She might feel that since she's the one going away, she's already dealing with the trip's stress and doesn't want to add more tasks. Alternatively, she might feel that the author isn't pulling his weight or that the request is unfair given the timing.\n\nOn the author's side, he's trying to manage without the wife's help and wants to avoid issues with the kids. Since the wife is more experienced in cooking, her prepping could prevent problems. But is it reasonable to expect her to do the prep right before her trip? Maybe she's worried about the time and energy required, especially if the trip is already stressful. The author might not consider the burden of the prep, assuming she can do it easily.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the request is unreasonable. The author has a valid reason, but the wife's refusal suggests that the request might be too much. However, since the wife is the one going away, she might have the time to prep before leaving, making it a reasonable ask. On the other hand, if prepping is too much for her, maybe there's a middle ground. The author could have offered to help with the prep or suggested a different solution. But in this case, he just asked her, and she declined.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's trying to manage his responsibilities. However, the wife's reaction might indicate that the request was too much. But since the author is asking here, perhaps he's not in the wrong because he's trying to find support, but the wife's refusal might be valid too. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the answer is B (No), because the author's request is reasonable given the circumstances, even if the wife found it burdensome.\n"
