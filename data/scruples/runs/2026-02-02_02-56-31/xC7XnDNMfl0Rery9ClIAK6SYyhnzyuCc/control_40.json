It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who asked their wife to meal prep before her trip is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling the chores and cooking, which the wife usually does. The kids are picky eaters, and the husband isn't as familiar with their preferences. So he asked her to prep the dinners for the week. She got upset and said it's too much, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether the husband's request was reasonable. He's taking on a lot more responsibility with the kids, which is understandable. Cooking for picky kids is challenging, especially if he's not used to it. Meal prepping could reduce stress for him. But the wife is going on a trip, which is a significant event. She might be dealing with her own stress or planning for the trip, so adding meal prep might be overwhelming for her. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's intention is to make things easier for himself, which is valid. However, the wife's reaction suggests that the request might have been burdensome for her. Maybe they didn't discuss the logistics well. The husband could have considered her perspective\u2014how much time she has before the trip, her ability to prep, and whether there's a compromise. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help to manage his increased workload. That's not inherently wrong. But if the way he asked her wasn't considerate of her capacity, maybe there's room for improvement. The wife's response indicates that the request was too much, so maybe the husband didn't account for her current situation or stress levels. However, it's also possible that the wife could have negotiated the request instead of getting upset. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a bit of a balance. Both partners have responsibilities, and in times when one is away, the other might need to adjust. The husband isn't asking for something unreasonable, but the timing and the wife's capacity are factors. The answer might depend on how the request was framed. If he approached it as a collaborative effort rather than a demand, maybe the outcome would be different. \n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to ask for help, but the way he communicated it might have caused tension. The wife's reaction is also valid if she felt overwhelmed. The main issue here is the lack of effective communication and mutual consideration of each other's pressures. Therefore, the answer might be a bit nuanced. However, since the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No) because his request is reasonable given the circumstances, but the wife's response is also valid. The husband isn't in the wrong for making the request, but both could benefit from better communication.\n"
