It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife going on a trip and the husband asking her to do meal prep for the week. The husband is concerned about managing the kids and chores alone, especially since cooking is usually the wife's responsibility and she knows the kids' preferences better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request seems reasonable because he's asking for help to make things easier during a time when he's taking on extra responsibilities. Meal prepping could save him time and reduce stress, especially with picky eaters. On the other hand, the wife thinks it's too much work and is upset by the request. Maybe she's already stressed about her trip or feels that the request is unfair given her own preparations.\n\nBut the key points here are the context: this is the first time the husband is handling everything alone, the kids are picky, and the wife usually handles cooking. The husband isn't asking her to do something she isn't already responsible for; he's asking her to prepare in advance for a situation where he'll need more support. It's about shared responsibility and practicality. The wife's refusal might stem from not wanting to add to her pre-trip workload, but the husband's request is aimed at making the transition smoother for everyone, including the kids.\n\nAlso, the wife's alternative suggestion of making sandwiches might not be ideal since the kids are used to different meals. The husband's concern about meltdowns is valid. The question is whether the request is unreasonable. Since the wife is going on the trip, it's a temporary request, not a long-term shift. So the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to plan ahead and ensure things run smoothly.\n"
