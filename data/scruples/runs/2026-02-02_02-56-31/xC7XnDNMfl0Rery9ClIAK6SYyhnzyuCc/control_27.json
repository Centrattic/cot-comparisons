It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle cooking for their kids while she's away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is going on her first trip without the kids, and the husband is taking over her chores. Cooking is her responsibility, and the kids are picky. The husband's request is reasonable because he's worried about the kids' reactions if the food isn't as they expect. He's asking her to prep meals for the week to make his job easier.\n\nThe wife got upset and said it's too much work. She suggests he can make sandwiches instead. The husband feels it's unfair to ask her, but the wife disagrees. The key points here are about expectations, communication, and fairness.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help to manage a challenging week. Since meal prepping is part of the wife's usual duties, it's logical for her to prepare. However, she's the one going away, and maybe the husband didn't consider that she might feel burdened by the request. But the husband is just trying to prepare for a situation he's not used to handling alone. The wife could have been more understanding or offered alternative solutions. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the husband isn't wrong for seeking assistance. He's not making her do something unreasonable\u2014just prepping meals for the week. The wife's refusal might stem from stress about the trip itself, but the husband's request is practical. The problem might be more about communication. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the husband's actions seem justified. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
