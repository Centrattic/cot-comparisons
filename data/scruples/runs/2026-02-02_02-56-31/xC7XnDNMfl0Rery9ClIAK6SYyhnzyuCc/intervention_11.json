It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that she's going away for a week, which is the first time she's left the kids since they were born. The user is handling all the chores and cooking, which he says is usually her responsibility. He asked her to prep meals for the week because the kids are picky and he's less familiar with their preferences. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if he's being reasonable. He's taking on a lot by handling everything alone. Since cooking is her usual role, it makes sense he might feel she's better equipped to handle the meal prep. But she's going on a trip, which is a work or personal commitment, so maybe he's asking her to do extra work before leaving. Is that fair?\n\nHe's trying to avoid meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right. That's a valid concern, especially with picky eaters. However, she's already stressed about the trip, and he's adding another task. Maybe he didn't consider that she might not want to take on more work before her trip, even if it's for the kids' benefit. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to manage his own workload and ensure the kids' needs are met. The question is whether his request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week isn't trivial, but maybe she has the capacity to do it. However, if she's already feeling overwhelmed with packing and preparing for her trip, adding meal prep might be too much. \n\nIt depends on communication. Did he check with her about her capacity before making the request? If he assumed she could do it without considering her stress, that might be part of the issue. Alternatively, if he communicated his need and she still refused, maybe he's not in the wrong for trying to plan ahead. \n\nAlso, considering that she's allowing him to make sandwiches if needed, maybe she's trying to be helpful but doesn't want to commit to the meal prep. The user's intention is good, but the approach might not have been considerate of her feelings. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting responsibilities is normal, but when someone is going away, expecting them to do extra might be a point of contention. The user might be overstepping by not offering to take over more or by not considering her perspective. \n\nSo, the answer could be that he's not entirely in the wrong, but he could have approached the situation differently. However, since the options are A (yes) or B (no), and the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer would likely be B, No, because his intention is to manage the kids' needs, but he might need to adjust his approach. However, there's a nuance here. If the wife is already stressed about the trip, maybe he should have been more understanding. But the core question is whether he's in the wrong, and the answer is B.\n"
