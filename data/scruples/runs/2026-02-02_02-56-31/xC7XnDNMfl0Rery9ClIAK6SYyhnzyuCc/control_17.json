It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to prep meals ahead of time because he's worried about managing the kids and chores alone. The wife gets upset, saying it's too much work, and suggests he can just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main concern is that he's not as familiar with the kids' picky eating habits as the wife is. He wants to avoid meltdowns by having the meals prepped. The wife, on the other hand, feels that preparing meals for the week is excessive and stressful for her before her trip. She offers an alternative (sandwiches) which is simpler but maybe not as satisfying for the kids.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for asking. He's asking for help to manage a situation that's going to be challenging for him. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable, just to preplan meals. However, the wife is feeling overwhelmed. Maybe the timing isn't great if she's already stressed about her trip. But the husband's request is practical. \n\nI should check if there's any assumption here. The husband might be assuming that the wife has the capacity and time to prep, but if she's already stressed, asking her to do more could be adding to her burden. However, the premise is that it's her trip, so she might have the time before leaving. But maybe she's already packed and has other tasks. \n\nAlso, the wife's offer to make sandwiches is a solution, but the husband might prefer not to rely on that because it's not as good for the kids. The key here is whether his request is fair. Since it's her first time away, maybe he's entitled to ask for help. But if she's already overloaded, it's not fair to add more. The answer depends on the context of their relationship and how they usually handle responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is going away, it's reasonable to expect her to prepare as much as possible to make the transition easier. However, if she's already stressed, the husband could have offered to help with some prep instead of just asking her to do it all. But he did ask, and she refused. The issue is whether his request was within reason. Since he's not asking her to stay and help, just to prep before she goes, it seems reasonable. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
