It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, first time away from the kids. The husband has to take over her chores, including cooking. The kids are picky, and he's not as confident in cooking as his wife. He asked her to prep dinners, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. He thinks it's fair because she's the one leaving.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The husband is trying to manage without his wife, but she's not willing to help. The wife might feel like preparing meals for the entire week is an extra burden on top of her trip prep. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip, and adding meal prep is too much. But the husband is worried about the kids' reactions if he can't cook as well.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband is reasonable in wanting to avoid problems with the kids. He's not asking her to do something that's not related to the trip\u2014since she's leaving, maybe he's expecting her to help set him up for success. But is it fair to ask her to do the meal prep when she's already preparing for her trip? Maybe she has other commitments or feels it's not her responsibility. \n\nAlso, the wife's response of offering sandwiches might be a cop-out. But why did she get upset? Maybe she feels resentful that he's assigning her more work when she's about to leave. Or perhaps she thinks he should handle it himself since he's staying. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband might have assumed that since she's the primary cook, she can help by prepping. But the wife might see it as an additional task that he should manage without her. It's possible that the husband didn't consider her workload or that she's already preparing for her trip. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's asking for help that's reasonable and within her capability, but she's refusing without considering his needs, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he didn't consider her perspective or the added stress of her trip, he might be overstepping. \n\nI think the answer depends on the balance. The husband is trying to make things easier, but the wife's refusal might be valid if the prep is too much. However, since cooking is her responsibility, asking her to help is reasonable. But she might be overwhelmed. Maybe he should have discussed it earlier or offered to help with the prep. But as it stands, he's not in the wrong for wanting the help, but there's a communication issue. So the answer is B (No).\n"
