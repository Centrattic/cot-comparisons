It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, which is the first time the kids have been without her since birth. The user is handling all the chores and cooking, which is normally the wife's job. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. The user asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the user's reasoning is that since the wife is leaving, she should help by prepping meals to make it easier. But the wife feels it's too much. The user is trying to avoid the kids' meltdowns from unfamiliar food. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the user is taking on a lot of extra work with the kids and chores. On the other, the wife is about to go on a trip and might be stressed. Meal prepping could be a lot, but the user argues that the wife knows the kids' preferences better. \n\nIs it unreasonable to ask her to prep meals before a trip? Well, if she's going away, maybe she has other things to prepare for. But she's the one who usually handles the cooking, so maybe it makes sense that she would prep ahead. However, the wife might feel that the user should take responsibility now that she's away. There's a balance between shared responsibilities and understanding each other's burdens. \n\nThe user isn't forcing her; he's asking. She refused, feeling it's too much. Maybe the user didn't consider how much work it might be for her. However, his intention is practical\u2014to avoid problems with the kids. \n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. But in general, if both parties are trying to communicate and the user isn't being unreasonable, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the wife is already overwhelmed, maybe he should have found another solution. However, since it's her responsibility normally, asking her to prep isn't inherently wrong. So probably answer B.\n"
