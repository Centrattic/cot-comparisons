      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. So the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time she's been away since the kids were born. The husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he can just make sandwiches if needed. The husband feels it's not unfair since she's taking the week off.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are about fairness, expectations in a relationship, and mutual support. The husband is asking for help because he's taking on more responsibility during her absence. But the wife is already going on a trip, which might be a time for her to recharge or have some personal time. \n\nFirst, is it reasonable to ask a spouse to prepare meals before a trip? Well, if it's part of the normal responsibilities and they've been sharing duties, maybe. But the wife is going away, so maybe she's not in the best position to do prep work. Also, she might feel that the request is adding extra pressure on top of her trip preparations. \n\nThe husband's argument is that he needs the help because he's not as experienced with the kids' meals. That's understandable. But the wife might feel that being away is her time to relax, and preparing meals for a week is a lot of work. She might also feel that the husband should be able to handle it, even if it's a bit of a challenge, since it's temporary. \n\nAnother angle is communication. Did they discuss this beforehand? If they usually have a shared routine, maybe the husband should have taken that into account. But the husband is trying to preempt a problem, which is logical. However, the wife's reaction suggests that she feels the request is burdensome. \n\nIs it unfair to ask her to prep when she's already going on a trip? Maybe. If the trip is something she needed to take, perhaps the husband should adjust without additional help from her. On the other hand, if they've always shared responsibilities, he might expect her to do that. But she's not there to do the prep physically, so maybe she's right in that it's too much work. \n\nThe husband's alternative of making sandwiches might not be ideal, but it's a solution. The wife is suggesting that if it's too hard, he can do that. So maybe the husband is overreacting by expecting her to do the prep when she's already going on a trip. \n\nIn relationships, there's a balance of support. If the wife is taking time for herself, the husband needs to step up. But the husband is also trying to manage his responsibilities. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the wife's refusal might indicate that the request was too much, considering her being on a trip. So maybe the author is not in the wrong, but perhaps the answer is B, No. Wait, but maybe he is in the wrong because he's expecting her to take on extra work when she's already leaving. So the answer could be A. \n\nWait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author asked her and she said no, then he's not at fault for making the request, but maybe the wife is right in refusing. But the author's reasoning is that it's fair to ask her because she's going away. But maybe it's not fair because she's not there to do the prep. So the author is in the wrong because he's asking for something that's impractical. Alternatively, if the wife can prep before the trip, maybe it's reasonable. \n\nThe situation is complicated. The answer likely depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If they've always shared responsibilities, maybe the author isn't wrong. But if the wife is already going on a trip, maybe the author should adjust without her. The key is whether the request is reasonable. Since she's not there during the trip, maybe the author is in the wrong for asking her to prep when she's away. So answer A. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check again.\n\nThe author's main point is that the kids are picky, and he wants to avoid meltdowns. He's asking her to prep before the trip. The wife is upset because it's too much work. The author thinks it's fair because she's taking the week off. The wife's response suggests she's not willing to take on that extra work. \n\nIn that case, maybe the author is not wrong because he's trying to manage his responsibilities. But maybe he's wrong because he's expecting her to do the prep when she's not there. So maybe the answer is B, No. Wait, but if she's not there, how can she prep? Unless she's prepping before leaving. If she's prepping meals before the trip, that's possible. But if she's not there during the week, the prep would have to be done before she leaves. If she's willing, that's okay. But she's refusing because it's too much work. So the author is not in the wrong for asking, but the wife is in her right to refuse. So the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong for not considering her workload. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author is not in the wrong because he's trying to prepare and reduce stress, and the wife's refusal is her choice. The author isn't at fault for making a reasonable request, even if she disagrees.\n"
