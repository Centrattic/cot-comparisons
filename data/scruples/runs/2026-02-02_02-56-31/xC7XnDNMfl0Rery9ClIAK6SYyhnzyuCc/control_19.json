It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The key points here are that the wife is going on her first trip without the kids, the husband is worried about managing both work and the house, and cooking is the wife's usual responsibility. The kids are picky, so the husband wants prepped meals to avoid meltdowns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's asking his wife to prepare meals in advance, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. He's taking on extra responsibilities during her absence, and having prepped meals would ease the burden. It's logical for him to ask her to do something she's already responsible for, especially since she knows the kids' preferences better.\n\nHowever, the wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work. Maybe she's feeling like she's being asked to do extra just because she's the one who usually handles it. There's a possibility that the husband is placing an undue burden on her right before her trip, but the main argument is that he's asking her to do what she already does, just in advance. \n\nThe husband's request isn't unreasonable. He's not asking her to do more than her usual role; he's just asking her to prepare in advance for a week. The wife's refusal might be based on the timing being stressful for her, but the husband's need for stability at home is also valid. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband might have explained his stress and the reason behind the request, but if he didn't, that could contribute to the wife feeling it's too much. However, the core issue is about shared responsibilities and preparing for a temporary change in routine.\n\nConsidering all this, the husband's request seems reasonable. The wife might be overreacting because she's under stress about her trip or not considering his situation. The husband isn't wrong for wanting to make things easier by leveraging her existing role. So, the answer is B (the husband is not in the wrong).\n"
