It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that his wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is taking a week off, which is her first time away since the kids were born. That's a big deal, and maybe she's feeling overwhelmed. The husband needs help, but his request might be seen as adding more work before her trip. However, his intention is to manage the kids' needs better. \n\nHe mentions that the wife knows the kids' preferences better, so meal prepping would help. But she finds it too much work and suggests making sandwiches instead. The question is whether his request is unfair. \n\nFrom his perspective, he's trying to prepare for a challenging week. But from her side, maybe the prep is an extra burden when she's already preparing to leave. It's possible he didn't consider that she might be stressed about the trip and the prep. \n\nHowever, he's not wrong in wanting to make things easier. He's aware of his limitations and the kids' needs. But maybe he should have discussed it earlier or considered alternative solutions. \n\nIn terms of fairness, asking her to prep might be reasonable, but the way he asked or the timing could be an issue. The key is mutual understanding. He's not wrong, but there's room for better communication. So the answer is B.\n"
