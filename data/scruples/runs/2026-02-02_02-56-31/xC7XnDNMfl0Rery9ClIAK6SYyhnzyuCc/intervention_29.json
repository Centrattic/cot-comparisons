She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, their first time apart since the kids were born. The user is worried about handling the chores and cooking, which the wife usually does. He asked her to prep dinners for the week so it's easier for him. She got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested he could just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's reasoning is that he's taking over the chores and cooking, which he's not as used to. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their food preferences better. He wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual meals. He thinks it's fair to ask her to prep since she's the one leaving. But the wife feels it's too much work on top of her trip prep. \n\nI should think about relationship dynamics. In a partnership, sharing responsibilities is important. The user is trying to manage the household during her absence, which makes sense. However, the wife might feel overwhelmed if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's dealing with her own stress, and the meal prep adds to that. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could have discussed the request earlier to plan better. But the user didn't mention that. The key points are: his need for support vs. her capacity to provide it. If the request is reasonable and feasible, he's not in the wrong. But if the wife has valid reasons for not being able to do it, maybe he is overstepping. However, since she's going on a trip, maybe the user should have considered that she's busy with her own travel prep. \n\nBut the user's intent is to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. He's not making her do it; he's just suggesting it. She refused, but maybe he should have offered to help with her travel prep in exchange or found another solution. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's reaction might be a bit harsh if the user's request is reasonable. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the user asked politely and the wife feels it's too much, maybe a compromise is needed. But the user isn't in the wrong just for asking. He's trying to manage the situation. The wife's refusal is her own choice, but he's not wrong for making a reasonable request. So the answer is probably B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
