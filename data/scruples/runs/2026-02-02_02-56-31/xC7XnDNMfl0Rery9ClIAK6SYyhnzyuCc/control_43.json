It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The context is that the wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, so the husband will have to handle all the chores and cooking alone. He's asking her to prepare meals for the week because he's not as comfortable with the kids' picky eating habits. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work and offers to just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, the husband's request seems reasonable. He's acknowledging that his wife knows the kids' food preferences better, so asking her to prep meals makes sense. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable; meal prepping is a common way to help someone out. The wife's reaction might be about the extra work, but the husband is trying to be proactive to avoid problems during her absence.\n\nHowever, the wife might feel that the request is an added burden, especially if she's already stressed about the trip or has other preparations to do. The key here is whether the request is fair. The husband is asking for help to manage a situation he's not confident in handling on his own. The wife's alternative of sandwiches is a compromise, but the husband prefers the meals she usually does to prevent meltdowns. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Since he's trying to make things easier for himself and the kids, and the request is within the scope of what a partner might reasonably ask before a trip, it seems like he's not at fault. The wife's refusal could be due to the workload, but that doesn't necessarily make the husband wrong for asking. So the answer is B.\n"
