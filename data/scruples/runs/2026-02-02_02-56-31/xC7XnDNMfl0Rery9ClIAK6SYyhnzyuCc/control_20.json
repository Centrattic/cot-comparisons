It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the author wants her to meal prep for the week. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work. The author argues that since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better, prepping meals would make things easier for him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is asking for help because they're overwhelmed with the kids and work. It's their first time managing alone, so the stress is understandable. The wife, on the other hand, is already going on a trip, which might be a chance for her to take a break. She might feel that preparing meals for a week adds extra work before she can relax. \n\nIs it unfair to ask her to prep? Well, if she's the one who usually cooks and knows the kids' preferences, maybe the author is trying to set up a system that works best for everyone. But the wife might see it as being asked to do more work when she's about to leave. Maybe she's stressed about the trip or has her own reasons for not wanting to prep. \n\nI should also think about communication. Did they discuss this beforehand? The author mentions the kids are picky and that they need consistency. The wife's response was to say it's too much and suggest sandwiches, which might not be ideal. But maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like prepping only a few meals instead of all. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to manage the household while the wife is away. Since the wife will be gone, she's not there to cook. If she's willing to take the trip but not to prepare meals, that could create a problem. However, maybe there's a misunderstanding about the actual time and effort required for meal prepping. \n\nI think the key points are: the author's need for help, the wife's possible stress about the trip, and whether the request is reasonable. The author isn't asking her to do something she's not responsible for; they're just asking for her to take on a task she already does. But since she's going away, maybe the timing is bad. \n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong because they're asking for help in a situation where they're taking on more responsibilities. The wife might need to consider that her absence will require some preparation. However, the author should also consider her feelings and maybe find a compromise. But the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is trying to plan and reduce stress, I think the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
