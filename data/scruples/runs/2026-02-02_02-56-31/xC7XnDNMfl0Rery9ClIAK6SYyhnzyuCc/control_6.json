It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the husband is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The key points here are the context of their situation and the wife's reaction.\n\nFirst, the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband is worried about handling the kids, work, and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals so he doesn't have to handle it during the trip. She got upset, saying it's too much work and offered sandwiches instead.\n\nNow, considering their shared responsibilities: if cooking is her usual role, maybe the husband is acknowledging her expertise. He's trying to make it manageable for himself while she's away. But she's stressed about the prep work. Is it unreasonable to ask her to do it? Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or other duties. The husband's intention is to avoid kid meltdowns from different food, which is valid. However, the wife's refusal might stem from her own capacity. \n\nIs the husband being selfish by expecting her to do this before her trip? Or is it reasonable to ask her to prepare now, before she leaves? If the trip is upcoming, meal prepping in advance could help both of them. But if she's already overwhelmed with packing or other tasks, that might add stress. \n\nAlso, the husband could consider alternatives, like using frozen meals or involving the kids in simple cooking, but he's concerned about their preferences. The wife's suggestion of sandwiches is a compromise, but the husband might not prefer that. The main question is whether his request is fair, given that she's leaving. Since he's taking over her responsibilities, he has a right to ask for help in making the transition smoother. However, if her workload is too much, maybe he should adjust. \n\nThe answer hinges on mutual understanding. The husband's request is practical, but the wife's refusal might be valid if she's overburdened. But since the trip is her time away, maybe the husband should adapt. However, given the context, the husband isn't being unreasonable. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
