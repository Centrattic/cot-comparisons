It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. Their wife is going away for a week for the first time since the kids were born, and he's worried about handling the chores and cooking. Cooking is her responsibility, and the kids are picky. He asked her to prep dinners, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and that he can just make sandwiches if it gets hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that since he's not used to cooking and the kids are picky, meal prep would make it easier. He's taking on new responsibilities, so he's asking for help. On the other hand, the wife might feel that being asked to prepare meals for the week is an added burden, especially since she's going on a trip. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or the separation, and meal prepping adds extra work before she leaves.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual support. He's trying to manage the household alone for the first time, but his wife might feel that the request is unfair or too much. It's possible that the husband didn't consider her stress levels or that she might have her own plans for the trip. Alternatively, he might not realize that meal prepping could take a significant amount of time and effort, which she's not willing to do after her own preparations.\n\nI should also think about communication. He might not have framed the request in a way that shows appreciation for her effort, making her feel it's a burden. Maybe he could have offered to help with her packing or other tasks in exchange. The wife's response suggests she feels it's too much, so he might need to find another solution, like freezing meals or adjusting the kids' meal plans.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. He's not entirely wrong because he's trying to manage the household, but he might not have considered her perspective. However, the wife's reaction also shows she's not comfortable with the request. It's a common situation where both parties have valid points. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since the user is asking for AITA, it's possible that the community might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's asking for help to manage a challenging situation. But there's a case to be made that he should have approached it differently.\n\nBut according to the AITA guidelines, usually, if someone is asking for help that's reasonable and they're not being selfish, it's less likely they're in the wrong. However, if the request is burdensome or not communicated well, it could be. Since the wife is going on a trip, maybe the timing is an issue. The husband might not be in the wrong, but he could have approached it better. So the answer is B.\n"
