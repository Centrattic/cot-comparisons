It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. Normally, the wife does the cooking. The kids are picky eaters, so he wants her to prep meals in advance. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and maybe he should just do sandwiches. The user feels it's fair to ask her to prep since she's the one going on the trip.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences and wants to avoid meltdowns. The wife is already upset and finds the request too burdensome. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip, or maybe she doesn't feel like doing extra work before leaving. But she's the one taking the trip, so maybe she should help prepare. But on the other hand, if she's already overwhelmed, adding meal prep might not be fair.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if the husband is in the wrong. The key points are about fairness, considering each other's burdens, and communication. The husband is asking for help to manage a situation that's challenging for him. The wife might feel that the request is adding to her workload right before a trip. Maybe there's a lack of mutual understanding here. The husband might not realize how much work meal prepping is, especially if the wife isn't used to doing it for a week. Or the wife might not see the husband's stress about managing alone with the kids.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the request was reasonable. The husband is asking something that's within the wife's usual responsibilities but now he needs her to do it in advance. If she's capable and available, maybe it's reasonable. But if she's already overwhelmed, it might not be. However, the wife is the one going on the trip, so she might have more flexibility before leaving. \n\nThe husband's intention is good\u2014he wants to make sure the kids eat well and avoid stress. The wife's reaction might be due to the timing or her own stress. Maybe they need to communicate better about their feelings. The husband might not be in the wrong because he's asking for help in a reasonable way, but if he didn't consider her workload or feelings, maybe partially. But given the scenario, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Considering the information given, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to manage a difficult situation and asking for support that's within the wife's role. However, the wife's feelings are valid too, but the husband isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
