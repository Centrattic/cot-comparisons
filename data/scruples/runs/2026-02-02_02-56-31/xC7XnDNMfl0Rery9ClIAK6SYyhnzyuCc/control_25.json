It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and since the kids are picky, he wants her to prep dinners so it's easier for him. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's hard. The author thinks it's unfair not to ask her since she's going away.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about dividing responsibilities and understanding each other's perspectives. The husband is trying to plan ahead to avoid stress during her absence. The wife might feel that the request is adding extra work to her trip prep, which is already a big deal since it's her first time away. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself and the added task of meal prepping is too much. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences, so prepping meals would prevent meltdowns. But the wife's response suggests she finds the request burdensome. Is the husband overstepping by asking for prep work? It's a common issue in relationships where expectations about shared responsibilities can clash.\n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to manage the household during her absence. It's reasonable to ask her to help in a way that's best for the kids. However, maybe the wife feels that her own plans are being disrupted. But the husband is trying to avoid problems, and since the wife is going away, it's logical to ask her to prepare. The wife's refusal might be a valid response if the prep is too much for her, but that doesn't necessarily mean the husband is wrong. It's more about communication and compromise. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
