It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores. Cooking is usually the wife's job, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he could just do sandwiches instead.\n\nHmm. The user's reasoning is that it's not unfair because the wife is going on a week trip and she's responsible for cooking. The wife is upset because she finds it too much work. So, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for making that request.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband is trying to prepare for a situation where he's taking over more responsibilities. He's asking her to do something that would make his week easier. But the wife is already going to be away, so maybe she's already stressed about her trip, or maybe she's overwhelmed with the extra work. If she's going away, perhaps she's already planning to prep things, but if she says it's too much, maybe she's right to feel that way.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intention is to avoid meltdowns with the kids over unfamiliar food. He's not forcing her to do it, but he's making a request. If she's refusing because it's too much work, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's asking for help in advance. But maybe he should have considered that she might be busy with her trip preparations and that prepping meals could add to her stress. There's a balance between reasonable requests and recognizing that a week away might already require her to manage a lot.\n\nHe could have also offered to help with meal prepping, or maybe they could split the task. But the key point here is whether the request is fair. Meal prepping for a week is a significant task, and if the wife is already going on a trip, maybe she's not in the best position to handle that. The husband might be assuming that she can handle it, but if she's clearly saying it's too much, then maybe he needs to find another solution. However, his intention is to make things easier for himself, not to burden her.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. The husband isn't forcing her to do it, just asking. If she's unable to do it because of the workload, then he's not in the wrong for asking, but he might need to adjust his expectations. Alternatively, if she's already planning to take that week off, expecting her to prep meals might be asking for more than she's willing to do. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to prepare and the request is reasonable, but maybe there's a need for better communication. However, the wife's reaction suggests that maybe the request was too much for her. But the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Since he's trying to plan and the request is practical, and he's not forcing her but asking, the answer is B.\n"
