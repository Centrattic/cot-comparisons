She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep for the week she's away. The wife gets upset and refuses, suggesting he just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband is asking for prepped meals because he's taking over her chores, including cooking, which he's less familiar with. His kids are picky, so he wants consistency. The wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, and he's worried about handling everything alone. She feels it's too much work and is upset about being asked. \n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's asking for help to manage a stressful week. He's not making her do something unreasonable; he's asking her to prep meals so he doesn't have to do it all on his own. He's also considering the kids' preferences, which are better known by her. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is an extra burden on top of her trip prep. Maybe she's already stressed about leaving and being asked to do meal prep adds pressure. Or perhaps she feels her husband should handle it himself since he's the one staying home. It's possible there's a lack of communication or differing expectations about responsibilities during her absence.\n\nBut the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Is it unfair to ask her to prep meals? Well, he's not making her do it; he's just asking. Since she's going away, maybe he's being proactive. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed or maybe she's not comfortable with the idea. However, the husband's request seems reasonable. He's not forcing her, just asking for help. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife feels that the husband should take more initiative in learning how to cook for the kids rather than expecting her to do it even when she's away. But the husband argues that he's less familiar with the kids' preferences. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a common issue in relationships where one partner expects the other to take on tasks. The husband is trying to balance his workload. The wife's refusal could be due to various reasons, but the husband isn't necessarily wrong for asking. He's seeking support during a challenging time. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). He's making a reasonable request to ease a difficult week. The wife's upset reaction is her own response, but the husband isn't wrong for asking.\n"
