It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born, and the husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking alone. The wife got upset because she thinks it's too much work and suggested just making sandwiches if it gets hard.\n\nHmm, the husband's request seems reasonable. He wants to make sure the kids have meals they're used to because they're picky. He's taking on her half of the chores, so meal prepping could help him manage. But the wife is upset, maybe because she's already stressed or doesn't want to take on extra work before her trip. The key here is whether the request is fair. Since she's going away and he's handling her responsibilities, asking her to prepare meals in advance to ease the transition is understandable. It's not like he's asking her to cook while she's on the trip; he's asking her to do it before she leaves. So maybe not in the wrong. But I should check if there's any cultural context or expectations I'm missing. Typically, when someone is going away, they might help out by preparing some things in advance. The wife's reaction might be about the volume of work or not wanting to feel like she's not trusted to handle it. But the husband's intention is to reduce his own stress and avoid kid meltdowns. It seems like a practical request. So probably answer B, No.\n"
