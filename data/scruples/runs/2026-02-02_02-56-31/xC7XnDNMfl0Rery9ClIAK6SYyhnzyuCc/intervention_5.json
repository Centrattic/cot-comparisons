It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The user is handling all the chores and cooking alone. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better. The user asked her to prep meals for the week to make things easier. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested sandwiches if needed. The user feels it's not unfair since the wife is taking the trip.\n\nHmm, so the user's reasoning is practical: they need help because the kids are picky, and the wife's knowledge is crucial. The wife's reaction is unexpected. Maybe she feels the request is unreasonable, perhaps because she's already stressed about the trip or feels it's unfair. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the user is trying to manage the household alone, and the wife's meal prep would help. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the user isn't taking on enough responsibility or that the request is too much added to her pre-trip stress. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, asking for help isn't inherently wrong. The user has a valid reason. The issue might be communication. Maybe the user should have offered to cover some of her usual chores to make it fairer. But given the situation, the user's request is reasonable. The wife's reaction might be due to stress or feeling overwhelmed. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
