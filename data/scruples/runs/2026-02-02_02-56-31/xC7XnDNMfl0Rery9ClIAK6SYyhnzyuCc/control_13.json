It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that his wife is going on a week-long trip, and he asked her to meal prep for the kids during her absence. She got upset and refused, saying it's too much work. He's arguing that it's fair since she's leaving, and he's worried about handling picky eaters alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that since cooking is his wife's responsibility and she knows the kids' preferences better, prepping meals would help him manage without her. He's handling chores, work, and kids alone, so asking for some support makes sense. On the other hand, the wife is taking a trip, which is a form of self-care or necessary work, and might feel that being asked to prep meals adds extra stress before her trip. She might be overwhelmed or have other commitments.\n\nIs the husband inconsiderate? Well, he's trying to plan ahead to avoid meltdowns. But maybe he didn't consider her workload before the trip. Maybe the prep work is too much for her right before leaving. The key point is communication. Did he discuss this with her in a way that considered her feelings? If he just asked without considering her stress levels, that could be an issue. Alternatively, if he had a conversation where they both agreed on how to split responsibilities, it might be different.\n\nAlso, the wife's response that she can't do it and suggests making sandwiches could indicate that she's already stretched thin. The husband might need to find another solution, like simplifying meals or using frozen options. But the question is whether he's in the wrong here. If he's making a reasonable request based on their usual roles, he's not necessarily wrong. However, if he's being rigid and not considering her possible stress, he might be at fault. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The husband's request is practical, but he should have checked with her about the timing and workload. Maybe he could have offered to help with prep or adjusted the request if she's too busy. Since she got upset, maybe the way he asked was an issue. But the core request might be valid. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the note that communication could have been better. But according to the AITA logic, if the husband's request is reasonable and the wife is being uncooperative without valid reason, then he's not wrong. But if the request is too much for her, then he might be. However, given the context, he's trying to manage a stressful situation, so likely answer is B.\n"
