It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. Here's the situation: the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband will have to handle her half of the chores, including cooking, which she usually does. He asked her to prep dinners for the week so he doesn't have to deal with picky eaters. She got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he can just make sandwiches. He thinks it's fair since she's taking the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is taking on extra responsibilities during her absence. He's asking her to prepare meals in advance to make his week easier. The wife feels it's too much work. Is his request reasonable?\n\nIn relationships, sharing responsibilities is important. Normally, the wife handles cooking, but now she's going away. He's trying to plan ahead. Meal prepping might be a way to ensure consistency, especially with kids who are used to her cooking. The wife's response was dismissive, suggesting sandwiches as an alternative. That could indicate she feels her request is being minimized or not taken seriously.\n\nBut the husband's perspective is that since she's the one going on the trip, it's fair to ask for her to help by prepping. However, she might feel that the request is adding extra work when she's already preparing for her trip. The key here is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. Meal prepping can be time-consuming, and if she's already planning a trip, adding that task might be seen as imposing. On the other hand, the husband is trying to manage the household without her.\n\nI think both sides have valid points. The husband is trying to ensure the kids eat well, and the wife might feel overwhelmed. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he asked her to prep and she felt it was too much, but he didn't consider her workload, maybe he is in the wrong. However, it's also about communication. If he explained his reasons and she still refused, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But since he didn't consider her possible stress from the trip, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. But generally, expecting someone to take on extra work when they're already preparing for a trip might be too much. So maybe the husband is not in the wrong, but the wife's reaction is also valid. Hmm. The answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to manage the situation, but others might see it differently. However, considering the wife's workload, perhaps the husband should have found another solution. Wait, but the question is if he's in the wrong. If the request was reasonable and communicated properly, then no. Since the wife is the one going on the trip, it's a bit of a stretch to say he's in the wrong. So B.\n"
