She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that she's going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. He'll be handling everything alone, including chores and cooking. Normally, she does the cooking, and the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals for the week to make it easier, but she got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested if it's too hard he can just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if his request is reasonable. He's asking her to prep meals for the week before her trip. She's the one who normally cooks, so it makes sense she knows the kids' preferences better. His reasoning is that he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food. But she thinks it's too much work and is upset about it. \n\nSo, why might he be in the wrong? Maybe he didn't consider her workload or her feelings about the request. Even though he's trying to make things easier for himself, he might not have thought about how much effort meal prepping would take her. If she's going on a trip, maybe she's already stressed about packing and getting ready, and adding meal prep could be an extra burden. He might not have asked nicely or considered alternatives. Also, suggesting that she's taking a week off and this is a fair trade-off might not take into account that she's entitled to her trip without extra labor.\n\nOn the other hand, his perspective is that he's trying to manage the household alone for the first time and wants to avoid stress. Since she's the primary cook, relying on her to prepare meals in advance could be logical. But the key here is communication. Did he present the request as a reasonable ask, or did he frame it in a way that made her feel guilty or overburdened? If she's upset, maybe the way he phrased the request or the assumption that she should do it without considering her capacity is the issue.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the assumption that she should do all the meal prep is unfair. Perhaps he could have offered to take on more at home, or maybe they could have split the prep work. Alternatively, maybe he's not considering that she might need the trip as a break and doesn't want to spend her time prepping. It's possible he's not recognizing her need for a break and is instead making her responsible for his challenges during her absence.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if she's the primary cook and he's asking for her help in advance, it's not inherently wrong. However, if she's already stressed or if the prep is too much, it might be unreasonable. The fact that she got upset suggests that the request might have crossed into being a bit much for her. Also, his fallback of \"just make sandwiches\" implies he's not fully considering alternatives, which might show a lack of flexibility.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The user's request isn't inherently wrong, but the way he approached it or the lack of consideration for his wife's workload and feelings might be. The key is whether he balanced his needs with hers. Since the wife is going on her first trip and it's a significant time apart for the kids, he might need to adjust his expectations. Maybe he's not wrong in wanting the meal prep, but perhaps he's in the wrong for not being flexible or empathetic to her situation. Alternatively, she might be in the wrong for not being supportive. But given the info, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable, but maybe there's room for compromise. Wait, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not considering her feelings and the work involved, maybe he is a little. But since he's trying to manage the household, it's a tough call. \n\nHmm, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his request is practical. However, he could have communicated better. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the wife is going on a trip, it's reasonable to ask her to prepare meals if that's her role. So, he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
