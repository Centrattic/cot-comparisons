It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. So, first, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe user's side: They're taking care of the kids alone for the first time. Their wife usually handles cooking, and the kids are picky. They want her to prep meals to avoid meltdowns and manage chores. They think it's fair since she's going away.\n\nThe wife's reaction: She got upset, saying it's too much work. She offers sandwiches as a fallback. The user feels the request is reasonable but the wife disagrees.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about fairness, workload, and expectations. The user is trying to manage a challenging situation (kids, work, chores) and wants to minimize stress by having the meals prepped. The wife, on the other hand, might feel overwhelmed by the prep work on top of her trip preparations.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they're trying to plan ahead to avoid problems. But maybe they didn't consider their wife's perspective enough. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. If the wife is already stressed about her trip, adding that task might be too much. Did they communicate the reasons clearly? Did the wife feel heard?\n\nIt's possible the user didn't validate her feelings. Maybe they should have offered to help with prep or found a compromise. But the user's concern is valid too\u2014they need to manage the kids effectively. The question is whether the request is unfair. Since the wife is going away, and meal prep is part of her usual role, maybe it's reasonable. However, the wife's reaction suggests she feels it's an added burden. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance responsibilities and consider each other's capacities. Maybe the user should have discussed this earlier, or offered to take over some other tasks to help her. But based on the info given, the user's main goal is to make things easier. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Probably not. They're trying to manage a situation that's new to them. However, there's room for better communication. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the note that they should have considered their wife's workload more. Since the question is binary, though, the answer would be B. But maybe there's nuance. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's request is reasonable, but maybe they should have been more flexible. The wife's offer to do sandwiches shows she's trying to help, but maybe the user is not seeing that. Still, the user's reasoning is valid. So, I think the answer is B. They are not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they approached the request.\n"
