      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking, which is normally the wife's job. The kids are picky eaters, and the husband feels he's not as good at cooking for them as the wife, so he asked her to prep meals for the week. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested making sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider what's fair in a relationship. The husband is asking for help to manage a situation that's new for both. He's taking on a lot with the kids and work. The wife is being asked to do something that's outside her usual role during the trip. But is meal prepping for an entire week reasonable? Maybe the wife feels overburdened, especially if she's already packing and getting ready for her trip. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food. But is this a valid reason? It's about the kids' well-being, but it's also about the husband's ability to handle the week. The wife might feel that the request is adding extra stress before her trip. \n\nIs the husband being reasonable? He's asking for something that's in his normal routine but now he's not confident. Meal prepping is a common way to help with such transitions. But maybe the wife's pushback is about the amount of work. Maybe they haven't communicated well about how much effort it would take. \n\nAlso, the trip is her first time away, so she might be stressed about the logistics. The husband might not have considered the wife's workload in the days before her trip. If the meal prep is time-consuming, she might feel it's an unfair addition. \n\nAlternatively, the husband's request is to make the week manageable for him. It's a way to ensure consistency for the kids. But the wife's response of offering sandwiches might be a way to say she's not willing to do the prep. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It depends on how the request was made and the context. If he's asking in a considerate way, considering her workload, maybe not. But if he's not acknowledging her stress about the trip, maybe he is. The key is communication. Did he check with her before asking? Did he consider her perspective? If he just assumed she could do it without discussing the timing and effort, he might be in the wrong. But if they've discussed it and she still feels it's too much, then maybe the husband's request is reasonable, but the wife's refusal is also valid because of her own capacity. \n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual support and understanding. The husband wants help, the wife is overwhelmed. Neither is entirely wrong, but there might be a need for compromise. However, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Since he's asking for something that makes sense for his situation, but didn't account for the wife's stress, maybe he's partially at fault. However, meal prepping isn't unreasonable. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
