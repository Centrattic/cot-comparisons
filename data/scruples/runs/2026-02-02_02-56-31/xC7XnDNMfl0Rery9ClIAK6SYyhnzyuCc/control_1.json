It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband asked his wife to meal prep for the week she's away. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work. The husband's reasoning is that he's not as familiar with the kids' picky eating habits and wants to avoid meltdowns. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born, so the husband is taking over her responsibilities. Cooking is her usual role, and she's more attuned to the kids' preferences. He wants her to prepare meals in advance to make things easier for him. But she's resisting, thinking it's too much.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help to manage a situation that's new and stressful for him. He's not trying to make her do extra work for no reason; he has a valid concern about the kids' mealtime issues. On the other hand, the wife is also under pressure because she's going on a trip. She might feel that the request is adding to her pre-trip workload. \n\nBut wait, the trip is her time away, and she's the one who's going to be absent. It's reasonable to ask her to prepare in advance since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences better. The husband isn't asking for something unreasonable; he's trying to balance his workload during her absence. The wife's response of just making sandwiches might not be practical if the kids are used to certain meals. \n\nHowever, the wife's feelings are valid too. Maybe she's overwhelmed with her own trip preparations. But the husband's request is about ensuring the kids eat well during her absence. It's a common practice for people to meal prep when they're going away, especially if they have specific dietary needs. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong here. He's being proactive and considering the kids' needs. The wife's reaction might be based on stress, but the request is reasonable. The key is that he's asking her to do something within her capacity (prepping meals she already knows the kids like) before the trip, not during.\n"
