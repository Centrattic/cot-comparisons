It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife going on a week-long trip, and the husband asking her to meal prep for the kids since he's not as good at cooking and the kids are picky. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches instead. The husband thinks it's fair to ask her to prep meals because she's the one going away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's taking over all her chores, including cooking, which he's less familiar with. He wants to avoid the kids' meltdowns over unfamiliar food. The wife's argument is that meal prepping for a week is too much work and she's already going on a trip. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help to manage a situation that's challenging for him. Meal prepping isn't unusual; people often do it to manage busy times. But the wife is on a trip, so she might have limited time or resources. Maybe the husband didn't consider that she might be busy or stressed before her trip. \n\nBut on the other hand, expecting her to prepare meals for the week could be seen as a reasonable request, especially if it's to ensure the kids are well-fed. The husband isn't asking for her to come back; he's asking for a temporary help before she leaves. \n\nHowever, the wife's reaction might stem from feeling that her own trip is being prioritized over her workload. Maybe she feels that the husband isn't contributing enough or that the request is last-minute. The key here is communication. Did the husband ask in a timely manner? Did he consider alternative solutions, like partial prepping or asking for help elsewhere?\n\nThe husband's reasoning seems valid because he's trying to handle a significant change in routine. But maybe he should have discussed it earlier or considered that she might not be able to do it. The wife's response might be about feeling overwhelmed. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong. It's a reasonable request to ask for a favor before a trip, especially when there's a practical reason. The wife's refusal might be more about her own stress than the request itself. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
