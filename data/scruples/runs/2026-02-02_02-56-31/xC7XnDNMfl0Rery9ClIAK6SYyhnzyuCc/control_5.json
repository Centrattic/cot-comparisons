It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nSo the situation: The wife is going away for a week, first time since the kids were born. The author will have to handle everything alone, including chores and cooking. Normally, cooking is the wife's job. The kids are picky, and she knows their preferences better. The author asked her to prep dinners for the week to make his life easier. She got upset, said it's too much work, and suggested he can just do sandwiches instead. The author thinks it's not unfair to ask since she's going away, and he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He's taking on a big responsibility alone. Cooking is his wife's area, and he's worried about the kids' picky eating. He's asking her to prep meals to reduce stress. It seems reasonable because he's managing without her support. Maybe he's not expecting her to do all the work, just some prep to make it easier.\n\nOn the wife's side: She's going on a trip, which is a time for her to be away. She might feel overwhelmed with the request, especially if she's already packing, preparing for travel, etc. Maybe she feels it's unfair to add more work before the trip. She's also upset, so maybe there's underlying stress or other factors. She suggests sandwiches as an alternative, so perhaps she's trying to offer a solution but doesn't want the prep.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help managing a situation that's new and potentially stressful. He's not forcing her, but the wife is refusing. The key points are mutual responsibilities, communication, and expectations. It's possible the author didn't consider how much the prep would add to her pre-trip workload. Maybe they need to talk more about dividing responsibilities, considering her time and his. But the author's intent is to avoid meltdowns and manage the week, which is understandable. However, expecting her to prep might be a bit much if she's already busy with her trip preparations. The answer might depend on whether the request was reasonable given her circumstances.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to prepare and is asking for help, and she's refusing, it's not necessarily his fault. However, maybe he didn't consider her workload. But the wife's reaction might be over the top. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to plan ahead. Alternatively, maybe he is because he's asking her to take on more work right before a trip. The answer might be B (No), because the author's request is reasonable given the situation, and the wife's refusal is her own choice, not his fault.\n"
