It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that she's going on a week-long trip for the first time since the kids were born, so the husband will have to handle all the chores and cooking alone. The wife normally does the cooking, and since the kids are picky, the husband thinks he can't do it as well. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset, saying that's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nHmm. The user is trying to balance his needs with his wife's. On one hand, he's reasonable in asking for help since he's taking on more responsibility. But maybe he didn't consider her workload or feelings. The wife might feel that meal prepping for a week is a lot, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. She might feel overwhelmed or not be in the right headspace to do extra work. So, maybe the husband didn't communicate his request in a supportive way, or perhaps he didn't consider that she might have other things to do before her trip. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's going away for the first time might mean she's already stressed about the trip or about leaving the kids. Asking her to prep meals could add to that stress. He might not be considering her perspective. Maybe he should have offered to help with the prepping or found another solution together instead of making it feel like an extra burden. The wife's response about sandwiches might indicate that she feels her husband is being unrealistic or not considering her capacity. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to look out for his own ability to handle the week, which is understandable. But if he didn't approach it with empathy and understanding of her situation, then maybe he's not considering her feelings. The key here is communication and mutual support. It's possible that both sides have valid points but need to talk it out more to find a solution that works for both. The husband might not be in the wrong, but he could have handled the request better. The answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in how he approached the situation.\n"
