It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is at fault for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. His reasoning is that cooking is her responsibility, the kids are picky, and he's worried about meltdowns if the meals aren't right. He's also taking over her chores for the week, so he wants to make things easier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if his request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week is a significant task, but it's something many people do. However, the wife is already going on a trip, which might be stressful for her. If she's already packing and preparing for travel, adding meal prep could be an extra burden. The husband's intention is to make things easier for himself, but he might not be considering her workload or stress levels.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband has a valid concern about managing the kids' meals. Since the wife knows their preferences better, her prepping could prevent issues. But the key here is communication. Did he approach her in a way that's understanding of her situation? If he came off as demanding rather than collaborative, that could be the issue. The wife's reaction suggests she felt the request was too much, maybe because she's already stressed about the trip.\n\nAnother angle: Is meal prep typical in their household? If cooking is her usual role, asking her to prep before leaving might not be unreasonable. But if she's already taking time off from the kids, expecting her to do extra work right before could be seen as unfair. Also, the husband's alternative of making sandwiches shows he's trying to have a backup, but he's not offering to help with the prep, which might be where she felt the demand was too much.\n\nConsidering all this, the husband's request might not be wrong in intent, but the way he asked or the timing could have been an issue. However, the wife's reaction might be about her stress rather than the request itself. Since he's not forcing her and she's refusing, maybe he should find another solution. But the question is if he's in the wrong. The answer likely is B (not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable, but the situation's nuance matters. However, if the request is seen as adding to her stress, maybe A. But the community often sides with the person trying to plan ahead unless the request is clearly unreasonable. Given that meal prep is common, and he's providing a backup plan, B makes sense.\n"
