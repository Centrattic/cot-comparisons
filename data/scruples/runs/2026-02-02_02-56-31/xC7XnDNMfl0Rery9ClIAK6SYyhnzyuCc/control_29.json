It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is taking over her chores, including cooking. He asked her to pre-make the dinners for the week since the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. She got upset and refused, saying it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking for the kids, and they have specific preferences. Meal prepping would make his week easier, especially since it's the first time he's managing everything alone. He's asking for help that makes sense given the circumstances. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work to her trip preparation, which she's already dealing with. She might also feel that it's unreasonable to expect her to do this when she's not even present to manage it, or maybe she's overwhelmed with her own trip planning.\n\nI should think about the fairness of the request. The wife is going away, so she's not there to do the cooking during her absence. But prepping meals in advance is something she can do before her trip. Is it a reasonable amount of work? The husband thinks it's necessary for the kids' well-being and his own sanity, but the wife finds it too much. Maybe the issue is communication\u2014did they discuss this beforehand? Are there other solutions? For example, maybe she can prep a few meals and he takes over the rest, or adjust the menu to something simpler. However, the husband specifically asked for a week's worth, which she might see as too time-consuming.\n\nAlso, considering that this is her first trip away since the kids were born, maybe she's already stressed about being away, and the meal prep adds to that stress. The husband might not realize how much effort it would take her. Alternatively, he might feel that since she's the one who usually cooks, it's fair to ask for help in this situation.\n\nAnother angle: Does the husband have a history of contributing to meal prep? If cooking is her responsibility, maybe he should be stepping up more. But in this case, he's asking her to prepare in advance to make his week easier. It's a bit of a catch-22. Maybe the problem is not about right or wrong but about communication and expectations. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of general fairness, asking a partner to help out with something that makes your transition easier when they're going away isn't inherently wrong. However, if the request is unreasonable in terms of time or effort, that could be an issue. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week might be a lot, but if the kids are picky and she knows their preferences, maybe it's necessary. The wife's refusal might stem from feeling it's too much, but the husband sees it as necessary. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's seeking help to manage the transition, and his reasoning is valid. The wife's reaction is valid too, but the request itself isn't unfair. The problem might be in how it was communicated or the amount of work involved, but the author's intention is reasonable.\n"
