It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about managing the kids and chores, especially cooking. The wife got upset when asked to prep meals and suggested making sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking since his wife handles it, and the kids are picky. He thinks meal prepping would help him avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. He also mentions that this is his first time alone with the kids, so he's probably feeling overwhelmed.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is taking a much-needed break, and preparing meals for the week could be a significant task. She might be feeling that the request is adding to her stress before her trip. It's possible she has other things to do, or she's worried about the time it would take. Her suggestion of sandwiches shows she's trying to offer an alternative, but maybe she doesn't feel it's fair to ask her to prep all the meals.\n\nNow, thinking about fairness. The husband isn't asking for something unreasonable in itself, but the key is whether it's fair given the circumstances. The wife is going on a trip, which is a relief for her. If the request is too much for her to handle, especially if she's already stressed about leaving, then maybe the husband is overstepping. However, the husband's intent is to make his own life manageable during her absence, which is understandable.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the husband consider her workload? Maybe he didn't realize how much the meal prepping would add to her plate. Alternatively, the wife might not be aware of how challenging it will be for him. It's possible that there's a lack of discussion about what each can realistically handle.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's request isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be in not discussing the alternatives or underestimating her capacity. The wife's reaction could stem from feeling that the request is too burdensome, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Also, maybe she feels it's his responsibility now that she's away, which he might not be equipped to handle, leading to tension.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer isn't black and white. The husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to make things easier, but he might need to consider his wife's perspective better. However, based on the information given, the husband's request seems reasonable as he's trying to manage his responsibilities while she's away. The wife's refusal might be due to different priorities or stress, but that doesn't necessarily make the husband wrong.\n"
