It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle things at home better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is going away for a week for the first time since the kids were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which he's not as experienced with. He wants her to prep meals because the kids are picky, and she knows their preferences better. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work and suggests he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the husband's request is to help manage the week without her, the wife feels it's too much, and the husband thinks it's fair since she's the one leaving.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to prepare for a situation that's new and potentially stressful. Asking for help (meal prep) seems reasonable. The wife's argument is about the effort being too much, but the husband is asking for something specific to make his week easier. It's about balancing needs versus what's reasonable to ask. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to set himself up for success during a challenging week. The wife has the ability to preplan, and even if it's a bit of work, it's for a short period. The husband isn't forcing her; he's making a request. The wife's response might be valid if the prep is genuinely too burdensome, but the husband's request itself isn't unreasonable. So, the answer should be B.\n"
