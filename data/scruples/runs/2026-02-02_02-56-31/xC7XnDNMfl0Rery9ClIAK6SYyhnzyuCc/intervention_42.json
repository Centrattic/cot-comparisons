It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and he wants her to prep meals because he's not as good with the kids' picky eating. She got upset, thinking it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is trying to manage his workload and ensure the kids eat well. It makes sense he'd want to avoid meltdowns by having familiar meals. But the wife might feel it's an extra burden on top of her trip prep. Maybe she's stressed about the trip and the added task is overwhelming.\n\nIs the husband being fair? He's asking her to do something that's part of her usual duties. Since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences, it's logical she'd be the one to prep. But he should consider her workload. Maybe a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all, but he went for the full week. Did he offer to help or take some responsibility? He says he can do it but it's harder for him. That's valid, but maybe he should be more proactive in assisting rather than just asking her to prep all.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She felt it was too much, so the husband might need to communicate better and see if there's a compromise. Maybe she's already preparing for her trip and feels this is an added stress. The key is mutual support. If he's expecting her to handle all the meal prep, maybe he's not taking enough on his end. But he's new to handling full chores and cooking, so perhaps it's a reasonable request. \n\nIn the end, the question is whether the request is unfair. If it's within her capacity and part of her usual role, then it's not entirely his fault. But he should consider her feelings and maybe find a balance. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable given his situation, but he should check in with her to ensure it's manageable. However, if the wife is already overburdened, he might need to adjust. But based on the information, the answer is B.\n"
