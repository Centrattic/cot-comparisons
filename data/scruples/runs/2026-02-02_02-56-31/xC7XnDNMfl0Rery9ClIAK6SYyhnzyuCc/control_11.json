It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. So the wife is going on a week-long trip, first time away from the kids. The husband is worried about handling the chores and cooking since the wife usually does that. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it gets hard.\n\nHmm. The husband's reasoning is that the kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. So he wants the prepped meals to avoid meltdowns. But the wife is upset because it's a lot of extra work. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, maybe the husband's request is reasonable. He's taking over her responsibilities, so asking her to help in advance could make things easier. But on the other hand, she's going on a trip, so maybe she's already busy with her own preparations. Maybe she feels that her trip time should be for her, not to do extra work. Also, the idea that cooking is her responsibility might be a traditional role, but maybe they should share the chores more equally in general.\n\nWait, but the wife is the one who usually cooks. The husband acknowledges that he can do it but it's harder for him. So maybe it's fair to ask her to help out before she leaves. But she's not willing to do that. Is it unfair to expect her to prepare meals when she's going on a trip? Maybe she feels that she's already giving up her time by going on the trip, and the husband should handle it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have offered to help with the prep instead of just asking her to do it. Or maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all. The wife's response seems a bit dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, but the husband is concerned about the kids' reactions. \n\nI think the key here is whether the request is reasonable. The husband is in a tough spot, handling more responsibilities. If the wife is going on a trip, maybe she's expected to help prepare. But if it's too much for her, then maybe the husband has to adjust. However, the wife's reaction might be a bit harsh. So, is the husband in the wrong? Probably not. He's trying to manage his responsibilities. The wife might be right in feeling it's too much, but the husband's intention is to make things easier. So answer B, No.\n"
