It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the user is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is typically the wife's job, and the kids are picky. The user asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. He thinks it's fair because she's going away, and he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about fairness and workload. The user wants to make things easier by prepping meals, but the wife is already stressed about the trip. Maybe she's overwhelmed with the idea of meal prepping on top of her trip preparations. The user's reasoning is that since she's the primary cook and knows the kids' preferences, having her prep meals would help him manage. But the wife's reaction suggests she feels it's an unfair additional burden.\n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. The user is trying to prepare for the week, which is reasonable. But the wife might feel that the request is adding to her existing workload right before her trip. Maybe she's already dealing with the stress of the trip itself, and the meal prepping is an extra task she didn't expect. It's possible that the user didn't consider her perspective in that moment. \n\nAlso, the wife offered an alternative (sandwiches) which is a compromise, but the user seems to reject that. Maybe they need to communicate better. The user might not be in the wrong entirely because they have a valid concern about the kids' mealtime, but they could have approached it differently. Perhaps checking in with the wife's capacity to take on more tasks before the trip, or offering to help with some prep instead of expecting her to do it all. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's refusal might be justified if she's already stretched thin. The user's request adds to her responsibilities just before she leaves, which could be seen as unfair. The user might need to balance their own needs with their partner's capacity. \n\nSo, considering both sides, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the user's intention is to make the week manageable, which is reasonable. They might not be in the wrong for making the request, but they could have been more considerate of their wife's workload. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication could be improved.\n"
