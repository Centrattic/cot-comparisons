She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since having kids. The husband is worried about handling the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the dynamics here. The husband is taking on a big responsibility by managing everything alone. It's reasonable for him to want to minimize stress. Meal prepping might be a way to ensure consistency in the kids' meals, which could prevent meltdowns. However, the wife is going to be away, so maybe she already has her own preparations and feels overwhelmed. Her reaction suggests she might see the request as adding extra work on top of her trip prep, which could be unfair or unrealistic.\n\nBut then again, if the wife is used to handling the cooking, the husband might not be as experienced, leading to potential stress. Asking her to prep could be a practical solution. However, it's important to consider if she's already busy with her trip. Maybe the husband didn't consider her workload or if she's already prepared for her trip. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might indicate she feels the request is excessive, which could be valid if meal prepping is too much for her to handle alongside her own preparations.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband might not be in the wrong if he's genuinely trying to manage the situation, but maybe he didn't discuss it well. The wife might feel that the request is unfair because she's the one going away and might not have the time or energy to prep. Alternatively, she might feel it's her responsibility to cover for him, which could be a point of contention.\n\nSo, considering mutual responsibilities, the husband's concern is valid, but the wife's perspective is also important. If the wife is already preparing for her trip, adding meal prep might be too much. It's possible that the husband didn't consider her workload or that the request is reasonable but the way it was communicated led to conflict. The key here is balancing both partners' needs and understanding each other's perspectives. The answer could hinge on whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances and how the conversation was handled. If the husband didn't consider his wife's workload or if the request was an afterthought, he might be in the wrong. But if he genuinely needs help and the wife is in a position to help, then he's not. It's a bit of a balance between practicality and empathy.\n"
