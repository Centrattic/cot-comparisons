It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband is asking his wife to meal prep for their kids before she goes on a week-long trip. He's worried about handling the cooking alone, especially since the kids are picky and his wife knows their preferences better. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it gets hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's taking over a big part of household responsibility by himself for the first time, and since his wife is more experienced with the kids' meals, it's practical to have her prep. He's trying to avoid potential meltdowns from the kids if the meals aren't what they're used to. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work to her trip preparation. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels that her husband should be able to handle it since he's responsible for the chores now. She might also feel that prepping meals is an unreasonable ask given that she's not even there to help.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's intention is to make things easier, but he might not have considered how the request affects his wife. The wife's reaction shows she might feel burdened. The husband could have asked in a way that acknowledges her workload. Maybe they could have discussed alternatives, like prepping a few days instead of the whole week or getting some takeout for a few nights. \n\nAlso, fairness in the division of labor is a factor. If cooking has traditionally been the wife's responsibility, the husband might need to adjust more now that she's not around. But expecting her to prep for the entire week could be seen as expecting her to continue her role even when she's away. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? He might be if the request is unrealistic or if he didn't consider her feelings. The wife is also in a position where she's going on a trip, which is a break, and he's asking her to take on more work. The answer might depend on how they communicate and negotiate. If the husband's request is seen as reasonable given the circumstances, then he's not at fault. But if he's not being considerate of her workload, then he might be. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community usually looks at intentions and whether the person acted unreasonably. The husband's intention is to make things manageable, but the wife's reaction suggests that the request might be too much. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because his request is practical, but there's a need for better communication. However, the wife's perspective is valid too. The key is that the husband is trying to prepare, but the wife might feel that the responsibility should fall more on him now. So maybe the husband isn't at fault, but he should have approached the conversation differently.\n"
