It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. His wife is going away for a week, their first time apart since the kids were born. He's worried about handling everything alone, especially cooking since the kids are picky. He asked her to pre-make dinners, but she got upset and said it's too much work, offering sandwiches instead.\n\nSo, the user is saying he's not being unfair because she's going on a week trip. The key points here are about fairness, workload, and understanding each other's perspectives. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the user's request: he wants his wife to meal prep to ease his burden. His reasoning is that she knows the kids' preferences better and he's not confident in his ability to cook for them. That makes sense. But his wife is upset, thinking it's too much work. Maybe she feels it's an extra chore on top of her trip prep. She's taking a week off, and he's asking her to do prep work, which might add stress.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's trying to prepare for his responsibility while she's away. But maybe he didn't consider how much that request adds to her existing tasks. They might not have discussed it in a way that's considerate of her workload. However, his intention is good\u2014he wants to avoid problems with the kids' meals. But maybe he didn't frame the request as a collaborative effort. Perhaps he should have offered to help with some prep or acknowledged her effort instead of just assigning the task.\n\nOn the other hand, she's taking a week off, which is a time she might need to focus on her own preparations. If he's expecting her to do meal prep in addition to packing, planning her trip, etc., that could be a lot. The fact that she suggested sandwiches shows she's trying to compromise, but he might see that as not meeting his needs. There's a mismatch in expectations here.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on how the request was made and the context of their usual responsibilities. If cooking is her usual task and he's just asking her to continue that role temporarily, maybe it's not unreasonable. But if she's already stressed about the trip and the prep adds too much, maybe he should have found another solution. Alternatively, maybe they need to better communicate and divide responsibilities. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how the request was handled. The answer might be B (No), but with the caveat that communication could have been better.\n"
