On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before a trip. His wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time she's been away since the kids were born. He's worried about handling all the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and his wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He's confused because he thinks it's reasonable since she's the one going away.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The user's reasoning is that he's taking over her responsibilities, and meal prepping would help him avoid stress with the kids. His wife, on the other hand, might feel overwhelmed by the request, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's busy packing, dealing with travel logistics, and feels that being asked to do extra work isn't fair. \n\nI should think about communication. Did he approach her in a way that considered her feelings? If he just asked without understanding her perspective, maybe she felt it added to her stress. Also, maybe she feels that he's not confident in his ability to handle cooking, which could be a point of tension. \n\nAnother angle: sharing responsibilities. Cooking is usually her role, but he's willing to step up, which is good. However, asking her to prep meals might be seen as not trusting him, or maybe she doesn't have the physical or mental capacity to do both her trip prep and the meal prepping. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe prepping just a few meals instead of the whole week, or compromising on the number of prepped meals? But the user is asking if he's in the wrong, not about solutions. \n\nConsidering fairness, since she's the one leaving, maybe he expects her to help ease his burden. But she might feel it's unfair to add to her workload right before a trip. It's possible that the request is reasonable, but the way it was communicated or the timing is the issue. \n\nAlso, maybe she's not used to being asked to do something that's not part of her usual routine. If prepping meals isn't something she normally does, asking her to do it now could be a stretch. \n\nI think the key points are mutual understanding, communication style, and the balance of responsibilities. The user's intention is to reduce stress, which is valid. His wife's reaction suggests that the request might be adding to her stress. So, maybe the problem is not in the request itself but how it was framed or the current context. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. But generally, asking for help before a trip isn't inherently wrong. However, if the wife feels pressured or that her own needs aren't being considered, that could be a point against the user. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No, he's not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable given the circumstances. However, it's important for him to have a conversation to better understand her perspective and find a compromise. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would be B.\n"
