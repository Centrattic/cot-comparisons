It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, it's the first time the kids have been away from her, and the husband is worried about managing the cooking since the wife usually handles it and knows the kids' preferences better. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He's wondering if he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is in a tough spot. He's going to have to manage all the chores alone, including cooking for picky kids. Meal prepping by the wife could make his job easier, especially since she's more familiar with their preferences. On the other hand, the wife might be feeling overwhelmed or stressed about her trip, or maybe the meal prep is too much on top of her other responsibilities. She's taking a well-deserved break, so being asked to do prep work could add stress.\n\nIs the husband wrong for asking? Well, he's being practical. He's not trying to shift all the burden here; he's asking for help that makes sense given the circumstances. The wife's response of offering sandwiches seems dismissive. Maybe she finds the request unreasonable because she's already planning to be away and might not have the time or energy to prep, especially if she's busy with her trip's own preparations.\n\nBut the key point is that the husband's request is about managing the kids' meals during his time alone. Since the wife is the one who usually does it and knows the kids better, it's a logical request. However, the wife might feel that being away is a chance to decompress, and meal prepping could interfere with her trip's relaxation. She might also perceive the request as not trusting her ability to handle the trip's prep or as micromanaging.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? I don't think so. He's trying to manage his responsibilities and reduce stress for himself and the kids. He's acknowledging his wife's role and experience. The wife's reaction might be about other issues, like feeling taken for granted or overwhelmed. The husband's request is reasonable given the circumstances, especially since he's taking on all her chores. Asking her to do one specific task that eases his burden isn't unfair. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
