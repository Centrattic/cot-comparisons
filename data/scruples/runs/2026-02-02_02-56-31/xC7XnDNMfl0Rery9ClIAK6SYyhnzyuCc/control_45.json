She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the context: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is handling all the chores and cooking, which he's not as experienced with because the wife usually does it. The kids are picky eaters, and he's worried about not meeting their preferences, leading to meltdowns. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The husband is taking on a significant additional responsibility with the kids and work. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable, just to prepare meals in advance so he has a easier time. His reasoning is practical: he knows her cooking better suits the kids' needs. The wife, on the other hand, is going on a trip, which is a time she might need to relax or have some freedom. She might feel that meal prepping is an extra burden, especially if she's already stressed about being away. Her response suggests she feels the request is too much, even if it's for a good reason.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to manage the household during her absence, which is a common and reasonable concern. Asking for support in the form of prepping meals isn't inherently wrong. However, there's the aspect of communication. He might not have considered how much time or effort the meal prep would require for her. Maybe he didn't offer to help with the prep or didn't validate her feelings. The wife's reaction indicates she might be overwhelmed, perhaps not just by the meal prep but other factors like stress about the trip or existing household responsibilities.\n\nBut the key point is whether the request itself is unfair. The husband is not forcing her; he's making a request. Since she's going away, the timing is a bit tricky. If she's already packing, planning the trip, maybe she's not in the best position to take on extra work. The husband's request might be well-intentioned but poorly timed or communicated. However, his reasoning is practical. He's looking for support to manage the kids, which is a common need in parenting.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a grey area. He's not wrong for trying to make his situation manageable, but he might need to be more considerate of her workload. The wife's refusal could stem from her own stress or the perception that the request is too much. The husband might benefit from a compromise, like partially prepping meals or adjusting the amount. But as per whether he's in the wrong, the answer isn't clear-cut. However, the question specifically asks if he's in the wrong, not if there's room for improvement. Since his request is based on a legitimate need and isn't unreasonable, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that he didn't consider her capacity or that he's shifting some of his responsibility onto her during her trip. Still, the core issue is about managing household duties, and his request is a reasonable way to do that. So, the answer would be B.\n"
