It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. They mention that she's going away for a week, their first time without her since the kids were born. He has to take over her chores and work, and since cooking is usually her responsibility, he wants her to prep meals for the week. She got upset, said it's too much work, and suggested he can make sandwiches instead. He argues it's not unfair because she's the one going away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's preparing for a challenging week alone with the kids, and since he's not as familiar with their food preferences, prepping meals would help avoid meltdowns. The wife feels it's too much to ask, maybe because of the time and effort involved, or perhaps she's already stressed about the trip. \n\nIn relationships, fairness is subjective. The husband is trying to manage his responsibilities, which is reasonable. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra strain on her before her trip. It's important to consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe she can prep some meals but not all, or they can adjust expectations. \n\nThe key here is communication. The husband might not be in the wrong for wanting to prepare, but the way the request was made or the lack of compromise could be an issue. If the wife feels it's too much, maybe they need to talk about alternative solutions. The husband's intention is good\u2014he's preparing to handle the week, but he should respect her feelings about the request. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not (B), because his intention is to manage the situation better. However, he might need to approach the conversation differently next time, considering her workload and finding a compromise. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed, so understanding her perspective is crucial. The husband isn't wrong for asking, but they both need to work on communication and mutual understanding.\n"
