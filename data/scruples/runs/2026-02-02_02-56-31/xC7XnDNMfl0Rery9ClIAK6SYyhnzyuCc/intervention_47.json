It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling everything, especially cooking, since their kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much. He doesn't think it's unfair because she's the one leaving, but he's feeling like he's in a tough spot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request is about practicality and reducing stress. He's taking on more chores and wants to avoid kitchen meltdowns. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the request is adding extra work right before her trip, which could be stressful for her. She might also feel that he's not confident in his ability to handle cooking, which could be a point of contention.\n\nCommunication is key here. The husband's approach might come off as a demand rather than a collaborative discussion. Maybe he didn't consider her perspective\u2014how much time she has before her trip, how she feels about the request, or if there's another way to handle the situation. The wife's reaction suggests that she feels the request is unreasonable, possibly because she's already stressed about her trip or has other commitments.\n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals? It depends on their usual dynamics. If meal prep is part of her regular responsibilities, then maybe it's fair. But since she's leaving, maybe she's already packing and preparing for her trip, so adding meal prep could be overwhelming. The husband could have offered to help with the prep or suggested a compromise, like prepping a few meals instead of all of them. \n\nThe wife's suggestion to make sandwiches is a possible solution, but the husband is worried about the kids' reactions. Maybe he needs to find a middle ground where he can handle the meals without relying entirely on her prep. This could involve planning meals that are easier for him to manage or involving the kids in their meal choices to reduce pickiness.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's intention is to make things easier, but the way he approached it might have been too abrupt. The wife's upset reaction is valid if she feels the request is excessive or if it's not discussed properly. The key issue here is whether the request was made in a considerate way that respects her time and stress before her trip. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the husband not being in the wrong (B), because his intention is to manage the household during her absence. However, his approach could be improved by better communication and considering her perspective. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer is B (No), but with the caveat that his method could use some adjustment.\n"
