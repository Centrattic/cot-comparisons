It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that their wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals for the week to make it easier. She got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he can just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nHmm. The user thinks it's fair to ask her to prep because she's going away and knows the kids' preferences better. But she's upset. So, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, considering the roles: cooking is her usual role, so maybe it's reasonable to ask her to prep before leaving. But she's going on a trip, and maybe she's already busy. The argument is that he's taking over her half of the chores, so maybe meal prepping would help him avoid stress. On the other hand, she might be overwhelmed, and he might be adding pressure. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep? If it's her responsibility, maybe it's reasonable. But he should consider her workload. If she finds it too much, maybe he should adjust. But the user is concerned about the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't right. \n\nMaybe there's a middle ground. However, the main point is whether he's in the wrong. If he's asking for something that's her usual responsibility and she's the one leaving, maybe not. But if she's already stressed about the trip, maybe it's unfair. \n\nI think it's a judgment call. But generally, asking for help preparing meals before leaving might not be unreasonable, especially since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's more nuance. The key points are that the wife is leaving, and he's taking over her duties. If she's able to prep, it's a time when she can help him. However, if she's already overwhelmed, maybe he should have adjusted. But the user's request seems reasonable given the circumstances. So B is the answer.\n"
