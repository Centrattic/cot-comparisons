It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the user is worried about handling the kids and cooking alone. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's perspective is that since the wife is going away and he's taking over her chores, it's reasonable to ask her to prep meals to make it easier. He's concerned about the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't right. On the other hand, the wife might feel that meal prepping for a week is an added burden on top of her trip preparations. Maybe she's stressed about the trip or feels that the request is unfair.\n\nI should think about common practices in relationships. Often, when one partner is going away, the other might ask for some help to ease the transition. Meal prepping can be a helpful way to manage the workload. However, the wife's reaction suggests she might be overwhelmed. Maybe the user didn't consider that she might not want to add more tasks before her trip. Alternatively, she might be used to cooking and not want to take on extra work, feeling it's not her responsibility anymore.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The user asked, but the wife felt it was too much. Maybe they need to discuss expectations and how to share responsibilities without overburdening each other. The user's intention is to manage stress, but the wife's response indicates that the request might have been a bit much, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Perhaps the user could have found a middle ground, like prepping for a few days instead of the entire week.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that the wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born. That's a significant change, and maybe the user is feeling anxious about handling everything alone. It's natural to seek support, but the wife's reaction might stem from her own stress about the trip or not wanting to take on additional work before leaving.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the user isn't asking for something unreasonable. Meal prep is a common way to help someone manage when they're overwhelmed. However, the wife's feelings are valid too. Maybe the user could have considered alternative solutions, like involving the kids more, or preparing simple meals that are easier to handle. But given the situation, the request seems reasonable. The wife's refusal might be based on her own stress or a different perception of the workload.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user's request is understandable and not inherently wrong. The wife's reaction is valid too, but that doesn't mean the user is in the wrong. They both have valid points but need to communicate better to find a solution that works for both. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
