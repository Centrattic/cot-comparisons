It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before she goes on a trip. The wife is going away for a week, the first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband has to take over her chores and cooking. He asks her to prep dinners because the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches.\n\nHmm. First, the husband's reasoning is that he's trying to manage the situation where he's taking over all the responsibilities. He's asking her to help by prepping meals, which is reasonable because she's more in tune with the kids' preferences. But she's upset because it's extra work for her. The trip is her first time away, so maybe she's already stressed about that. She might feel that he's not sharing the load equally or that he's not confident in his ability to handle the cooking.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is trying to prevent meltdowns from the kids if they don't get their usual food. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding to her stress before a trip. It's possible that the husband should have offered to help with the prep, or maybe they need to discuss how responsibilities are divided. Maybe he should have taken some initiative instead of expecting her to do it. But the premise is that she's going to be away, and he's taking over her role. So asking her to prep might be fair since it's a one-time effort for a week. Alternatively, maybe the husband should have done the prep himself if he's capable, even if it's harder.\n\nThe key points are whether the request was reasonable and if there was communication. The wife's reaction could indicate that she feels the request is unfair or unrealistic. It's possible the husband didn't consider her workload or stress about the trip. Maybe he should have been more understanding. However, the husband's intention is to manage the kids' needs, which is valid. So, is he in the wrong? If the request was made without considering her stress or if he's expecting her to do it without helping, maybe. But if he's just asking for practical help, then maybe not. I think the answer is B (No), but with the nuance that communication and mutual support are important. The husband isn't in the wrong, but maybe there's room for better discussion.\n"
