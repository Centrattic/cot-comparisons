It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband will be handling all the chores and cooking. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. So he asked her to prep meals for the week. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband is taking over all the responsibilities during her absence. The kids are picky, and the wife has been the primary cook. So he's asking her to prep meals to avoid meltdowns. She's taking a trip, which is her first time away since the kids were born. The husband is handling her half of the chores, which is a lot on top of his job.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's asking for help that makes sense. The wife knows the kids' preferences better, so prepping meals would help him manage. But she might feel that meal prepping is an extra burden, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip and doesn't want the added work. \n\nI should consider if the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, especially if the kids are picky. The husband is aware he can make sandwiches, but he's trying to avoid meltdowns. It's a balance between his need for support and her capacity to provide it. \n\nIs the husband wrong for expecting her to help? Maybe not. He's not forcing her; he's making a request. However, maybe he didn't consider her workload or feelings. She might feel that the request is unfair because she's already taking time away, and adding meal prep is too much. \n\nAlternatively, the husband is trying to manage a challenging situation and seeks practical help. The wife's reaction might be due to stress, not the request itself. \n\nI need to assess if the husband is in the wrong. The key points are: the request is reasonable, but the wife might perceive it as an added burden. The husband's intention is to make things easier, but the wife's response indicates she's overwhelmed. \n\nIn such cases, communication is key. The husband could have discussed the request earlier to see her capacity. However, given the circumstances, the request seems fair. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's asking for help that makes sense, but there's room for better communication.\n"
