It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the author is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and he wants her to prepare meals ahead so it's easier for him. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he could just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born, so the husband isn't used to handling everything alone. He's asking for help because he's already taking over her chores and working. He's concerned that the kids might not eat well if he has to cook, since they're picky and she knows their preferences better. \n\nThe wife's reaction suggests she feels it's an extra burden. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels he's not considering her workload. But the husband's request is reasonable as a way to ease his burden during her absence. He's not asking her to do something during the trip, just before she leaves. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals? Well, since she's the primary cook and the kids rely on her meals, asking her to set something up before she goes could be seen as practical. The husband isn't making her stay longer; he's just asking for some preparation. The wife's response of \"just make them sandwiches\" might be dismissive, but maybe she's underestimating how difficult that would be with picky eaters. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong here. He's being proactive to manage his stress and ensure the kids eat properly. The wife might be overreacting if she's not considering the husband's situation. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
