It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. The wife normally does the cooking, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He wants her to prep the dinners for the week, but she got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he could just make sandwiches.\n\nHmm, the user is trying to plan ahead to make sure the kids have familiar meals, which is understandable. He's taking on extra responsibilities during her absence. But the wife feels it's too much to ask. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that since she's going away, it's fair to ask her to prepare meals. But maybe the wife feels that it's an unfair request because she's already preparing for her trip, and meal prepping adds extra work. Or maybe she didn't realize the extent of the challenge the husband would face alone. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask? Well, prepping a week of meals could be a lot, but maybe she has the time before the trip. However, she's the one going on the trip, so perhaps the user should have considered her workload. Alternatively, maybe the husband could have offered to help with some of the prepping, but he didn't mention that. \n\nThe wife's response was to say it's too much and suggest sandwiches, which might not be what the kids prefer. The user is concerned about the kids' reactions if the food isn't what they're used to. It's a balance between respecting each other's workloads and practical needs.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the user is taking over her half of the chores, maybe meal prepping is an extra burden. But since she's going away, maybe it's a way to support him. The question is whether the request was reasonable. The user might not be in the wrong for asking, but the wife's feelings should be considered. Maybe the user should have discussed it earlier or found a middle ground. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No) because the user's intent is to make things easier, but there might be a communication issue. Alternatively, maybe there's a middle ground they didn't find. Since the user is trying to prepare and the wife is the one going away, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But the wife's refusal might indicate that the request was too much. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances of their relationship and how they usually divide responsibilities.\n"
