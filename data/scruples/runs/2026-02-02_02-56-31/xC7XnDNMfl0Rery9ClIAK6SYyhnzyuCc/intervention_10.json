It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. So their wife is going away for a week, and they have kids who are picky eaters. The wife usually handles cooking, and the user is worried about managing without her. They asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead. The user feels it's fair to ask since she's the one leaving.\n\nHmm. The user's reasoning is that they need the meal prep because they're not as experienced with the kids' preferences and want to avoid meltdowns. They also mention taking over chores and work, so they're trying to make it easier. The wife's response was negative, saying it's too much. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The user is trying to plan ahead, which is reasonable. But the wife might feel that meal prepping for a week is a big task, especially before her trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip or the prep work adds to her stress. Are there other options? The user could have asked for fewer meals, or maybe they could have both discussed a compromise. \n\nThe user's argument is that since the wife is going away, she should prepare in advance. But the wife might feel it's unfair because she's already busy or not up for the extra work. It's a common issue in relationships where expectations aren't aligned. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, wanting to make things easier is understandable, but how they communicated it might be an issue. If they had discussed it earlier or found a middle ground, maybe the wife wouldn't be upset. But the user's request isn't unreasonable per se. It's about balancing responsibilities. Since the wife is the one leaving, perhaps the user is right to expect some help in preparation. However, the wife's refusal could be due to valid reasons too. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the user is trying to manage the situation practically. However, the communication might need improvement. The key is whether the request is fair. Since the wife is going away, it's logical to ask her to prep part of the meals. But maybe the user should have been more flexible or found another solution. But given the information, the user isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
