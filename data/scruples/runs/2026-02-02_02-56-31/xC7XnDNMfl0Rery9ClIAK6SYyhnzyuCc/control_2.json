On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is asking her to prepare dinners so he can handle the kids and chores on his own. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that the kids are picky, and his wife knows their preferences better. He's worried about meltdowns if he can't cook the same meals. He's taking over her chores for a week, so he wants to make it easier. The wife is upset because she's already going away and feels it's too much to ask to prepare food for a week. She's probably dealing with her own stress from the trip being her first time away from the kids. \n\nIs it unfair to ask her to prep? Well, she's the one who usually cooks, so maybe the husband is trying to plan ahead to avoid a problem. But on the flip side, the wife is already going to be away, and asking her to prep might add extra work that she's not comfortable doing, especially if it's a full week's worth. Maybe the husband didn't consider that she might be stressed about the trip already and doesn't have the energy to prep. \n\nAlso, when she says she can't do it and suggests sandwiches, the husband might be in a position where he needs to accept that he can't control everything, even if he's worried. The key here is communication. Did the husband consider her feelings when he made the request? Maybe he should have discussed it more and found a middle ground. \n\nBut from the husband's perspective, he's trying to manage the household alone for the first time, and he's asking for help to avoid problems. It's a reasonable request, given their circumstances. However, the wife's reaction suggests that she feels it's too much. The question is whether it's unfair to ask her to prep. If she's already going away, maybe it's too much to expect her to prep. Or maybe it's a fair request because she's the one who knows the kids' preferences. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband is being considerate of her workload. If the wife feels it's too much, maybe the husband should accept the sandwiches and find other ways to manage. But he's also trying to prevent meltdowns. It's a balance. Since the wife is the one usually cooking, she might have the skills, but she's not there to do it during the week. So, the husband is trying to replicate her work. \n\nIn the end, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to prepare, but he didn't consider her feelings. The wife's refusal is valid because she's stressed, and maybe the husband should adjust. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because his request is reasonable given the situation, even if the wife is upset. But wait, maybe the husband is being a bit selfish by not respecting her limits. Hmm. It's tricky. I think the key is that he's asking for help to manage the situation, which is fair. So B, No.\n"
