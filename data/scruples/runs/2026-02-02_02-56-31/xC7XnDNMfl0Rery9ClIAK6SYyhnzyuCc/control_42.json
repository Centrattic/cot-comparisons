      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids' meals since they're picky. He's asking her to prepare meals for the week to make it easier for him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is taking her first trip away since the kids were born, so this is a big deal. The husband is managing all the chores and kids alone, which is a lot. He's not used to cooking, and the kids are picky. His request is to have her prep meals for the week to avoid meltdowns from unfamiliar food.\n\nNow, the wife got upset because she thinks it's too much work. She's going away, so maybe she's already stressed about the trip. She offered a compromise of sandwiches, which might not be ideal but is a solution. The husband thinks it's fair to ask since she's absent, but she's the primary cook and knows the kids' preferences better.\n\nIs the husband wrong? Well, he's asking for help from his partner in a time when he's overwhelmed. The wife is not in a position to do the prep because she's traveling. Maybe he didn't consider her perspective\u2014maybe she's already preparing for her trip and the meal prep is adding too much. Or perhaps he didn't communicate the urgency properly. Alternatively, he might be making a reasonable request considering the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that since she's away, she shouldn't have to do any prep. Maybe she's already doing a lot before the trip. The husband's request could be seen as expecting her to take on extra work even when she's not there. The compromise of sandwiches is a middle ground, which he might not be satisfied with, but maybe that's the best she can do given the time.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's trying to manage a challenging week, but maybe he didn't consider that she's already focused on her trip. However, his request is practical given the kids' needs. The wife's reaction might be about feeling overburdened, but she's also the one who's going to be away. Maybe the husband could have asked earlier or offered to help with prep himself. But he's not asking her to do it during the trip; just before. \n\nOverall, I think the husband's request is reasonable. He's trying to make things manageable for himself during a stressful time. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress about the trip. Since the husband is taking on more responsibilities, it's fair to ask for some support. So, not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
