It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Since cooking is her responsibility and the kids are picky, he wants her to prep meals. She's upset because she thinks it's too much work and suggests he just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is taking a week off, so it's fair that she's expected to help prepare for her absence. Meal prepping could be a reasonable request to ease his workload. However, she's the one who's supposed to handle cooking normally, and he's acknowledging that she knows the kids' preferences better. So, from his perspective, it's logical to ask her to prepare meals that the kids are used to, avoiding potential meltdowns.\n\nOn the other hand, she's upset because she might be tired or think the request is excessive. Maybe she didn't expect this ask when planning her trip. It's possible she's feeling overwhelmed by the idea of prepping meals for a whole week, especially if she's busy with her own travel preparations. But then again, the husband is handling a significant increase in responsibilities, so it's understandable that he wants some support.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's making a practical request based on the kids' needs and his own capacity. He's not forcing her; he's asking. She's the one who's refusing and suggesting an alternative. Since it's her first time away, maybe he should have discussed this earlier, but the request itself seems reasonable. The key point is whether the request is unfair. The husband argues it's not, given the circumstances. The wife's reaction might be valid if the prepping is too much, but the husband's concern about the kids' well-being is also valid. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong. He's trying to manage the household during her absence, and asking for meal prep is a proactive step. The wife's refusal is her own choice, but the husband's request is understandable. So the answer would be B.\n"
