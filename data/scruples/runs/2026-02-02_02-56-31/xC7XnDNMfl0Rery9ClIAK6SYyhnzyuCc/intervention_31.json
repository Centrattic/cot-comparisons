It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going on her first trip away from the kids, and the husband is concerned about managing the household alone, especially since cooking is her responsibility and the kids are picky.\n\nFirst, the husband's request seems reasonable. He's asking her to pre-prepare meals for the week because he knows he'll have to handle more chores and work, and the kids might not like his cooking. The wife, however, is upset and thinks it's too much work. She offers making sandwiches as an alternative. The user is questioning if he's being unfair by asking her to prep meals.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Marriage often involves compromise and mutual support. The husband is trying to make the transition easier for himself, which is understandable. However, the wife's reaction suggests that the request might be placing an unfair burden on her, especially since she's preparing to go on a trip. If she's already busy with trip preparations, adding meal prep could be overwhelming. It's possible he didn't consider her workload or stress levels before making the request.\n\nAlso, the wife's alternative of sandwiches shows she's not unwilling to help, but perhaps the meal prep is too much. The husband's insistence on prepping specific meals might not take into account her current capabilities. It's possible he's not in the wrong for wanting help, but maybe he's being too demanding given her circumstances. The key here is communication and understanding each other's limits. If he had discussed it more and been open to alternatives, that might have helped. But as it stands, he's not entirely at fault, but there's room for empathy on both sides.\n"
