It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. \n\nSo the scenario is the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband will have to handle all the chores and cooking. Normally, the wife does the cooking, and the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals for the week so he doesn't have to deal with the stress of cooking for picky kids. She got upset, thinking it's too much work. He thinks it's reasonable because she's going on a trip and he needs the help.\n\nFirst, I should consider the husband's perspective. He's asking for help to manage a situation that's new and potentially overwhelming. Since the wife usually handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences better, prepping meals would make his week easier. It's a practical request to prevent meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right. Also, the wife is going away, so asking her to do something before she leaves makes sense. It's not like he's asking her to do it during her trip.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that meal prepping for a week is a lot of extra work on top of her own preparations for the trip. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels that the husband should take more responsibility. But the husband isn't asking her to take on more during the trip; he's asking her to prepare before she leaves. \n\nIs the husband's request unreasonable? Since the wife is leaving, and the request is made in advance, it's a way to share the burden. The husband isn't being selfish; he's trying to manage responsibilities. The wife's response that she can't do it might be valid if it's truly too much, but the husband's request isn't unreasonable. He's acknowledging that he can do it, but it's harder for him. So asking for help is reasonable. \n\nI don't see anything in the situation that makes the husband's request unfair. He's not making her do it during her trip, but before she leaves. He's also considering the kids' needs. The wife might have valid reasons for not wanting to prep, but the husband isn't in the wrong for making a practical request to help him manage. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
