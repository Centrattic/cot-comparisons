She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The key points here are the situation: the wife is going on a week-long trip, the husband will be handling all the chores and cooking for the kids. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife usually handles cooking because she knows their preferences better. The husband asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The husband is trying to prepare for his first full week alone with the kids, which is a big responsibility. He's asking for help from his spouse who is more experienced in cooking. But the wife is going away, so she's not there to manage the cooking during the trip. The question is whether it's reasonable to ask her to prep meals before she leaves.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's request is practical. He's asking for help that he can't get once she's gone. Since the wife knows the kids' preferences better, prepping meals would make his week easier. It's a temporary extra task for her before her trip. On the other hand, the wife might feel that meal prepping for a week is an added burden, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself and doesn't want to take on more work right before leaving.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a point to consider. She got upset, which might indicate that the request is seen as unreasonable or an added stressor. However, the husband's reasoning is that he wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids if they don't get their usual meals. His intention is to maintain stability for the kids, which is valid.\n\nI should also think about the general norms in relationships. Partners often help each other with tasks that are challenging. If the wife normally handles cooking, it's logical that she would assist in maintaining that responsibility even when she's not there. But it's also important to consider if the request is being made at a convenient time. If the wife is already busy with her own preparations, adding a week's worth of meal prep might be too much.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the husband and wife have a prior agreement or discussion about responsibilities when one is away? If not, the husband's request might seem sudden. However, given that it's the first time she's away since the kids were born, maybe this is a new situation they need to navigate together.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is asking for help that he can't get from anyone else. The wife is the one who knows the kids' preferences, so it's logical that she preps the meals. But the wife might feel that since she's not there, she shouldn't have to prepare for it. It's a bit of a grey area. The husband's position is that he's trying to make the week manageable, which is reasonable. The wife's position is that the request is too much work, which is also valid if she's already stressed.\n\nI think the key here is whether the request is unreasonable. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, but if it's doable before her trip, maybe it's a fair ask. However, if she's already overwhelmed with her own travel prep, that's another factor. The husband's intention is to maintain the kids' routine, which is important for their well-being. The wife's refusal might stem from feeling that the task is too much, but maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all. But the husband is asking if he's in the wrong, so based on the information given, it's a judgment call. The husband is trying to manage his responsibilities, so he's probably not in the wrong, but it's a sensitive situation where communication is key.\n"
