It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation: the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is asking her to prep dinners for the week because he's not as experienced with the kids' picky eating. She gets upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggests he just make sandwiches if needed. The husband feels it's fair to ask since she's leaving for a week.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The husband is preparing for a challenging week by asking for help, while the wife feels the request is excessive. \n\nI should consider both sides. The husband's perspective: he's taking on a big responsibility with the kids and work. He's not confident in his cooking, and the kids are used to their mom's meals. Meal prepping would make his week easier. The wife's perspective: she's going on a trip, maybe she's already stressed about being away, and she sees the prep as extra work on top of her trip preparations. Maybe she feels it's unfair to add that to her plate before leaving.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the husband could have asked for something less burdensome, like a few meals instead of a full week. But he specifically mentions that the kids are picky and not having the right food could cause meltdowns. That's a valid concern. Also, he's taking on her half of the chores, so maybe the request is reasonable to balance the workload during her absence.\n\nHowever, the wife's reaction might be about feeling overwhelmed. If she's already preparing for her trip, asking for meal prep adds stress. Maybe the husband didn't consider that. But he did phrase it as a request, not a demand. She could have said she's okay with making some meals but not all. The fact that she dismissed it by saying he can make sandwiches might indicate she's being dismissive, but maybe she's overwhelmed.\n\nIn terms of fairness, asking someone to help out before they go away isn't inherently wrong. If the wife had agreed, no issue. But she felt it's too much. So, the husband's request might be reasonable, but maybe he didn't communicate it well. Alternatively, the wife's refusal is because she's already stretched thin.\n\nThe question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. Since he's asking for help to manage the situation, and he's not making her go on the trip or taking away her responsibilities, I think he's not in the wrong. The wife's refusal is her choice, and he's not being unreasonable in his request. So answer B.\n"
