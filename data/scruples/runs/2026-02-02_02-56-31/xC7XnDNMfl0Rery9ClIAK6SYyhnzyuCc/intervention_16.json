      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time she's been away since the kids were born. The user is taking over her chores, including cooking, which is usually her responsibility. The kids are picky, and she knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. He's confused because he thinks it's reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nNow, the user feels it's fair to ask because she's taking a week off, and he's handling the work. The wife's response was negative, suggesting maybe she's overburdened or doesn't want the extra task. \n\nPossible angles: \n\n1. **Communication**: Did he approach the request in a way that considered her feelings? Maybe he didn't consider if she's already stressed about the trip or if meal prepping is an extra burden on top of her packing and travel prep.\n\n2. **Expectation of shared responsibilities**: Cooking is her usual role, but maybe he should be stepping up more, especially since he's taking over her duties. However, asking for prepped meals could make sense to ease the transition for the kids.\n\n3. **Wife's reaction**: Her getting upset might indicate she feels overwhelmed or that the request is unfair. Maybe the user didn't check in on her stress levels before making the request.\n\n4. **Alternatives**: He offered sandwiches as a fallback, but maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps he could have asked for specific meals instead of all of them, or they could have compromised on the number of meals prepped.\n\n5. **Fairness**: Since she's going, is it fair to ask for her to prep? It's a way to maintain consistency for the kids, so maybe it's reasonable. But if she's already dealing with her own trip preparations, adding meal prep might be too much.\n\nConsidering all this, the user's intention is to make things easier during her absence. However, the approach might not have considered her current workload or stress. The wife's reaction suggests the request might have been a bit much, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. So, maybe the user is not in the wrong, but the way the request was made could be improved. However, the core issue is whether it's fair to ask her to do meal prep. Since she's going on a trip, it's plausible that she's already busy, so maybe the user should have considered that. Alternatively, since she's the one leaving, it's reasonable to ask for help to manage the household in her absence. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The user's reasoning is valid, but the wife's reaction suggests possible miscommunication or differing expectations. The answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong, but they could have approached it differently. The key is that both parties need to communicate better about their capacities and expectations.\n"
