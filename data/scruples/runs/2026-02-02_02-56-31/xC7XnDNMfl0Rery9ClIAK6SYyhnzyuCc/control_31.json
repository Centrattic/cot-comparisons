It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time she's been away from the kids since they were born. The husband has to take over her chores, including cooking, which the wife usually does. The kids are picky eaters, and he thinks the wife knows their preferences better. So he asked her to prep dinners for the week. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The husband is asking for help to manage a situation where he's taking on extra responsibilities. Meal prepping might be a reasonable request since the wife is going away, and she's the one who usually handles cooking. However, she might feel that the request is adding more work to her already busy schedule before her trip. \n\nI need to consider if the husband's request is reasonable. He's not asking her to stay and help; he's asking her to prepare in advance. Since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences, prepping meals could prevent issues when she's away. On the other hand, she might have other things to do before her trip and feel that this is an added burden. \n\nIs it unfair to ask her to prep meals? Maybe not. Since she's the one who usually does the cooking, and the husband wants to maintain consistency for the kids, meal prepping could be a practical solution. But she might feel that he's not considering her workload, leading to her upset reaction. However, the husband's intention is to make things easier for himself, not to add stress for her. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should have discussed it earlier or found another solution, like hiring help or adjusting his own cooking plan. But since he's the one who asked and she's the one who got upset, the question is whether his request is unreasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. His request is practical given the circumstances. He's trying to manage his responsibilities while she's away. It's possible she could have said no, but the request itself isn't unreasonable. The issue might be more about communication or differing expectations rather than the author being wrong.\n"
