      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip, and she got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife is going on a week-long trip, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and the kids are picky eaters. The husband asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she found it too much work and suggested he can make sandwiches instead.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he's asking her to prepare because she knows the kids' food preferences better. He doesn't want meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual food. He feels it's fair to ask her since she's taking the trip. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The husband is trying to manage the workload while she's away. It's his first time handling everything alone, so he's probably stressed. He's asking for help in a way that makes sense for the kids' well-being. On the other hand, the wife might feel that prepping meals is an extra burden, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's overwhelmed with her own plans or the idea of being away from the kids, leading to her emotional reaction.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to plan ahead to make sure things run smoothly. If she's responsible for cooking normally, it's logical he would ask her to handle the meal prep. But maybe the request was too much, or perhaps the way he asked was off. However, the scenario doesn't mention any specific harsh language or ultimatums. He's asking for her help to avoid problems at home. The wife's response seems to indicate she feels it's too much, but the husband is trying to be proactive.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the husband didn't consider her stress about the trip. If this is her first time away, she might be anxious, and adding meal prep could add pressure. The husband might not realize how much she's already dreading the trip. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's making a reasonable request based on his needs and the kids' habits, and she's the one declining, it's more about the wife's refusal rather than the husband's request. Unless there's a history of the wife not contributing, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have offered to help with prep or found another solution. But the scenario says he can do it, but he's worried about the kids' reactions. So, he's trying to prevent issues. It's a common situation where couples have different responsibilities, and adjusting during absences is part of teamwork. The wife might need to compromise, but the husband's request seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
