It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that their wife is going away for a week, and they need to handle everything alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and the kids are picky. He wants her to prep meals, but she's upset, saying it's too much work and offers to make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user's reasoning is that since the wife is leaving, it's reasonable to ask her to prep meals to ease his load. The wife feels it's too much to ask, especially since she's already going on a trip and might be busy. \n\nI should think about whether his request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week could be time-consuming, especially if she's already dealing with packing and other pre-trip tasks. On the other hand, the user is juggling work and childcare alone, so it's understandable he wants to minimize stress. The wife's offer to make sandwiches might be a compromise, but the user prefers the kids' usual meals to avoid meltdowns. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the user could have asked for a few meals instead of all, or offered to take turns with some prep. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed by an additional task before her trip. The user's intent is to manage the situation better, but he might not have considered her workload or feelings. \n\nThe key points are mutual understanding and communication. The user's request isn't inherently wrong, but the way it was presented might have come across as a demand rather than a collaborative effort. If he approached it as a team effort and considered her capacity, maybe the response would be different. Since the wife is upset, it's possible the user didn't consider her perspective enough. However, wanting support from her before the trip isn't unreasonable. I'm leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) but with the caveat that better communication could help.\n"
