It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband is asking his wife to meal prep before her trip because he's worried about handling the kids' picky eating alone for a week. She got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is dealing with a lot when his wife is away: work, chores, and cooking for picky kids. He's asking for help in a way that makes sense for him to manage everything. His request is specific\u2014meal prepping for dinners. He's not asking her to do everything else, just the cooking part. He's acknowledging that she knows the kids' preferences better, which is a valid point.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is going on a trip for the first time since the kids were born. She might be stressed about the trip itself, and the meal prepping could add extra pressure. Maybe she's worried about the time or effort required, or perhaps she feels it's unfair that she's being asked to do this when she's trying to enjoy her trip. She's also offering an alternative (sandwiches), which might be simpler for her to prepare but not ideal for the kids.\n\nNow, considering their relationship dynamics. The husband is asking for support to manage a challenging situation. Meal prepping is a reasonable request if it helps him cope. However, the wife's reaction is valid too if she feels overwhelmed. The key here is whether the husband's request is unreasonable. Since he's asking for something specific that she can do before her trip, and it's to help with a known challenge (picky eaters), it seems like a fair request. The wife might be overreacting if meal prepping is feasible for her. But if it's genuinely too much for her, especially with the trip being a time for her to relax, then maybe the husband is overstepping.\n\nBut the husband's reasoning is about avoiding meltdowns from the kids over unfamiliar food. That's a practical concern. The wife's alternative of sandwiches might not be sufficient if the kids are used to more varied meals. The husband isn't asking for something extravagant, just consistency. So, he's trying to maintain stability for the kids. \n\nIs he in the wrong? If the meal prep is a reasonable request and the wife is refusing without good reason, then the husband isn't in the wrong. But if the wife has valid reasons for not being able to do it, then maybe he's being a bit demanding. However, the wife could have communicated her limitations better. The husband's request is based on practicality, not being a burden. So, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
