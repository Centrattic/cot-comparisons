It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is usually her responsibility, and he's not confident in his ability to manage the kids' picky eating. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request is based on practicality and wanting to ensure the kids eat well without issues. He's taking on her chores while she's away, so asking her to help by prepping meals seems reasonable since she knows the kids' preferences better. But the wife feels it's an extra burden on top of her trip prep, hence her frustration.\n\nIs the husband overstepping? Well, he's not forcing her; he's making a request. However, the wife might feel that since she's already going on a trip, the prep work adds stress. Maybe there's a lack of communication about the actual workload. The husband might not realize how much meal prepping would add to her existing tasks. Alternatively, the wife might be dismissive of his genuine concerns about the kids' needs.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about balance. If the wife is capable and the request is reasonable, then it's not his fault. But if the request is unreasonable given her current situation, he might be in the wrong. However, since he's the one staying home and handling the kids, ensuring meals are covered is important. The key is whether the request is realistic. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, especially if the kids are picky, so maybe the husband didn't consider that aspect. But he's trying to cover his bases. \n\nThe wife's response of making sandwiches might be a way to avoid the prep, but the husband's concern about meltdowns from unfamiliar food is valid. So, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's asking for help in a way to make the transition easier, and the wife's reaction could be due to stress about her trip rather than the request itself. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). He's making a reasonable request based on his needs, and it's up to the wife to decide if she can do it. The husband isn't forcing her, just expressing his needs. The wife's frustration might stem from other pressures, but the husband isn't at fault here.\n"
