It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that she's going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores. Cooking is her usual responsibility, and he wants her to prep meals so he's not stressed with picky eaters.\n\nSo, the key points here. First, the wife is taking a trip, which is her first time away since the kids were born. The husband is taking over all her chores. Cooking is her responsibility, and he's not confident in handling it because the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. He asks her to prep meals for the week, but she gets upset, saying it's too much work and suggests he can just make sandwiches if it's too hard. He feels it's fair to ask since she's the one leaving.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Well, he's asking for help to manage the workload during her absence. It's reasonable to expect that someone who normally handles a task would prepare to make things easier for the other person. But maybe she feels that meal prepping for a week is too much on top of her own trip preparations. There's a balance here between his needs and her capacity.\n\nHe's not blaming her entirely; he acknowledges he can do it but is concerned about the kids' reactions. She might feel that the request is adding stress to her trip. Perhaps there's a lack of communication or understanding of her workload. Maybe they could have found a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all. But does that mean he's in the wrong? Or is it a misunderstanding?\n\nI think he's coming from a place of wanting to manage the situation without conflict. He's not being unreasonable in asking for help, but maybe the way he framed the request or the assumption that she should do it might be the issue. However, given the context, asking her to prep meals because she's the primary cook and knows the kids' preferences seems valid. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The answer might be B (No).\n"
