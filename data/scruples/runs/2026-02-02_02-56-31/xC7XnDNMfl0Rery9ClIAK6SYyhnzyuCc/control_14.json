It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time the author will be handling the kids and chores alone. The author usually relies on the wife for cooking, especially since the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's overwhelmed with taking over chores and working, and meal prepping would help him avoid stress and potential kid meltdowns from not having their usual food. He doesn't think it's unfair since she's taking the trip. The wife's response is that it's too much work for her, implying she doesn't feel it's reasonable, and she's offering an alternative (sandwiches) if needed.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual support in a relationship. The author is trying to manage his workload and ensure the kids are taken care of. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding to her workload before her trip, especially if she's already preparing for her absence. Maybe she didn't expect to take on extra work right before leaving, which could be why she got upset. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to plan ahead, which is reasonable. But he might not have considered her feelings about the additional preparation. Relationships require balance. If the wife is already stressed about her trip or has other things to do, adding meal prep could be too much. The author could have approached the conversation differently, perhaps discussing options or compromises. However, the wife's reaction might also be a bit dismissive by suggesting sandwiches, which could minimize the author's concerns. \n\nBut the core question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's seeking help and hasn't forced her to do anything, but rather made a request, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, maybe he should have considered that she might not want to take on the extra work. The wife might need to communicate her capacity better. In this case, the author's request seems reasonable, but the wife's reaction might stem from her own stress. So the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
