It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the situation is that she's going away for a week, and he's asking her to prepare meals so he can handle the kids and work. She got upset because she thought it's too much work, and he's confused because he thinks it's fair since she's the one taking the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Cooking is her responsibility, but he can do it. The kids are picky, and she knows their preferences better. He's asking her to prep meals to make his week easier. She's upset because it's too much work, but maybe she feels it's an extra burden before her trip. Alternatively, maybe she's already stressed about leaving and doesn't want to take on more tasks.\n\nHe argues it's fair because she's the one going away. But maybe he's not considering her feelings. Is he being reasonable? Well, meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming and tiring. If she's already preparing for a trip, adding meal prep might be overwhelming. On the other hand, he's trying to get support to manage the kids' meals, which he's not as familiar with.\n\nIt's about mutual support in a relationship. If they usually share chores, maybe he should offer to take on some of her responsibilities. But he's already taking over her half of the chores. Meal prep is an extra step. Maybe he should compromise. He could offer to help with the meal prep, or maybe she can just do a few key meals instead of all. But he's insisting she does all of them, which she finds too much.\n\nThe key point is whether his request is reasonable. He's not wrong for wanting help, but he might be wrong in assuming she has to do all the prep without considering her workload. So, maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong), but there's room for understanding her perspective. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer is B because he's trying to manage his responsibilities, and the fault isn't entirely his.\n"
