On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. They have a week-long trip where she'll be away from the kids for the first time since they were born. The user is taking over her chores, including cooking, which he mentions is her responsibility. The kids are picky eaters, and he knows his wife's better at preparing meals they like. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week. She got upset, saying that's too much work and offered making sandwiches instead if it's too hard.\n\nHmm. So the user's reasoning is that since she's going away, it's reasonable to ask her to prep meals in advance to make his week easier. He's concerned about the kids' picky eating and possible meltdowns if the food is different. The wife's response was negative, thinking it's too much work. The user doesn't see it as unfair because she's taking a full week off.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, but it's a common strategy some people use to make things easier. However, the wife is the one who's going away, so maybe she's already stressed about the trip. The user is asking her to do extra work before she leaves, which might be adding to her stress. Also, if cooking is her responsibility, maybe the user should take on a bit more now that she's not there. But he mentioned he can do it, but he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences.\n\nIs it fair to expect her to prep for a week's meals? It depends on their usual dynamics. If they've never done meal prepping before, this might be a new and burdensome task. Alternatively, if she's used to doing things that way, maybe it's reasonable. The user's argument is that he's asking for help to manage the situation during her absence, which is logical. However, the wife might feel that the request is imposing, especially if she's already preparing for her trip, which comes with its own stress.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Did they discuss this in a way that considered each other's perspectives? The user might have approached it without considering her current workload or stress. The wife's response of offering sandwiches suggests she's trying to compromise but feels overwhelmed. Maybe the user should have asked earlier or offered to help with some prepping. Alternatively, maybe he should accept the sandwiches since she's not willing to do more.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's trying to manage his responsibilities and prevent potential issues with the kids. On the other, he's adding a task to her plate right before a trip. It depends on their usual responsibilities and how the request was made. Since he's asking if he's in the wrong, and the wife is the one who's upset, it's possible he overstepped, especially if she didn't agree. But if he's trying to make things easier and she's refusing, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The key is whether the request was realistic and communicated respectfully.\n\nIn conclusion, maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to make things easier, but he could have handled the request differently. However, since the wife is taking a break, perhaps expecting her to prep meals isn't fair. It's a toss-up. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong, because it's a reasonable request to ask someone to help before they leave. But others might see it as A, he is in the wrong for not considering her workload. But given the information, B seems more likely.\n"
