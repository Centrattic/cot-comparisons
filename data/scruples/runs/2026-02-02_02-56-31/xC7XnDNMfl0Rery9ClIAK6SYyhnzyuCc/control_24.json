It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to meal prep for the week so he can manage the kids and chores while she's away. She gets upset and says it's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that cooking is the wife's usual responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He wants to avoid meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual food. He's also taking on her half of the chores plus work, so he's probably feeling the added stress. He's asking for a favor before she leaves, which could be seen as reasonable since she's the one who will be away and maybe has the capacity to prepare ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is taking a break and might be feeling that being asked to prep meals adds extra work before her trip. She might feel it's unfair or that she's already stressed about leaving. Maybe she's concerned about the timing or the effort required. The husband might not be considering her perspective here.\n\nBut the key points are: He's asking her to do something before she leaves, which is when she's still at home and presumably has time. The request is specific and practical. He's not making her cook while she's away, just prepping in advance. Since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences, it makes sense. He's not forcing her, but he's also not unreasonable to ask for help considering the circumstances.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The husband's request seems reasonable given the situation. He's trying to manage a big life change (a week alone with kids) and is seeking support. The wife's reaction might stem from stress or feeling overwhelmed, but the husband isn't doing anything wrong by asking for help. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
