She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the husband is wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and the kids are picky. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nSo, the main points here. The husband is asking for help to manage without her. He's taking on a lot more responsibility. The wife feels the request is too much. But why is she upset? Maybe she's stressed about the trip, or she feels the request is unfair. He thinks it's reasonable since she's leaving, but she's the one who normally handles the cooking, so she knows the kids' preferences better.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to prepare and avoid meltdowns from the kids. He's acknowledging that he can manage but it's harder. The wife's response was dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, which might not be the best solution. But he's asking for her to do something before the trip, which is a reasonable request to make their lives easier during her absence. \n\nHe's not asking for her to do his work while she's gone; he's asking her to prepare ahead so he doesn't have to manage everything during the trip. Since she's the one who's leaving, it's logical she would want to set things up. Maybe she's feeling overwhelmed by the prep work, especially if she's busy with packing or other pre-trip tasks. However, the husband's intention is to make things easier for himself, which is understandable.\n\nI don't see a clear wrong here. The husband is trying to prepare for a challenging week. The wife's reaction might stem from stress, but the request itself isn't unreasonable. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
