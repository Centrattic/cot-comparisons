It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, which is the first time since the kids were born. The user will be handling all the chores and cooking. Cooking is the wife's usual responsibility, and the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested just making sandwiches if needed.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The user is handling a lot more responsibility during the trip, so asking for help makes sense. The wife is responsible for cooking normally, so it's logical to rely on her for meal prep. But she's taking a week off, which might be her first break, so maybe she's stressed about that too. She might feel the request is adding more work before her trip, which could be overwhelming. \n\nBut the user's reasoning is that he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences and that the kids might have meltdowns without their usual meals. It's a valid concern. The wife's response of making sandwiches seems dismissive. The user isn't asking for something unreasonable, just planning ahead to manage the upcoming week. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user should have offered to compensate her in some way or acknowledged her effort. Maybe he could have offered to help with prep or take on more tasks during her trip to show appreciation. But he's not asking for anything else, just the meal prep. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep before leaving? Since she's responsible for cooking normally, it's a shared responsibility. But when she's away, he's taking over, so asking her to plan ahead is reasonable. Maybe the issue is communication\u2014she might feel it's too much, but he's trying to prevent problems. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. He's trying to plan and manage the situation, while the wife is resistant. It's a common issue in partnerships where responsibilities shift. The user's request is practical, even if the wife's reaction is emotional. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
