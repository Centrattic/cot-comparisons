It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that she's going away for a week, and he'll be handling everything alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and he's worried about the kids' picky eating. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is asking for help to manage his own stress and ensure the kids eat well. It's reasonable to want some support when taking over responsibilities. But the wife is going away, so she's taking time off, and maybe she feels the request is adding extra work before her trip. Maybe she's already preparing for her trip, so meal prepping adds to her current workload.\n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals? Well, she's the one who's used to cooking, so her prepping might make things easier. But it's also a significant task, especially if she's already busy. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. The husband's intention is good\u2014he's trying to avoid stress. The wife's reaction might be about feeling overwhelmed rather than not wanting to help. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe the husband didn't consider the timing of his request. If she's preparing for her trip, asking her to prep meals might add to her stress. Alternatively, maybe the husband could have asked earlier or found a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all. But the wife's refusal might also be valid if she's already stressed about the trip.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's trying to manage the household. On the other, the request might be too much for her. Since he's the one who's not used to cooking, it's understandable, but maybe he should have considered her workload. However, since it's her first time away, maybe she's already dealing with her own anxieties. The answer might depend on their usual communication. But given the info, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong because his intention is to make things manageable, but he could have approached it differently. So the answer is B.\n"
