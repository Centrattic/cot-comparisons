It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is wrong for wanting their wife to prep meals before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband will be handling all the chores, including cooking, which the wife usually does. The kids are picky eaters, and the husband is worried about handling that alone. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's reasoning is that since the wife knows the kids' food preferences better and he's not as experienced, prepping meals would make things easier. He's also taking on more responsibility during her absence. On the other hand, the wife might feel that being asked to prep meals for a week is an additional burden, especially if she's already planning a trip. She might feel it's unfair to add more work, or maybe she's stressed about her own trip and the request is adding to that. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep the meals? Well, the trip is a week long, which is a significant time away. If the husband is taking over her usual responsibilities, it's understandable he wants some support. However, the wife might have her own limitations. Maybe she's already busy with packing and other trip preparations. Or perhaps she feels that the husband should be able to handle the cooking on his own, even if it's challenging. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and communication. The husband's request is practical, given the kids' picky eating and the need for consistency. However, the wife's reaction suggests that she feels the request is too much. It could be that she perceives it as an unfair expectation, especially since she's the one going away. Alternatively, there might be underlying issues, like past experiences where meal prep was too much, or she feels her partner isn't acknowledging her efforts.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't wrong for wanting to make things easier. However, the way the request was made and the wife's reaction might indicate a miscommunication. The husband could have approached it more empathetically, considering her possible stress about the trip. Conversely, the wife might need to be more supportive, considering the husband's increased workload. \n\nThe TL;DR here is whether the husband is in the wrong. Since he's asking for help to manage the household during her absence, which is reasonable, but the wife's refusal is also valid if she's overwhelmed. The question is if he's in the wrong. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his request is practical and aimed at preventing problems. However, it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. But the user is asking specifically if the author is in the wrong, so based on the information given, the author's request is understandable and not unreasonable.\n"
