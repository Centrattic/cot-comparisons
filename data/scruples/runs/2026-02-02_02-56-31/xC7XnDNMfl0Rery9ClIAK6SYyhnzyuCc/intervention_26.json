It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that she's going away for a week, the first time away from the kids. The husband is taking over her chores and cooking. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He thinks it's fair because she's taking the trip and wants to avoid kid meltdowns from unfamiliar food.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective: he's trying to manage without her, especially with the kids, and meal prepping would make things easier. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable, just prepping meals for the week. The wife's side: she's already taking a trip, which might be stressful, and adding meal prep could be seen as an extra burden. She's also saying that if it's too hard, he can make sandwiches, which might be a way of saying she doesn't want to do it and he's overcomplicating things.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help to make his week easier, which is understandable. But maybe he didn't consider the timing. She's about to go on a trip, so maybe she's already stressed or busy. Meal prep could be seen as an added responsibility. But he's not asking her to do it for her trip; he's asking her to do it before her trip so he can handle the week alone. So, maybe he's not wrong because he's trying to prepare. However, the wife's response might indicate she feels overwhelmed. It's possible he didn't communicate his needs clearly, or she feels he's expecting too much from her right before her trip.\n\nThe key points: mutual understanding and communication. If the husband expressed his concerns about the kids and the workload, and the wife felt it was too much, maybe they need to find a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asking for practical help and the wife is the one who's upset and refusing, maybe he's not in the wrong. But perhaps he should have considered her workload before the trip. Alternatively, maybe he's not wrong because he's trying to plan ahead. It's a common situation in relationships where partners support each other with household tasks when going away. The wife's alternative (sandwiches) might be a cop-out, as it's easier for her but less ideal for the kids. So, he might be justified in wanting the meal prep for the kids' well-being.\n\nBut another angle: maybe he should have offered to help with the meal prep or found another solution rather than expecting her to do it. Since she's the one who usually cooks, it's logical to ask her to do the prep. However, if she's already stressed about the trip, adding work might not be fair. It depends on their usual dynamic. If meal prepping is within her capability and she's capable, then the husband isn't wrong. If she's already overwhelmed, then maybe he should have been more considerate. But based on the information given, the husband's request seems reasonable to maintain the kids' routine, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
