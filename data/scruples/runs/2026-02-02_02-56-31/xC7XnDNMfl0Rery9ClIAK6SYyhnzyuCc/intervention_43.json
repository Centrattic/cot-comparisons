It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that she's going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids' meals alone. He normally asks her to cook since she knows the kids' preferences better, but she's upset about the prep work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request is to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. He's taking on more responsibilities during her absence. However, the wife feels it's too much work. Maybe she's already preparing for her trip and has her own tasks, so adding meal prep might be overwhelming. Did he consider her workload? \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that she's the one leaving, so it's fair to ask for help. But is it fair to expect her to prep meals if she's already stressed about the trip? Also, maybe he could have offered to help with the prep or suggested alternatives. Since he didn't mention that, maybe that's where he's wrong. \n\nThe wife's reaction is valid. If she feels the request is excessive, especially if she's already dealing with packing and other trip preparations, she might have a right to say it's too much. The husband might not have considered her perspective fully. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's concern about the kids' meltdowns is real. He's trying to prevent problems by ensuring meals are ready. But maybe there's a middle ground. Instead of a week of prepped dinners, maybe a few key meals or using frozen meals. But he didn't mention trying alternatives, so maybe he's not considering her limitations.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband was reasonable in his request. If he didn't account for her workload or offer assistance, then he might be in the wrong. However, if he genuinely tried to communicate his needs without overstepping, maybe not. The key factors are communication, consideration of her situation, and willingness to compromise. Since the wife felt upset, it's possible he didn't balance their responsibilities fairly. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her perspective and the added stress of her trip.\n"
