It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to prep meals before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids' meals since she usually takes care of that. He asked her to meal prep, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he can just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking for the kids, who are picky, and he wants to avoid meltdowns. He's taking over her chores plus working, so meal prep would help. The wife might feel that being asked to prep meals before a trip is an extra burden, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself or has other things to do. She might also feel that the husband isn't sharing the load equally, or that he's not confident in his ability to handle the cooking, which could be a point of frustration.\n\nIs the husband's request reasonable? Meal prepping can be time-consuming, and if the wife is already busy with her own preparations, adding that might be overwhelming. On the other hand, the husband is asking for help to manage the kids' needs, which is a valid concern. It's possible that the wife might feel her needs for some rest or not wanting to sacrifice her trip time are being overlooked.\n\nThe husband might not be in the wrong, since he's trying to plan ahead to avoid stress. However, the way he approached the request might matter. If he came across as not considering her workload or not being open to other solutions, that could be an issue. The wife's response suggests she felt it was too much, so maybe the husband should have considered alternatives or communicated better.\n\nBut in terms of the request itself, wanting the kids to have familiar food is understandable. The husband is trying to manage his own stress and the kids' well-being. However, expecting her to prep meals might not account for her perspective. Maybe he could have offered to help with the prep or found a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all. The fact that the wife is upset indicates that the request was perceived as unreasonable, which could mean the husband didn't take her feelings into account enough.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the husband isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for the wife's feelings as well. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors are mutual respect and communication. If the husband's request was made without considering her workload or feelings, then maybe he's partially at fault. But since his intention is to manage the situation better, maybe not. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that better communication could have helped.\n"
