The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 17-year-old high schooler called their friend's mom because they found out the friend was driving under the influence (DUI) after a party. The friend was smoking, drinking, and texting while driving, which is super dangerous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author saw their friend's Snapchat stories showing her doing risky stuff. They tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then the author called her mom to prevent a possible accident. The friend ended up getting grounded, losing her phone and car, and even punched the author. Now the author feels guilty and their friendship is ruined.\n\nSo, the key question is: was the author wrong to call the mom? Let's look at both sides. On one hand, DUI is a serious issue. The author was trying to prevent a potential tragedy, which is a responsible action. They might have felt it was necessary to protect their friend's safety. Especially since they were a minor and the friend was also under 18, so both are legally underage. The parents have a duty to intervene, so the author might have stepped into that role temporarily.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the friend's parent without permission. Privacy is a factor here. The friend might have felt her privacy was invaded, leading to the backlash. Also, the friend was upset because her parents took away her privileges, and the author became the target of her anger. However, the friend's actions were dangerous, and the author's intent was to prevent harm.\n\nThe fact that there was a MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) presentation at school the same day adds context. It shows that the school was emphasizing the dangers of DUI, which the author was presumably aware of. This might have reinforced the author's belief that they needed to act.\n\nThe consequences for the friend were severe, but the author had to weigh the immediate danger against the social repercussions. The friend's decision to punch the author shows a lack of appreciation for the author's intentions, but the author's action was aimed at preventing a much worse outcome.\n\nIn legal terms, in many places, even for minors, attempting to prevent someone from driving under the influence could be seen as a responsible action to prevent harm. The author didn't act out of malice but concern. The fact that the friend's parents thanked the author, even if just briefly, suggests they recognized the action's validity.\n\nHowever, the social fallout is significant. The author lost a friend and faced hostility from others. But the core issue is whether the action was right in terms of safety. The author's decision was morally and ethically sound in terms of prioritizing safety over privacy in this case. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
