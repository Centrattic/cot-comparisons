  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person did the wrong thing by calling their friend's mom about driving under the influence. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: the person is 17, and their friend, who was 16 at the time, had been partying, drinking, and smoking. The friend drove to the party and later was seen driving while using drugs, texting, and drinking. The person tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused, saying it was too expensive. Then they saw evidence on social media that she was still driving unsafely. So the person called her mom to prevent a potential accident.\n\nNow, the question is whether the person was in the wrong. On one hand, they were trying to prevent a dangerous situation. DUI is a serious issue, and if the friend had crashed, it could have been fatal. The person's actions might have saved lives. MADD presentations at school emphasize the dangers of drunk driving, so they were acting in line with that message.\n\nOn the other hand, the person didn't confront the friend directly or involve other authorities. They went straight to her parents, which might have been unexpected. The friend was upset and even physically attacked the person. The friend's friends also criticized the person for being a \"dick,\" suggesting that in their social circle, such behavior isn't taken seriously.\n\nBut the key point is intent. The person's intention was to prevent harm. They weren't trying to get their friend in trouble for fun. They had a responsibility to act given the potential consequences. Even though the friend was angry and there was a fallout, the person's actions were driven by concern for safety.\n\nAlso, the friend was underage and had been engaging in reckless behavior. The person had already tried to help by offering an Uber but was ignored. So, escalating the situation by contacting the parents was a reasonable step. The parents did take appropriate action, grounding her and taking away her car, which might have led to positive consequences in the long run.\n\nHowever, the person might have considered other steps first, like involving school authorities or law enforcement. But given the immediate danger of a friend driving drunk, contacting a parent was a direct way to ensure safety.\n\nThe friend's reaction and the social backlash from her friends suggest that the person was seen as a snitch, but that's more about the social dynamics than the rightness of the action. The person isn't in the wrong for trying to prevent a potential tragedy. The consequences for the friend were necessary to stop her from endangering herself and others.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person was acting in the interest of safety and preventing a possible accident. Even though it caused a conflict, their intention was good. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
