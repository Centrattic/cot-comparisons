The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they thought the friend was driving under the influence. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe user is 17, and the friend was 16 at the time. The party got big, with people drinking and doing drugs. The user saw the friend chugging vodka, smoking, and then driving. They tried to text her to call an Uber but she didn't respond. Then she said Uber was too expensive and hung up. Later, the user saw videos on Snapchat of her driving while smoking and drunk. They called her mom, which led to her getting grounded and other punishments. Now the friend is angry and some classmates are upset, calling the user a dick.\n\nSo, the user is torn between feeling they did the right thing to prevent a possible accident and feeling guilty for getting her in trouble. They also mention a MADD presentation the same day, which probably highlighted the dangers of drunk driving.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, drunk driving is a serious risk. The user tried to intervene when their friend was in a dangerous situation. Even though the friend was upset, the user's action might have prevented an accident. However, the method of confronting the issue by contacting the parents could be seen as overstepping, especially if the friend didn't want that interference. But given the severity of the risk, many would argue that the user did the right thing to prevent potential harm.\n\nThe friend's reaction of punching the user shows how angry she was, but that doesn't change the fact that she was in a dangerous situation. The user's intention was to help, even if the outcome led to conflict. The classmates who were also doing similar things might be envious or upset that the user took action while they didn't.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral responsibility, in many places, reporting someone who is about to drive drunk can be a responsible action. The user might have acted out of concern for the friend's safety. However, the way they chose to handle it by contacting the parents instead of maybe calling the police or another authority might be debatable. But given the user's age and the situation, calling a parent was a reasonable step.\n\nThe key here is the potential harm versus the actual harm done. If the user didn't act and an accident happened, the guilt would be heavier. By acting, even if it caused some personal fallout, they might have saved lives. The friend's parents appreciated the call, as they took action, which suggests they agreed with the user's decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user probably wasn't in the wrong. They acted to prevent a serious situation. The friend's anger and the other classmates' reactions don't negate the user's intent to protect their friend. The answer should be B (I am not in the wrong).\n"
