  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom to stop her from driving under the influence. So, first, I need to break down the situation step by step.\n\nThe user is 17, and there was a party that got big with drinking and drugs. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The user saw her drinking and smoking on social media, knew she was driving, and tried to call an Uber. When she refused, the user called her mom. The friend got grounded, her car was sold, and people at school are upset, calling the user names. The friend even punched them.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the user overstepped by involving the mom. On one hand, the friend was driving while under the influence, which is a serious safety risk. The user was trying to prevent a potential accident. DUI can lead to fatal consequences, so acting to stop that might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue that they were trying to help. However, the friend was an adult in her eyes? Wait, the friend is 16 now, but the event was when she was 16, and the user is 17. Depending on the legal age of consent or the state's laws, maybe the friend wasn't an adult yet. But legally, in most places, 18 is the age of majority, so the friend was a minor. So the user might have a responsibility to ensure her safety since they're both minors.\n\nBut the user didn't directly stop the friend themselves, they went through her parents. Is that the right approach? Sometimes, teenagers might not listen to their peers, but calling the parents could be seen as a responsible action to prevent harm. However, some might say it's meddling or violating privacy, depending on the context.\n\nThe friend was upset and the user lost their friend. The user is conflicted because they want to feel right for preventing a possible tragedy but also hurt their friend and got her in trouble.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, preventing someone from driving drunk is usually considered a good thing. The user's actions could be seen as trying to protect the friend and others from harm. However, the method of involving the parents might be seen as overstepping if the user didn't directly confront the friend first. But in this case, the friend was already ignoring the user's attempts to get a ride (Uber), so maybe the user had no other option left.\n\nThe fact that there was a MADD presentation at school the same day adds context, showing that the school was emphasizing the dangers of drunk driving. The user's action aligns with that message.\n\nThe friend's reaction of punching the user is extreme, but that's her response. The user's intent was to prevent harm, which is a noble cause. The consequences were severe for the friend, but the user might have done the right thing regardless.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is not in the wrong because they were trying to prevent a dangerous situation. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
