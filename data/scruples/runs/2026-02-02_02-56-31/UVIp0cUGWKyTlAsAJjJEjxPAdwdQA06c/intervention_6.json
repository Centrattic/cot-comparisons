The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. So, the situation is that they were at a party, friend was drinking and smoking, then decided to drive while still impaired. The user tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused, saying Uber was too expensive. Then the user saw her driving while impaired on Snapchat, so they called her mom. The friend ended up getting grounded and her parents took away her phone and car. Now the friend is upset, punched the user, and they're estranged. The user feels conflicted because they wanted to prevent a possible accident but also feel guilty for getting her in trouble.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The user's action was to inform the friend's parents to prevent a potential DUI accident. The friend was underage, driving while impaired, which is dangerous. The user's intention was likely to prevent harm. However, the user didn't confront the friend directly but went to the parents, which might have been a breach of trust. \n\nThe friend's reaction was violent, which is a problem. The user's friends also called them a dick, but they were engaging in risky behavior themselves. The user might be in the right in terms of safety, but the method could be questioned. Did the user have the right to involve her parents without her consent? In some contexts, it might be a responsible action to prevent a dangerous situation. However, maybe there were other steps, like calling the police or a parent, but the user chose to contact the friend's mom, which led to personal consequences.\n\nIn terms of legal age, the user is 17, the friend was 16 at the time. Both under 18. The user might not have legal authority to make that call, but the friend's actions were illegal. The user's intention was to prevent harm, which is commendable. However, the outcome caused personal conflict. The question is whether the user's action was justified. \n\nSome might argue that the user overstepped by involving the parents, leading to the friend's punishment. Others might say it was necessary to prevent a potential tragedy. The user's friends' disapproval might be because they were also involved in similar behavior. The punch from the friend is a clear sign of the conflict caused. \n\nBut the user's main concern is the guilt over both potential consequences: if they didn't act, a crash could happen; if they did, the friend's life was upended. The user feels torn between responsibility and friendship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user tried to help, but the method led to negative consequences. However, the friend's actions were dangerous, and the user's intervention might have prevented a worse outcome. The key is whether the user's action was reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the user acted to prevent a potential accident, even if it caused personal conflict. However, there's a nuance here. The user could have considered other options first, like calling a parent or a responsible adult. But since they did contact the friend's mom, and the friend was clearly in danger, the user's intention was good. The friend's reaction is regrettable, but it's a result of her own actions. So, the user isn't the asshole here.\n"
