  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who called a friend's mom because that friend was driving under the influence. The situation happened at a party that got big, and the friend was doing risky stuff like smoking, drinking, and driving. The user tried to help by offering an Uber but the friend refused. Then the user saw more evidence that the friend was driving dangerously, so they called the mom.\n\nThe friend got grounded and lost her phone and car. Now, the user is being criticized by others for being a \"dick\" and \"asshole,\" and the friend punched them. The user is struggling with guilt\u2014both for not acting if something had happened and for getting her into trouble.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user was in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The friend was under age (16) and driving while consuming alcohol and drugs, which is extremely dangerous. The user had a duty to prevent a potential accident. Even though the user might have overstepped by contacting the mom directly, the intent was to prevent harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's actions led to consequences for the friend, causing a breakdown in their friendship. However, the alternative\u2014if the friend had an accident\u2014could have been far worse. The user's actions were motivated by concern for safety, which is a valid reason. \n\nThe friends and classmates who disapproved were engaging in similar risky behavior, which might indicate a culture where such actions are normalized, but that doesn't justify the friend's dangerous driving. The user's intervention stopped a potential tragedy. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the user could have perhaps involved a parent or authority figure earlier, the immediate action taken was to prevent a dangerous situation. The user isn't the one engaging in the risky behavior; they're trying to stop it. \n\nTherefore, the user's actions were in the interest of safety, even if the consequences were negative for the friend. The answer leans towards the user not being in the wrong because the priority was preventing a possible accident.\n"
