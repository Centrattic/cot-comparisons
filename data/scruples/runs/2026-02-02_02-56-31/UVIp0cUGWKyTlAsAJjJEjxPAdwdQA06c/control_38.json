The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author saw their friend driving under the influence and called their mom to prevent a potential accident. The friend ended up getting grounded, and now the author is feeling guilty and being called an asshole by others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. That's really dangerous. The author tried to intervene by offering an Uber but the friend refused. Then the author called the mom, which led to the friend's punishment. The question is whether the author overstepped or did the right thing.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to prevent a dangerous situation. DUI is a serious issue, and the author might be acting out of concern for their friend's safety and others on the road. The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day could highlight the importance of the issue. The author isn't involved in the party themselves and is trying to stop a potential tragedy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't talk to their friend directly first. They went straight to calling the mom. Maybe there's a breach of trust here. Also, the friend's friends are upset, thinking it's just \"harmless fun,\" so the author is getting backlash. But is that backlash justified? The friend's actions were risky, and the author's action prevented a possible accident.\n\nThe author's intention seems to be protective. They weren't involved in the party themselves and left early. Their friend was under age (16) and driving while impaired. The author's action resulted in the friend's punishment, but it's also a matter of whether that punishment was necessary to prevent a worse outcome.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the main factors are intent and the consequences. The intent was to prevent harm, which is a positive. However, bypassing the friend and going straight to the parent could be seen as overstepping. But in a situation involving potential danger to others, maybe it's justified. The alternative of doing nothing could lead to a crash, which would be worse.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was likely in the right because they prioritized safety. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
