  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend was doing a bunch of risky stuff like chugging vodka, smoking, and then driving. The person thought they were preventing a possible accident. But others, including the friend's friends, are mad at them for getting the friend in trouble with her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The friend was underage (16) and driving after drinking and smoking. That's definitely dangerous. The person in question tried to warn their friend to get an Uber, but when she refused, they took action by calling her mom. The friend ended up with severe consequences, which the person now feels guilty about. But then again, if the friend had an accident, the person might feel worse for not acting.\n\nLegally, underage drinking and DUI are serious issues. The person might have a duty to prevent a potential tragedy. However, calling the parent could be seen as interfering in a personal way. But considering the risks involved, especially with the friend's safety and others on the road, the person's intent was to prevent harm. The friend's reaction (punching them) and others calling them names might indicate that the social circle values partying over safety, but that doesn't necessarily make the person wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the person could have maybe talked to a teacher or school authorities instead of directly calling the parent. But given the immediate danger, the action might have been necessary. The MADD presentation that same day highlights the importance of preventing drunk driving, which aligns with the person's action. \n\nSo, weighing the intent to prevent a possible accident against the consequences of getting the friend into trouble. The person wasn't trying to ruin their life but to prevent a worse outcome. The friend's actions were reckless, and the person acted in what they believed was a responsible way. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
