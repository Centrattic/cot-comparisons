The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend was at a party, was drinking and smoking, and then decided to drive. The user noticed through social media and tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then, the user called her mom to prevent her from driving drunk. The result was the friend got grounded and lost her car, and others are upset with the user. The friend even punched them.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the user acted appropriately. On one hand, the user was trying to prevent a dangerous situation\u2014DUI can lead to accidents, injuries, or deaths. The user might have a moral obligation to intervene when someone's actions could harm others. The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day adds context about awareness of DUI dangers.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't know for sure if the friend was actually intoxicated. They based their judgment on seeing her drinking and smoking in stories. Maybe she wasn't that drunk to drive. Also, involving a parent could be seen as overstepping, even if the intention was good. The friend's reaction was violent, which is a problem, but maybe the user didn't have to call her mom directly. Perhaps a better approach could have been trying to stop her from driving themselves or getting help from someone else.\n\nBut considering the potential consequences of DUI, the user was trying to prevent a possible tragedy. Even if it led to personal conflict, the action was in the interest of safety. So, the user's intention was good. However, maybe there were other ways to handle it without involving the parents. But in a high-school setting, and given the peer pressure, maybe the user felt they had no choice.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions were reckless. She was underaged (16) and driving after drinking and smoking, which is extremely dangerous. The user's intervention, while causing personal issues, might have been necessary. The fact that the parents took action suggests that they agreed it was an important issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while there might be room to debate the method, the user's intent was to prevent harm, which is a valid concern. The friend's reaction is her responsibility, but the user's action was motivated by safety. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
