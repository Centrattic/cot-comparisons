  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: They went to a party where underage drinking and drug use happened. The user isn't a smoker or drinker and left early. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed and started posting stories of drinking and smoking. The user tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused, then later saw her driving while doing all those things. The user called her mom to prevent a possible DUI or accident. The mom thanked them and grounded her daughter. The friend and others were upset, and now they're not friends anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the friend (16) and the fact that she was driving under the influence. In most places, driving under the influence is illegal, especially for minors. Also, underage drinking is against the law. The user's actions were intended to prevent a dangerous situation. They might have felt responsible because they knew the risks involved.\n\nBut then, the user is questioning if they were wrong for getting her in trouble with her parents. However, the friend's actions were illegal and posed a risk not just to herself but to others. The user's intervention could have prevented a potential accident. Even though it caused a rift in their friendship, the user's intention was to prevent harm.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user could have tried other methods first, like calling the police instead of directly contacting the mom. But in some cases, contacting a parent is seen as a legitimate way to prevent immediate danger, especially when the person involved is a minor.\n\nThe fact that there was a MADD presentation at school the same day might emphasize the importance of not driving drunk. The user's action aligns with the message of that presentation. The friend's friends calling the user a dick might be because they don't see the danger, but the user's perspective is about safety.\n\nSo considering all this, the user's actions were aimed at preventing a dangerous situation. They might not be in the wrong because they were trying to stop something bad from happening. Even though it led to conflict, the intent was protective. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
