The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person is 17 and at a party that got really big. They left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The friend was partying heavily\u2014chugging vodka, smoking joints, doing shots. The author texts the friend to call an Uber because they know she drove. The friend ignores the text, says Uber is too expensive, and the author offers to call one. But the friend hangs up, saying she's fine to drive. Then, the author sees on Snapchat that the friend is driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. So, the author calls the friend's mom to report this. The mom thanks them and hangs up. The next day, the friend's parents ground her, take away her phone and car. The friend's friends and classmates call the author a dick for getting her in trouble. The friend punches the author at school. The author feels guilty for both the possible accident and the fallout with their friend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend was underage (16) and driving under the influence, which is illegal and dangerous. The author tried to help by suggesting an Uber when the friend was clearly impaired. When the friend refused, the author saw evidence that she was driving while impaired and took action by contacting her mom. The mom's reaction was to ground her, which the author might not have anticipated. The friend and others are upset because they see the author as a \"snitch,\" but the author's intent was to prevent a potential accident.\n\nLegally, the friend was breaking the law by driving under the influence and under the age. The author, by reporting this, is trying to prevent a possible tragedy. However, the social consequences are that the author is now ostracized. But is that the author's fault?\n\nOn one hand, the author acted to prevent a dangerous situation, which could have led to a car accident. On the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like involving a teacher or a parent earlier instead of going straight to the friend's mom. But the friend's actions were risky, and the author had a valid concern. The friend's friends are upset, but their behavior was also problematic. The author's action led to consequences for the friend, but the friend's behavior was the root issue.\n\nSo, considering the potential danger of drunk driving and the fact that the author tried to help, I think the author is not in the wrong. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author's intent was to prevent harm. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
