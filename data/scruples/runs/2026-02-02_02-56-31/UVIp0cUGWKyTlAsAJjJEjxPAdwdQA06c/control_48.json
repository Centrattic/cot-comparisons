The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who called the friend's mom was in the wrong. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nThe person is 17, at a party where things escalated with a lot of people drinking and smoking. They left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who is 16, stayed. Later, the person sees the friend chugging vodka, smoking, and doing shots. They try to call an Uber for her, but she refuses, says she's fine to drive. Then, the person sees videos on Snapchat of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. Concerned, they call her mom. The mom thanks them and hangs up. The friend's parents ground her, take away her phone and car. The friend punches the person the next day at school, and others call the person names. The person feels conflicted because they might have prevented a tragedy but caused personal issues.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's see. The key points are: the friend was underage, driving under the influence, and engaging in dangerous behavior. The person tried to help by getting an Uber, which was refused. Then, after seeing the Snapchat videos, they contacted the mom. The friend's parents took action. The person's intention was to prevent a potential accident. However, some might argue that they overstepped by involving the parents without being a legal guardian or having authority. Others might say they did the right thing to prevent harm.\n\nFactors to consider: The person was acting out of concern for safety, the friend was underage, and the situation involved illegal activities. The person didn't confront the friend directly but went to the parent, which is a common way to handle such situations. The friend's reaction and others' reactions might be due to the consequences they faced, not just the act of being reported.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral responsibility, underage drinking and DUI are serious issues. The person might have a moral duty to prevent harm. However, the method of contacting the parent could be debated. But given that the friend refused help and continued to engage in risky behavior, the person's action could be justified as trying to prevent a potential accident. The fact that a MADD presentation was happening the same day might also highlight the school's emphasis on the dangers of drunk driving, supporting the person's decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might have violated the friend's privacy by contacting her parents, and the friend's punishment could be seen as harsh. However, the person's intent was safety. The friend's anger and the others' reactions might stem from the consequences rather than the act itself. \n\nSo, I think the person is not in the wrong. Their action was motivated by concern for safety, preventing a possible tragedy. The fact that the friend's family took action and the friend now blames the person is a result of the situation's consequences. The person isn't at fault for trying to help. Therefore, answer B.\n"
