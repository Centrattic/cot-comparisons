  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom about her driving under the influence. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend was at a party, drinking and smoking, then decided to drive. The user tried to get her to call an Uber, but she refused. Then, the user saw videos on Snapchat where she's driving while still drinking and smoking. That's really dangerous. DUI is a serious offense, especially because her parents ended up grounding her and taking away her phone and car.\n\nThe user's action was to call the mom to prevent a potential disaster. If the friend had driven drunk, there could have been a car accident, injuries, or even deaths. The user's intention was to stop something bad from happening. However, the friend ended up being punished by her parents, and she and her friends are upset, leading to the user being called names and even punched.\n\nThe user is conflicted because they feel guilty for getting her in trouble but also think they might have done the right thing by preventing a possible tragedy. The key points here are the safety of everyone involved and the consequences of the user's actions. \n\nOn one hand, the user acted out of concern for their friend's safety and the safety of others. DUI is a legal and ethical issue, and the user took responsibility to prevent harm. On the other hand, the friend's reaction was violent, and their friendship ended. The user might have overstepped by informing the parents without maybe getting the friend's consent, but the alternative is a dangerous situation.\n\nConsidering the potential for serious harm if the friend had driven drunk, the user's action seems justified. They prioritized safety over the friend's immediate desires. However, the aftermath caused personal conflict. But the question is about whether the user was in the wrong. Since the user's action prevented a possible accident, they might not be the asshole. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to prevent a dangerous situation.\n"
