The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation involves a party where underage drinking and drug use happened, and the friend was driving under the influence. The author, who's 17, saw their friend's Snapchat stories showing her driving while smoking and drinking, so they called her mom to report it. The friend got grounded, lost her phone and car, and later punched the author. Now the author is questioning if they were the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The friend was driving under the influence, which is a serious issue, especially with underage drinking. The author tried to intervene by offering an Uber, but the friend refused. Then, after seeing evidence of dangerous behavior, the author contacted her mom. The mom's reaction was to ground her, which the author might feel was harsh, but the alternative was a potential accident or worse.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend and others are upset because the author interfered in what they considered their social life. The friend's friends are calling the author names, and the friend herself attacked them. There's a conflict between the author's concern for safety and the friend's frustration over being reported.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can report someone to a parent or authority if you believe they're in danger, especially if they're minors. The author's action could be seen as a responsible choice to prevent a possible tragedy. However, the method of reporting\u2014without perhaps checking directly with the friend first\u2014might be seen as overstepping, but given the circumstances, it's hard to argue against the urgency.\n\nEmotionally, the friend felt betrayed, which is valid, but the author's intention was to prevent harm. The question is whether the author's action was justified. The key factors are the potential danger of DUI, the underage drinking, and the immediate threat to safety. The author's intervention likely saved the friend from a serious accident or legal trouble. The consequences were strict but appropriate given the severity of the situation.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted to prevent a dangerous situation, even if it caused conflict. The alternative of doing nothing could have led to worse outcomes, making the author's action the right choice despite the fallout.\n"
