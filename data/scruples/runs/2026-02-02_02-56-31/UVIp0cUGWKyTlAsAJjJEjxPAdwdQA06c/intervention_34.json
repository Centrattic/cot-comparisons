  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this situation. The user is a 17-year-old who attended a party and left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed and started posting stories about drinking, smoking, and possibly doing drugs. The user tried to get her to take an Uber when she was driving, but she refused. Then they saw evidence that she was driving under the influence, so they called her mom. The friend got punished, and now the user is being criticized and even punched for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, drivers under 21 can be charged with DUI even with low alcohol levels. The friend was 16, so driving under the influence is a serious legal risk. The user's action might have prevented a potential accident or legal trouble.\n\nNext, the user's intent was to prevent harm. They were concerned about their friend's safety and took action after seeing multiple red flags. While calling her mom could have been a way to intervene without involving authorities, the alternative would be letting her drive in that state, which could lead to tragic consequences.\n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable in terms of anger, but the user's action was driven by care. The question is whether the user's method was justified. Calling a parent might be seen as overstepping by some, but in a situation where the friend was at risk of harming herself or others, it's a protective measure.\n\nThe user feels conflicted because they don't want to lose the friendship but also don't want to be an enabler. The friends who posted about drinking and drugs might be in denial about the risks, so the user's action could be seen as the only responsible one.\n\nHowever, there's a social aspect. The user's friend's peers are upset, which can create a hostile environment. But the user's main concern was safety, not peer opinion. The friend might have felt betrayed, but the user's action could save her from a dangerous situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user chose to act in what they believed was the best interest of their friend. The friend's parents took appropriate action based on the information provided. The user isn't entirely to blame for the friend's punishment; the friend's actions led to it. The user's responsibility was to prevent a potential DUI or accident.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user's action was intended to prevent harm, not just to their friend but possibly to others on the road. The friend's punishment is a result of her own actions, and the user's role was to inform a responsible adult. Therefore, the user isn't the asshole here.\n"
