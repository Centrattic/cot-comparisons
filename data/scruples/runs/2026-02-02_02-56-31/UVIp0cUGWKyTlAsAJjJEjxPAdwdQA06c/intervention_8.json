  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party.\n\nFirst, the friend was at a house party where she was drinking and smoking. The user tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then, they saw her driving while smoking and texting. So, the user decided to contact her mom. The mom said thanks and grounded her daughter. The friend was upset and her friends were angry at the user, calling them names. The friend even punched the user later.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user did the right thing by informing the mom. Let me think about the possible arguments. On one hand, the friend was engaging in dangerous behavior\u2014DUI, which is illegal and could lead to accidents. The user was trying to prevent a potential tragedy. Also, there was a MADD presentation at school the same day, which might have made the user more aware of the risks involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might have overstepped by involving the parents without maybe giving the friend another chance to make the right choice. The friend might have felt betrayed, leading to the punch and the fallout. Also, the user's friends and classmates were doing similar things but weren't confronted, which could make the user a target for being a \"snitch.\"\n\nBut the key points here are the potential danger of the friend's actions. DUI is a serious issue, and the user was trying to prevent harm. Even though the friend was upset, the user's intention was to protect her. The MADD presentation adds context that the school was emphasizing the dangers of drunk driving.\n\nHowever, the user might have considered if there was another way to handle it, like involving a responsible adult or the authorities. But since they called the mom, and the mom took action, maybe that's the best they could do in the moment. The friend's parents were the ones who imposed the consequences, not the user. So the user's actions led to a harsh punishment, but the intention was to prevent a possible accident or death.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the user's actions were based on concern for safety. The friend and her friends were engaging in risky behavior, and the user tried to intervene. The backlash from the friend's circle doesn't necessarily make the user wrong, especially if the friend's actions were dangerous. The friend's punch suggests that she was in the wrong for reacting violently.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user probably isn't the asshole here. They acted to prevent a potential disaster, even though it caused personal conflict. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
