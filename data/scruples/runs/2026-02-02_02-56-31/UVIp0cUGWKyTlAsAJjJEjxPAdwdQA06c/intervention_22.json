  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. They were at a party, saw their friend drinking and smoking, and then driving recklessly. They called the mom to prevent a possible accident. The friend got grounded and others called the user an asshole. The user is conflicted because they feel they did the right thing but are upset about the fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. DUI is a serious offense, especially for minors. In many places, it's illegal for minors to consume alcohol, let alone drive under its influence. The user's friend was 16 and driving, which is a legal issue. By calling the mom, the user might have prevented a potential accident or legal trouble for the friend.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The user saw a friend in a dangerous situation and acted to protect them. Even if the friend resented the intrusion, the user's intention was to prevent harm. However, some might argue that the user overstepped by contacting the parents without the friend's consent. But given the imminent danger, this could be seen as a necessary action.\n\nThe social reaction is another angle. The friend's peers criticized the user, which is common in such situations because they might not see the danger as real or feel that their fun was ruined. However, the user's actions led to the friend facing consequences, which might have caused resentment. But was it the user's fault? The user acted out of concern for safety.\n\nThe user is now feeling guilty because their friend got in trouble with parents and their friendship ended. They're questioning if they were wrong. However, preventing a potential tragedy (like a car crash) is a strong point in their favor. The user might not be in the wrong because they prioritized safety over the friendship, which is a difficult but responsible choice.\n\nSo, weighing all factors: legal duty to prevent harm, moral responsibility, and the potential consequences of not acting. The user likely wasn't in the wrong. The correct answer would be B.\n"
