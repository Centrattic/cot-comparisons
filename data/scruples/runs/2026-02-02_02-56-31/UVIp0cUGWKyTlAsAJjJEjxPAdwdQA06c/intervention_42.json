  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom because they were driving under the influence. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is 17, which is a minor, and their friend was 16 at the time. So both are underage. The party started small but got bigger with underage drinking and drug use. The user left early but later saw their friend's Snapchat stories showing her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. The user tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the user called her mom, leading to consequences for the friend.\n\nNow, the key points here: the user's intention was to prevent a potential DUI/DWI situation, which could have caused a deadly accident. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. The user was acting to protect their friend's safety and others on the road. However, the method involved contacting a parent, which might be seen as overstepping, depending on their relationship and the friend's consent.\n\nBut in many places, there are laws that allow people to report DUI incidents if they see them, especially to prevent harm. Even though the user is a minor, the act of preventing a dangerous situation is generally seen as responsible. The friend's actions were extremely risky, and the user's intervention likely averted a disaster.\n\nHowever, the user might feel conflicted because of the consequences the friend faced, like losing her phone and car. The friend's friends are upset and called the user names, which adds to the emotional toll. The user lost a friend, which is tough, but the friend's reaction (punching them) shows a lack of gratitude or understanding of the severity of the situation.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral considerations, the user was trying to stop a crime and protect lives. The friend's actions were illegal and dangerous. While the method of contacting the parent could be debated, the intent was to help, not harm. The user isn't in the wrong for stepping in to prevent harm. The friend's response and the friends' reactions are more about the consequences they faced rather than the rightness of the action.\n"
