The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence. The situation is that the author's friend was at a party, doing drugs and drinking, then decided to drive. The author called the mom because they were worried about the friend's safety and the dangers of DUI. The friend ended up getting in trouble with her parents, and now the author is feeling guilty and wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was underage (16) and driving after drinking and using drugs, which is illegal and dangerous. The author, being 17, might not be in a position to handle such situations on their own. By calling the mom, they were trying to prevent a potential accident or worse. DUI is a serious offense, and the author's action could have saved lives.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was upset and took a punch, leading to a breakdown in their friendship. The author might feel they overstepped by involving the parents, even though the intention was good. The friends and classmates are calling the author names, thinking it's harmless fun, but the author's action caused real consequences. \n\nLegally, the friend was breaking the law by driving under the influence. The author's intervention might be seen as responsible, especially considering a recent MADD presentation at school about the dangers of drunk driving. The author is in a tough spot, trying to do the right thing but causing personal conflict.\n\nHowever, the method of intervention could be questioned. Instead of calling the mom directly, maybe there are other steps like reporting to school authorities or contacting a trusted adult. But given the immediacy of the situation and the author's concern, calling the parent might have been the quickest way to prevent harm. \n\nThe friend's reaction of punching the author is a separate issue, but it shows the emotional impact of the author's action. The author is left in a morally ambiguous place\u2014trying to prevent a disaster but causing personal consequences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to prevent a dangerous situation. While the outcome affected their friendship, the primary action was aimed at ensuring safety. So, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong (B). But I need to be cautious about legal and ethical responsibilities here. The author did take action to prevent a potential tragedy, which is commendable despite the fallout.\n"
