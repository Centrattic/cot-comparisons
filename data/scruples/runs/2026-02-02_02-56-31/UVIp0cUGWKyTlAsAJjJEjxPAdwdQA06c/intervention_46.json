The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe user is 17, at a party where things got out of hand. They left early, but their friend stayed. The friend was driving and then started drinking and smoking, then the user tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the user saw on social media that she was driving while impaired and called her mom. The mom said thanks and hung up. After that, the friend got grounded, lost her phone and car, and later punched the user. Now the user is questioning if they did the right thing, feeling guilty for getting her in trouble but also worried about what could have happened if they didn't act.\n\nSo, the key points here are: was the friend in danger (DUI is a big issue), did the user have a responsibility to act, and was the reaction of the friend and others justified? \n\nFrom a legal and safety perspective, driving under the influence is extremely dangerous. The user's action prevented a potential accident or worse. The friend was engaging in risky behavior, and the user tried to intervene through Uber first, then escalated to informing the parents. The parents did take action, which probably kept the friend safe. \n\nHowever, the user's method of intervention might be questioned. Instead of calling the mom directly, maybe there were other steps they could have taken, like involving another friend to help, or contacting local authorities. But in the heat of the moment, the user did what they could based on what they saw. \n\nThe friend and others are upset because they consider it \"harmless fun,\" but the user's action had serious consequences. The user might feel conflicted because they wanted to help but caused personal issues for their friend. However, the user's intention was to prevent a dangerous situation. \n\nIn terms of friendship, the punch was an extreme reaction, and the loss of the friendship is sad, but the user's action was in good faith. The parents' reaction was appropriate given the risk involved. \n\nSo, the user is not in the wrong. They acted to prevent a potential tragedy. The friend's anger and the others' reactions are misplaced. The user did the right thing by prioritizing safety.\n"
