The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the friend's mom was in the wrong. So the situation is: the friend was at a party, driving under the influence, smoking, drinking, and doing other risky things. The author called her mom to prevent a possible accident. The friend got grounded, lost her phone and car, and then punched the author. Others are calling the author an asshole. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. The friend was 16 at the time, so even if the author is 17, the DUI is a big deal. The author saw the friend engaging in dangerous behavior and tried to prevent a potential accident. Legally, if the friend had crashed, the author might have been seen as someone who tried to prevent an accident, which is a good motive.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author was trying to protect their friend from harm. Even though they were friends, the author's actions were meant to keep their friend safe. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author took a stand, which can be seen as responsible. However, calling the parents could be seen as overstepping, especially if the friend didn't want that. But given the danger involved, it's a tough call.\n\nThe consequences: The friend got grounded, lost her car, and the author lost a friend and got attacked. The friend's reaction is extreme, but it's because her freedom was taken away. The author might feel guilty for ruining the friend's weekend, but the alternative was a possible DUI accident, which is worse.\n\nOther factors: There was a MADD presentation at school the same day, which emphasizes anti-drunk driving. The author's action aligns with that message. The other classmates who were also doing dangerous things are upset because they weren't caught, but the author's friend was. This shows that the author chose to act while others didn't.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The main point is that the author prevented a potential disaster. Even though the friend was upset and others called the author names, the author's intention was to save lives. The friend's reaction is understandable but not justified. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted to prevent a more serious situation. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
