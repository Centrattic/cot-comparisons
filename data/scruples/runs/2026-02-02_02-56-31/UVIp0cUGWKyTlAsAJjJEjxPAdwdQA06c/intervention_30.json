  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 17 and called their friend's mom because they thought the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time and was seen drinking, smoking, and driving. The person tried to get an Uber for her but she refused, then saw videos of her driving recklessly. They called her mom, which led to the friend being grounded and her car being sold. Now the friend is angry and others are calling them an asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend was underage, driving after drinking/drugs, and engaging in risky behavior. The person tried to intervene to prevent a potential accident. They used their own judgment, even though it caused conflict. The question is whether they were in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, preventing a friend from driving drunk is a responsible action. DUIs can lead to serious accidents. The person acted out of concern for safety. Also, the school had a MADD presentation, which emphasizes the dangers of drunk driving. Their actions align with that message.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they could have handled it differently. Instead of calling the mom, they might have tried to get the friend to a safe place or involved another authority figure. But given the immediacy of the risk, calling the mom might be a reasonable step. The friend was in immediate danger, and the person didn't know other options.\n\nThe backlash from the friend and others might be because they see it as overstepping, but the person's intention was to prevent harm. The friend's reaction (punching them) is a separate issue, but the initial action was to prevent a potential disaster. The person might feel guilt because they caused trouble, but the alternative is a greater risk. \n\nConsidering the potential consequences of not acting versus the consequences of acting, the person's action seems justified. They weren't trying to ruin their friend's life but to save it. So, they're probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
