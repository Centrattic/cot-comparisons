The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 17, and the friend was 16 at the time. The friend was at a party where there was underage drinking, smoking, and drug use. The author saw the friend's Snapchat stories showing her driving while smoking and drinking. After trying to get her to call an Uber, the friend refused and went to McDonald's instead. The author then called her mom, leading to the friend getting grounded and losing her phone and car.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspects: In many places, including the US, underage drinking is illegal. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially when combined with texting and smoking. The MADD presentation at school that same day emphasizes the dangers of drunk driving. The author's actions could be seen as trying to prevent a potential accident or harm, which is a responsible action from a safety perspective.\n\nHowever, the author didn't confront the friend directly or involve authorities, which might have been more standard. Instead, they went straight to the friend's parents. This could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy, especially if the friend didn't want her parents involved. The friend's reaction\u2014punching the author and cutting off contact\u2014suggests that the friend felt betrayed. The author might feel guilty for causing personal conflict, but they were trying to prevent a dangerous situation.\n\nThe opinions of classmates matter too. Some called the author a jerk, but others might see it as doing the right thing. The author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a valid concern. The consequences for the friend were severe, but the alternative could have been a car accident leading to serious injury or death. The author's actions might be justified in terms of public safety, even if they strained a friendship.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: The author reported a potential crime (DUI) to the friend's parents, which could be seen as a responsible action. However, in some contexts, the correct procedure might be to contact law enforcement instead of a parent. But since the author is a minor and the friend is also a minor, contacting the parent might be the most immediate way to address the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's method of contacting the parents might be questioned, the intent to prevent a dangerous situation is commendable. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as their actions aimed to prevent harm, even if it caused personal conflict.\n"
