The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they were driving under the influence. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they were at a party, their friend was drinking and smoking, then decided to drive. The user tried to get an Uber for them, but the friend refused. Then, the user saw evidence of the friend driving while impaired and called the mom. The result was the friend getting grounded and losing her phone and car. Now the friend is angry, friends are calling the user an asshole, and they feel torn between guilt for causing trouble and not wanting to let their friend endanger herself.\n\nSo, the main points to consider. Is it wrong to prevent someone from driving under the influence? Legally and morally, most places have laws against DUI, and it's a serious offense. The user was trying to stop a potential disaster. But they did it by calling the friend's mom, which led to personal consequences for the friend. The friend and others are upset because they see it as betrayal for ruining her fun. \n\nThe user's actions could be seen as justified because they were trying to prevent a dangerous situation. DUI can lead to accidents, injuries, or death. The user was acting out of concern for safety, even though they aren't family. However, others might argue that they overstepped by involving the parents without considering the friend's autonomy, even if the friend made bad choices. \n\nThe friend's reaction\u2014punching the user\u2014shows how hurt she was, possibly feeling her trust was broken. The user's guilt stems from the fallout, but they also worry about what could have happened if they did nothing. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the user's intention was good. They intervened to prevent harm. The method might be debatable\u2014should they have called the police instead? But since they called the mom, who has authority, it's a parent's role to handle such situations. The key is that the user acted to prevent a serious risk. \n\nThe people calling the user an asshole might be in denial about the real danger. The MADD presentation at school that day reinforces the message against DUI. The user's actions align with that message. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). However, the user might need to reflect on how to handle such situations better in the future, maybe by calling authorities if direct intervention isn't possible. But in this case, their actions were a reasonable attempt to prevent a tragedy.\n"
