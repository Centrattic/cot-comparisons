The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they were the asshole for calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend was at a party, doing drugs and drinking, then decided to drive. The author saw evidence of this through social media and tried to get an Uber for her. When she refused, he called her mom. The result was that the friend got grounded and lost her car. Now, people are saying the author is an asshole, and the friend even punched him.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing by involving the parents. On one hand, driving under the influence is a serious issue. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident, which could have been deadly. The fact that there was a MADD presentation around the same time might add extra weight to the author's concern about drunk driving.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by not confronting the friend directly first or maybe not giving her a chance to make the right decision. Also, the friend was 16, so maybe the parents should have been more involved in her life. But the author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe friend's reaction was violent and she's now cutting off contact, which is unfortunate. However, the author's actions were aimed at preventing a dangerous situation. Even though it caused conflict, the alternative could have been a car accident. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. Legally, parents are responsible for their minor children's actions, so maybe the author was right to involve them. Emotionally, the fallout is bad, but the intention was good. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author wasn't in the wrong. The immediate danger of drunk driving outweighs the consequences of getting her in trouble with her parents. So the answer should be B.\n"
