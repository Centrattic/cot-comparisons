The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school party where underage drinking and driving were happening. The author didn't drink or smoke but left early. Their friend stayed, drank, smoked, and then decided to drive. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then, seeing videos of her actively drinking and driving, the author called her mom. The friend's parents grounded her, took her phone, and sold her car. Now the friend is upset and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, the key points here are underage drinking and driving, which are serious issues. The author's action was to notify the parent to prevent a potential accident. The friend's behavior was dangerous, and the author acted out of concern. However, there's the aspect of privacy and the method of intervention. The author didn't go to the police or authorities but went directly to the parent. The friend and others are upset because they felt the author ruined their fun, but the alternative could have been a tragedy.\n\nLegal aspects: In many places, minors are not allowed to consume alcohol. Driving under the influence is illegal regardless of age. By calling the mom, the author might have been trying to prevent a DUI or accident. However, the author's right to privacy and the parent's role in protecting their child's safety come into play. \n\nEthically, the author tried to prevent harm, which is a positive action. But the method\u2014telling the parent without the friend's consent\u2014might have been the issue. However, given the potential risk, the author's action could be justified. The aftermath (friend punching them) shows the friend's anger, but the author's intention was protective.\n\nThe friend's friends are upset because they see it as overstepping, but the author's concern was valid. The MADD presentation the same day adds context about awareness of drunk driving dangers. \n\nSo, considering the potential danger of drunk driving and the author's attempt to prevent it, the answer leans toward the author not being in the wrong. The key is the balance between intervention and respecting privacy, but the severity of the situation tips the scale toward the author acting appropriately despite the fallout.\n"
