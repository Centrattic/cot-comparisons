  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. The friend was underage, at a party with a bunch of people drinking and doing drugs. The person saw the friend's Snapchats and realized she was driving while impaired, so they contacted her mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Driving under the influence is illegal and dangerous, especially when you're underage. The friend was 16 at the time, so she definitely couldn't have been legally driving with alcohol. The person is 17, so they're also underage but maybe more aware of the risks. \n\nThe person's action was to prevent a potential accident or harm. They called the mom after trying to get the friend to use Uber but failed. The mom responded and grounded her daughter. The consequences were severe for the friend, but the person's intention was to stop a dangerous situation. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of privacy and trust in friendships. The person went around the friend and contacted the parent directly. Even though the intent was good, friends might see this as betrayal. The friend reacted violently, punching them, which is a problem on her part. \n\nThe classmates are upset, calling the person a dick, but their concern was about safety. The MADD presentation at school might have highlighted the dangers of DUI, making the person's action more justified in a safety context. \n\nBut was it the right approach? Maybe the person should have tried to intervene in another way first, like getting someone else to help or calling the police. But since they were underage, calling the police might have had different consequences. Contacting the parent might have been the immediate way they thought to stop the danger. \n\nThe friend's punishment was strict, but the person might feel guilty because they hurt their friend's feelings. However, the alternative was a potential drunk driving accident. \n\nSo, weighing the options: the person's action prevented a possible tragedy, which is a positive. But the method of intervention might have been harsh, leading to a broken friendship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the main wrongdoer is the friend driving drunk. The person acted to prevent harm. So maybe the person isn't the asshole here. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But need to consider if there's a better way to handle it without involving parents. However, in an emergency, contacting parents could be justified. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction was violent, which is on her. So the person didn't deserve that. Considering all factors, the person's action was to prevent a dangerous situation, so they are not in the wrong.\n"
