  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who called the friend's mom was in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: A 17-year-old (grade 12) went to a party, left because they don't drink or smoke, and later saw their 16-year-old friend doing a bunch of stuff, including drinking and driving. The friend refused to take an Uber, so the person called her mom to prevent her from driving under the influence. After that, there were consequences for the friend, and the person got criticized by others. The friend then punched them.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the person did the right thing by contacting the mother. Let's consider the positives and negatives.\n\nOn the positive side, the person was trying to prevent a dangerous situation. DUI is a serious offense, and a 16-year-old driving after drinking and smoking could lead to a fatal accident. The person might be saving lives. Also, there's a MADD presentation the same day, which highlights the dangers of drunk driving, so the person's actions align with that.\n\nOn the negative side, the person didn't confront the friend directly but went straight to contacting her mom, which might have been a breach of trust. The friend might have felt betrayed, leading to the punch. Also, the person could have handled it differently, like calling the authorities or another trusted adult, instead of the parent. But the action was done to prevent harm.\n\nLegally, if someone is about to drive under the influence, it's actually a duty to prevent it. The person might not be at fault legally. However, socially, friends might see it as tattling, causing personal conflict. The friend's punishment was strict, leading to the person feeling guilty about the consequences.\n\nThe friend's actions were risky, and the person's intervention might have been necessary. The friends who criticized the person were likely involved in similar risky behaviors, which is hypocritical. The person's action was proactive in a dangerous situation.\n\nBut did the person have the right to call the mom without trying to stop the friend first? Maybe they could have tried to take the keys or call an Uber directly. However, the friend refused to take an Uber. So the person might have felt that contacting a parent was the only option left.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, preventing a potential accident is more important than the fallout with the friend. The person might not be in the wrong because they prioritized safety over friendship. The friend's anger is a result of her own actions, not the person's intervention.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the person's action was likely the right choice to prevent a dangerous situation, even if it caused personal conflict. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
