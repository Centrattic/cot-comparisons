The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom because she was driving under the influence. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe user is 17, in grade 12. There was a party that got out of hand with a lot of underage drinking and drug use. The friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed at the party and the user saw her chugging vodka, smoking, and then later driving while doing all those things. The user tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the user called her mom, leading to the friend getting grounded and losing her car. Now the user is being called out as an asshole by others, and the friend punched them. The user feels conflicted between saving a life and causing trouble for their friend.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the user did the right thing by involving the parents. On one hand, DUID (driving under the influence of drugs) is extremely dangerous. The user's action was intended to prevent a potential accident. On the other hand, the friend might have felt her privacy was invaded, and the user bypassed the friend directly to involve her parents, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nLegal perspective: In many places, it's illegal to drive under the influence, even more so for minors. The user's action could prevent a legal problem for the friend, but even so, the act of calling the parents might be seen as interfering. However, the user's motivation was to prevent harm, which is a strong point in their favor.\n\nSocially, the user is being criticized for \"ruining\" the friend's fun and getting her in trouble. But the people who are upset are the ones who were also involved in the same risky behavior, which might indicate hypocrisy. The fact that there was a MADD presentation at school the same day also emphasizes the importance of not drinking and driving, which the user's action aligns with.\n\nThe friend's reaction\u2014punching the user\u2014shows that she's angry, but her actions (driving while impaired) were the initial wrong. The user's action was a preventive measure, so they might not be the asshole here. The user also tried to help by offering Uber, which shows they weren't just tattling but genuinely concerned.\n\nHowever, maybe the user could have handled it differently, like involving a parent earlier or trying to get another friend to help. But given the urgency and the potential danger, calling the mom was a direct way to stop the DUID. The user's intention was to prevent a possible tragedy, so even if the friend is upset, the user's action was in good faith.\n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014the potential for a serious accident, the user's intent to help, and the context of a MADD presentation\u2014it seems the user is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
