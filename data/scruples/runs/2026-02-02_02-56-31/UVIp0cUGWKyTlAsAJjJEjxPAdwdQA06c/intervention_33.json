The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling someone's mom on them for driving under the influence. They were at a party, saw their friend doing risky things, tried to intervene, but when the friend didn't respond, they contacted the mom. The friend got in trouble, and now people are mad at the user.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the user is 17, not a drinker or smoker. They noticed their friend was doing dangerous stuff, tried to help by suggesting Uber, then when the friend ignored them, called her mom. The friend's parents took action, leading to punishment. The user is now being criticized and even punched by their friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The user's intention was to prevent a possible accident or harm. DUI is a serious issue, especially when the friend was underage and doing multiple risky behaviors. The user might have felt responsible or guilty if something happened. \n\nBut then, the user's actions led to the friend losing phone, car, etc. People around them are upset, calling them names. The friend is upset and even physically attacked the user. \n\nNow, is the user at fault? Well, from a safety perspective, preventing someone from driving under the influence is usually seen as a good thing. But the method involved calling the mom without the friend's consent. There could be privacy concerns here. However, the situation is a matter of safety vs. privacy. \n\nIn many places, there are laws that protect people who report imminent danger, even without consent. The user was trying to stop a potential DUI, which is illegal and dangerous. The friend was underage, so it's not just about DUI but also underage drinking and driving. \n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't try to involve authorities first, like calling the police. Instead, they went to the mom. Whether that was the right approach depends on the situation. The mom might not have been aware of the risk, so the user's action could be seen as responsible. \n\nThe friend's reaction and the backlash from peers might be due to the social consequences, but the user's intent was to prevent harm. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation the same day might highlight the severity of DUI. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user's action was to prevent a dangerous situation. They might not be in the wrong, as their intention was to save a life or prevent an accident. However, the method of contacting the parents could be debated, but in the context of immediate risk, it's understandable. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But need to consider if there's any violation of trust or if there's a better way. But in an emergency situation, acting to prevent harm is generally seen as right.\n"
