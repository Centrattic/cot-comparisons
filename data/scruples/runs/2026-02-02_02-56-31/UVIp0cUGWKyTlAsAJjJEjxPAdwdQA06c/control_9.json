The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, at a party that got big. Their friend, who's 16, stayed and started drinking and smoking. The author tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused. Then, the author saw multiple videos of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. So the author calls her mom to report this. The mom thanks them, and the friend gets grounded. The friend and others call the author an asshole. Now the author feels guilty because the friend is upset and they lost contact.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, DUI is a serious issue. The author tried to prevent a potential accident by informing the parents. The fact that the friend was 16 (underage) adds to the risk. The school had a MADD presentation, which probably emphasized the dangers of drunk driving. The author's actions were to prevent harm, which is a good motive.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of calling her mom directly, they could have tried to stop her friend from driving themselves or involved another authority like a teacher. However, the immediate risk of drunk driving is high, and waiting might have led to a crash. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author was trying to prevent a disaster.\n\nThe friends' reaction (calling the author a dick) suggests they didn't see the severity. The author might feel isolated, but their intention was to protect someone. The fact that the friend got grounded shows the parent took action, which the author intended. The punch from the friend is a consequence of her anger, but the author's action was in good faith.\n\nSo, in terms of right vs wrong, the author's action was to prevent a dangerous situation. Even though it caused conflict, the alternative could have been a tragedy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
