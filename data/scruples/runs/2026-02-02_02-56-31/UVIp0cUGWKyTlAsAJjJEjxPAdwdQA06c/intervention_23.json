  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend was underage, driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. The person did this out of concern for safety, especially since there was a MADD presentation at school the same day. The friend ended up getting grounded and had her phone and car taken away. Now, the friend and others are upset, and the person is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Driving under the influence, especially when underage, is a serious offense. The friend was not only drinking but also smoking and texting while driving, which adds to the danger. The person who called the mom was trying to prevent a potential accident or worse. From a safety standpoint, it's a responsible action. However, they didn't directly witness the DUI but saw it through social media. Is that enough? Maybe, but they had valid concerns based on the videos.\n\nOn the other hand, the person didn't confront the friend directly first. They offered to call an Uber, but when ignored, they went straight to informing the parents. Some might argue that they should have tried to stop the friend themselves first, like calling an Uber for her or getting someone else to do it. But considering the urgency and the risks involved, maybe calling the parents was the next best step.\n\nThe consequences were severe for the friend, leading to punishment from her parents. The friend and others are upset, feeling that it was an overreaction. However, the person's intention was to prevent a dangerous situation. The friend ended up not getting into an accident, so the action might have saved her life. In that case, even if the friend is angry, the person might not be the asshole.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of friendship. The person acted without maybe fully considering the relationship. Maybe a better approach would have been to involve a trusted adult first or try to get help from others. But given the circumstances, the immediate danger of DUI is a strong justification.\n\nSo, weighing the potential harm of letting the friend drive versus the social consequences, the person's action was likely in the right place. The main goal was to prevent a life-threatening situation. Even though it caused a rift in the friendship, the person's intention was protective. Therefore, the answer is probably B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
