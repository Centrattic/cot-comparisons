The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, at a party where underage drinking and drug use happened. They left early but saw their friend, who's 16, posting Snapchat stories showing her driving while drinking and using a phone. The friend had initially said she was fine to drive, but when the author tried to help by offering an Uber, she refused. The author then called the mom, leading to consequences for the friend, including being grounded and losing her car. Now, the friend is angry, some classmates are upset, and the author feels conflicted.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the wrong thing. The key points here are the safety concerns versus the social consequences. The author's action was to prevent a potential DUI or accident, which is a serious issue. Underage drinking and driving is illegal and dangerous. The friend's behavior (driving while smoking, drinking, texting) is very risky. The author's intention was likely to prevent harm, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't inform the friend first, which might have been a better approach. Maybe they could have tried to confront the friend directly instead of going to her mom. However, considering the immediate danger, the author might have felt that time was critical. Also, the friend refused help when approached, so the author's next step was to involve a parent, which is a responsible action in such scenarios.\n\nThe fact that there was a MADD presentation at school the same day adds context about the awareness around drunk driving. The author's action aligns with the messages from such programs. The consequences the friend faced were from her parents, but the author's intention was to prevent a worse outcome. The friend's anger is more about the loss of freedom than the safety aspect, which suggests the author acted in good faith.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by not handling it privately first. But given the immediate risk of drunk driving, which can lead to fatal accidents, the author's intervention was justified. The friend's actions were not just about having fun; they were illegal and life-threatening. So, the author's action was a responsible choice to prevent potential tragedy.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They acted to prevent a dangerous situation, even though it had consequences. The key is that the author's intent was to save lives, which is a higher priority than the friend's social freedom.\n"
