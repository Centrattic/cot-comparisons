The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling someone's mom when their friend was driving under the influence. The friend was at a party, doing drugs and drinking, and the user tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the user called the mom, which led to the friend getting grounded and losing her car. Now the friend is mad and they're not talking anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The user was concerned about their friend's safety. The friend was driving while smoking, drinking, and texting, which is extremely dangerous. DUI is a serious offense, and the user's intention was to prevent a potential accident or worse. The fact that the user saw the friend's Snapchat stories showing her doing all that gives them a reason to act.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't confront the friend directly but went over her head by calling her mom. This might have been a breach of trust, and the friend might feel betrayed. The user might have overstepped by not giving the friend a chance to explain or make a different choice. However, the alternative is risking the friend's life or others' if she crashed.\n\nThe school had a MADD presentation, which emphasizes the dangers of drunk driving. The user's action aligns with those safety messages. The friend's punishment was severe, but it was because of her own actions. The user's friends are calling them a dick, which is more about peer pressure than right or wrong.\n\nThe user feels conflicted because they wanted to help but caused personal consequences. The main question is whether the action was justified. Safety concerns typically outweigh privacy or friendship issues in such cases. So, the answer would likely be B (No, not in the wrong) because the user acted to prevent a dangerous situation.\n"
