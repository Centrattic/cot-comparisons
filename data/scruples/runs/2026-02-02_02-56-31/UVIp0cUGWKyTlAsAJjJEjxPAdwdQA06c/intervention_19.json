  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who called their friend's mom because they saw her driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time, underage, and was doing multiple risky things like drinking, smoking, and driving. The user's actions led to the friend getting grounded and losing her phone and car. Now the friend is upset and even punched the user, and others are calling the user an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user was wrong to involve the friend's parents. Let's consider the factors. The user was concerned about their friend's safety, which is a valid reason. DUID (Driving Under the Influence of Drugs and/or Alcohol) is extremely dangerous, especially for a young driver. The user had reason to believe the friend was in a perilous situation, so trying to intervene might be seen as responsible.\n\nHowever, the user didn't know if the parents would react as they did. The friend was upset about being grounded, which is a consequence of the user's actions, but the user's intention was to prevent a potential accident. The user's friends are blaming them for ruining the fun, but the situation isn't just about fun\u2014it's about safety.\n\nLegal age is a factor too. At 16, the friend was underage, so drinking and driving are illegal. The user, being 17, might not be legally obligated to report, but morally, it's a gray area. The user's action could be seen as a good deed to prevent harm versus overstepping by contacting parents without the friend's consent.\n\nBut in terms of right vs. wrong, the user's primary concern was safety, which is a strong point in their favor. The consequences were harsh, but the alternative could have been a tragic accident. So, the user's intention was to protect their friend, which is commendable. However, the method of intervention led to personal conflict. Still, in terms of being in the wrong, it's more about the outcome versus the intent. The user might not be the asshole for acting out of concern, even if it caused issues. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
