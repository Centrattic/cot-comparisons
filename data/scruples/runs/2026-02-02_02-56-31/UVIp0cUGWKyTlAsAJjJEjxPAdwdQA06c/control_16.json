The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author (17 years old) called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time, and the author saw her doing drugs and drinking on social media, then tried to get her to take an Uber. When she refused, the author called her mom. The friend ended up getting grounded and had her car sold. Now the friend is angry, and the author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the legal drinking age is higher than 16, so underage drinking is illegal. Also, driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense. The friend's actions were illegal and dangerous. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident or harm by informing the parents. \n\nHowever, the author did not directly intervene themselves (like calling an Uber for her or involving law enforcement) but instead went to the parents. There's a question of whether calling the parents was the appropriate action. Some might argue that the author overstepped by not giving the friend a chance to change her mind or by not involving authorities instead. Others might say that since the friend was a minor, contacting a parent was a responsible action to prevent harm.\n\nThe consequences for the friend were severe: losing her phone, car, and social activities. The author feels guilty because they caused her trouble with her parents, even though the intention was to prevent a more serious incident. The friend's reaction (punching the author) indicates anger and betrayal. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author was concerned about safety but also caused personal consequences for the friend. The key factors are: the illegality of the friend's actions, the potential risk of an accident, and the author's intent versus the outcome. \n\nIf the author's primary goal was to prevent harm, they might not be in the wrong. But if they acted out of personal judgment without considering the friend's autonomy, that could be an issue. However, given the friend's actions were illegal and dangerous, the author's intervention could be seen as necessary. \n\nSo, deciding between A and B: A says the author is wrong, B says not. The author's action was to prevent a possible disaster, even if it had negative consequences. Since the friend was engaging in illegal and risky behavior, the author's intent was protective. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here because the author didn't involve the police, which could be expected. But since the parents were contacted, it's a gray area. Considering the severity of DUI, the author's action is likely justified. Hence, B.\n"
