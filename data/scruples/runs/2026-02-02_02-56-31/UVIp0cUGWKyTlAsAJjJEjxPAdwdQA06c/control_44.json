The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a teenager who called a friend's mom because they were driving under the influence after a party.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author, who's 17, was at a party that got big. Their friend stayed and was seen drinking and smoking. The author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then, the author saw the friend driving while drinking and smoking, so they called her mom. The mom responded, grounded the friend, and the friend ended up punching the author.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The main issue is whether the author was right to involve her parents. On one hand, the friend was engaging in dangerous behavior\u2014DUI, smoking while driving, texting. The author's action could prevent a potential accident or death. That seems like a responsible choice, especially given the MADD presentation that same day, which probably emphasized the dangers of impaired driving.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend and others called the author an asshole because they were upset about getting in trouble. The author's action led to the friend losing her phone and car, and their friendship ended. But was the author's intent wrong? The author's intention was to prevent harm. However, maybe they could have handled it differently, like contacting local authorities instead of the parent, but given the age and context, calling a parent might be the immediate thought for a teenager trying to help.\n\nLegally, underage drinking is an issue, but the author's action was to protect someone's life. So, in terms of right and wrong, the author's action was in the interest of safety. The friend's reaction is understandable but doesn't make the author the asshole. The author might have felt guilty about the consequences, but the primary intention was to prevent a potential tragedy. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
