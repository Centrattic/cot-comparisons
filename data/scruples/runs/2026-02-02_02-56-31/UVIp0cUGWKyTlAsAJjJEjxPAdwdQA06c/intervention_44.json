  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong when they called their friend's mom to stop her from driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, the situation: they're 17, at a party where things got out of hand. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The user saw her taking selfies while driving, smoking, drinking, and texting. They tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. So the user called her mom. Their friend ended up grounded and lost her phone and car. Now people are calling the user an asshole, and the friend punched them.\n\nThe user feels conflicted. They're worried they were wrong in getting her in trouble with her parents, but also fear they would feel guilty if something worse happened.\n\nSo, the key points here are about safety vs. privacy and friendship. Was it right to involve the parents? In many places, even if you're a minor, you can report someone if you think they're in danger. DUI is a serious offense, especially for underage drivers. The user's actions could prevent a potential accident, which is a valid concern. However, calling the parents without asking might affect the friend's trust and lead to consequences she wasn't expecting. \n\nBut when it comes to legal and safety issues, many would argue that preventing a DUI is the right choice, even if it causes conflict. The user isn't the one who was driving; they acted out of concern for their friend's safety. The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day adds weight to the idea that this was a preventable situation.\n\nOn the flip side, the user didn't directly confront the friend or try to stop her in person first. They tried to arrange an Uber but she refused. Then they went straight to her mom. That could be seen as overstepping, but given the circumstances, the user might have felt it was the only option left to prevent harm. Also, the friend's actions were extremely risky, and the user had a duty to act if they thought someone else's life was in danger.\n\nThe user's guilt comes from the fallout with their friend and the social backlash. But considering the potential consequences of a DUI accident, the user's actions were likely justified. The friend's parents handled it appropriately, and the user's intent was protective. So, in this case, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), because they prioritized safety over personal conflict.\n"
