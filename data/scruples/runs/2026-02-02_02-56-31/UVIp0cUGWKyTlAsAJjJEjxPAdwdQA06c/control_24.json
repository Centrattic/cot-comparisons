The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's friend was at a party, driving under influence, and the author called her mom to prevent something bad. The friend got grounded and was upset, and the author is now feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The friend was a minor (16 years old in the event, now 17), and driving under the influence is illegal. The author saw her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting, which is extremely dangerous. By California law, even having a blood alcohol level above 0.01% while driving as a minor is a violation. So the author's action was to prevent a potential accident or worse.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author was trying to protect their friend's safety. The friend didn't take their warnings seriously, so the next step was involving the parents. The author didn't directly confront the friend but used a third party (the parents), which might be seen as crossing a line, but given the severity of the situation, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe friends and classmates react negatively, calling the author names. That's a social consequence, but the author's action was to prevent a dangerous situation. The MADD presentation at school the same day adds context about the importance of not drinking and driving.\n\nThe friend's response was violent, punching the author. That shows the friend's anger, but it doesn't negate the original action's validity. The author's guilt stems from the consequences on the friend's life, but the alternative could have been a fatal accident.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author acted to prevent potential harm, which is in line with safety and legal concerns. The parents' reaction was appropriate, and the friend's punishment was a result of her actions. The author's intention was good, even if the method caused personal conflict. So, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
