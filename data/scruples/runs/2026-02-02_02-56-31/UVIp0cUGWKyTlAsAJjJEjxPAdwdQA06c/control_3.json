The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who called their friend's mom is the asshole. So, the situation is that the friend was driving under the influence after a party, and the author called her mom to stop her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. That's really dangerous. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then he saw evidence she was still doing all that risky stuff, so he contacted her mom. The mom took action, leading to the friend being grounded and losing her phone and car. The friend and her friends are upset, even calling the author names, and she punched him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author was trying to prevent a potential disaster by stopping DUI. DUI is a serious offense, and the friend's actions could lead to a car accident, which would be life-threatening. The author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a good motive. Also, the school had a MADD presentation around the same time, which might have reinforced the importance of not driving under the influence.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting her parents without direct permission. However, given the imminent danger, it's a common belief that preventing harm justifies such actions. The friend's actions were reckless, so the author's intervention was necessary. The consequences from the parents were a result of her own actions, not the author's. The friend's anger and the social backlash the author faced don't negate the rightness of preventing a possible tragedy.\n\nSo, considering the potential for serious harm versus the immediate consequence of getting grounded, the author's actions were in the best interest of safety. Therefore, the answer is likely B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
