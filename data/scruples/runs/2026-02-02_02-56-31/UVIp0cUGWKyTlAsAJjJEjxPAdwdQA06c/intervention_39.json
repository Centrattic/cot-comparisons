  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend was underage and was smoking, drinking, and driving. The person thought they were doing the right thing by preventing a potential accident. But now, their actions have led to the friend getting grounded and losing her phone and car. The friend and her friends are upset, and the person is feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The friend was 16 at the time of the event, which means she's a minor. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially when combined with smoking and texting. The person who called the mom was trying to prevent a dangerous situation. In many places, it's illegal to drive under the influence, and it's even more concerning because she was a minor. The person who called the mom might have a legal responsibility to report underage DUI, but maybe not. However, the person is 17, so they might not be in a position to report, but they had the option to call the authorities instead of the mom.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The person was concerned for their friend's safety and the safety of others. They didn't want an accident to happen. But they chose to inform the friend's parents instead of, say, calling the police. The mom thanked them and hung up, and the parents took disciplinary actions. The friend was upset and even violent, punching the person. The person is now feeling torn between guilt for causing trouble for their friend and worrying about what could have happened if they didn't act.\n\nOther classmates were also engaging in similar risky behavior, like underage drinking and drug use. The person might be the only one who took action, which could explain why others are upset. The story mentions a MADD presentation at school, which is about preventing drunk driving. That context might have influenced the person's decision. They might have felt that presentation was a call to action.\n\nNow, the question is whether the person is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The person's intention was to prevent harm, which is a noble cause. However, the method they chose\u2014telling the parents\u2014led to consequences for their friend. But was that the right approach? If they had called the police, maybe it would be different. But considering the situation, maybe calling the parents was the best option they had to stop the dangerous driving immediately.\n\nThe fact that the friend was driving while impaired and engaging in other risky behaviors (texting, smoking) makes it a serious issue. The person who called the mom might not be in the wrong because they were trying to prevent a potential tragedy. The friend's reaction of violence and the classmates' anger might be because they were more upset about the consequences than the actual danger. The person's actions were based on concern for safety, which is a valid reason. So, maybe the answer is B (they are not in the wrong).\n"
