The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author is 17 and was at a party where their friend was driving while under the influence. The friend was 16 at the time, and the author called her mom to prevent her from getting into a car accident or worse. But then the friend got grounded, lost her phone and car, and even punched the author.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, the legal drinking age is 21, so driving under the influence with alcohol is a big deal. The friend was underage, so there's already a problem there. Also, driving while smoking and texting is dangerous regardless of alcohol. So, the author's action was to prevent potential harm or even a fatality. From a safety perspective, that's responsible.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should've handled it differently. Maybe they could have called the police or waited for someone else. However, the author was concerned and acted quickly, which is understandable given the circumstances. The MADD presentation at school (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) probably highlighted the dangers of DUI, so the author was trying to be proactive.\n\nThe friend's reaction is pretty extreme. Punching someone and cutting off communication is not the right way to handle being caught in a mistake. The author didn't cause the accident, but the consequences were severe. However, the alternative of doing nothing could have been far more serious. \n\nThe author also mentioned they aren't a drinker or smoker and left the party early. They were probably trying to look out for their friend's well-being. It's a tough spot because while the action might have saved her life, it led to immediate social repercussions and the end of their friendship. But is the author the asshole? The key here is intent and the potential consequences. The author's intent was to prevent a dangerous situation, even if the result was harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered the best way to approach the situation without involving the parents immediately. But given the risk of DUI, which is a criminal offense with life-threatening possibilities, the author's action seems justified. The friend's friends are also involved in similar risky behaviors, which might mean they didn't take the situation as seriously, but that doesn't negate the danger.\n\nSo, weighing the options: the author tried to do the right thing to prevent harm, even if it caused personal conflict. The friend's response was violent and unforgiving, which is clearly wrong. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because they prioritized safety over social consequences.\n"
