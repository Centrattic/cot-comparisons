The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence. The situation involves a 17-year-old who organized a house party which got out of hand. The friend, who is also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time, stayed and started posting videos of herself drinking and smoking. The author tried to get her to call an Uber, but she refused and said she was fine to drive. Then the author saw videos of her driving while smoking and drinking, so he called her mom. The result was that the friend got grounded and her parents took away her phone and car. Now, she's angry and punched the author, and people are calling the author a dick.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did the right thing. The friend was underage (16), drinking, driving, and using drugs. The author had a valid concern about her safety and the safety of others. DUI is a serious issue, and the friend's actions could have led to a fatal accident. The author's intervention could prevent a tragedy. However, the author didn't go through proper channels, like calling the police, which might be the appropriate action. Instead, he called the mother, which might have been a personal choice but could be seen as overstepping, depending on the relationship. \n\nBut considering the context: the friend was underage, engaging in dangerous behavior, and the party had a lot of minors drinking. The author might feel conflicted because he's a peer, not an authority figure. The parents did take action, so maybe the author's intention was good. However, the friend and others are upset because they view it as the author ruining their fun. The question is whether the author's actions were justified to prevent harm versus overstepping by involving the parents directly.\n\nThe key points here are the potential for harm versus the social backlash. The author's action prevented a possible accident but caused personal problems with the friend. Legally, minors shouldn't be drinking or driving. The author's duty to prevent harm could outweigh the personal conflict. So, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because he tried to prevent a dangerous situation. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it, but given the circumstances, the action was justified.\n"
