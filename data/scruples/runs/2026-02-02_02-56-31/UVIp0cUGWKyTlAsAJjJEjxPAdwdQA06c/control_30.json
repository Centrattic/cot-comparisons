The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when the friend was drinking and driving. The situation involves a 17-year-old at a party where things got out of hand. The friend was underage, driving after drinking, and the author called her mom to prevent a potential disaster. \n\nFirst, the author noticed the friend was doing risky things\u2014drinking, smoking, and driving. They tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then they saw videos on Snapchat of her still doing all these things. The author's action was to contact the mother, which led to the friend being grounded and losing her car.\n\nThe key points here are underage drinking, driving under the influence, and the author trying to prevent a possible accident. The author's intention was to stop her from getting into a dangerous situation. Even though the consequences were harsh (grounded, phone taken), the alternative could have been a car crash with severe consequences.\n\nThe other kids at the party were also involved in similar risky behaviors, which might explain why the author's friend and her friends are upset. They might not want to face similar consequences. The author's action, while causing immediate trouble, was aimed at preventing a much worse scenario. \n\nThe author feels guilty about the outcome, which adds to the complexity. But the main question is whether they were in the wrong. Since the friend was in a dangerous situation and the author acted to prevent harm, it's more about protecting someone's safety. The moral duty here leans towards the author being right, even if unintended consequences happened. \n\nSo, considering the potential for a tragedy being averted, the author's actions seem justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
