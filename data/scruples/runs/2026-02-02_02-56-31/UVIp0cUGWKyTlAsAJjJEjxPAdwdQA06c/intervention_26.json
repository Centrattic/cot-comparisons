The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who called their friend's mom because they thought the friend was driving under the influence. The situation involves underage drinking, drug use, and driving. The user saw the friend on social media doing all these things and tried to get her to call an Uber, but she refused. Then, after seeing her driving while doing all that, the user contacted the mom. The friend ended up grounded and lost her car. Now, people are calling the user an asshole for getting her in trouble, and the friend punched them.\n\nFirst, the user's actions were motivated by concern for safety. DUI is a serious issue, especially with teens. The user tried to intervene multiple times, first by texting, then calling, and when that didn't work, contacting the mom. The friend's actions were dangerous\u2014driving while smoking, drinking, and texting is extremely risky and could lead to a fatal accident. The user likely felt a moral obligation to prevent that.\n\nBut then, the user is questioning if they were in the wrong because they caused their friend to get in trouble. However, the friend's friends are also in situations where they're doing drugs and drinking underage, but the user didn't report them. The user might feel conflicted because they prioritized their friend's safety over her social freedom. \n\nThe friend's reaction was violent, which adds to the user's guilt. The user might be wondering if they overstepped by involving the parents. However, in a situation where someone's life is at risk, contacting a parent could be seen as a responsible action. The user didn't know how the parents would react, but the outcome was a necessary consequence to prevent a potential tragedy.\n\nIt's also important to consider the age and legal implications. The friend was 16, so under the legal drinking age. Parents have a duty to monitor their children's activities, and the user's intervention might have been the catalyst for the parents to take action, which is ultimately in the friend's best interest.\n\nOn the other hand, the user could argue that they should have talked to the friend first or involved authorities instead of parents. But given the circumstances, the user was trying to prevent an immediate danger. The key here is the intent to prevent harm. The user's actions were driven by concern for safety, not malice.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's actions, though they caused personal conflict, were likely justified given the potential risk to the friend's life. The answer is B.\n"
