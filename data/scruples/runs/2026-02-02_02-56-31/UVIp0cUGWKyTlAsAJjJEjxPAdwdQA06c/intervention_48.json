  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom because she was driving under the influence. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the friend was at a party, doing drugs and alcohol, then decided to drive. The user tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then, seeing videos of her driving while impaired, the user told her mom. The friend got grounded, and now people are calling the user an asshole. The user feels conflicted between guilt over not acting and the fallout from acting.\n\nSo, legally and ethically, driving under the influence is a serious issue. If someone is about to drive impaired, it's often considered responsible to intervene. The user's actions prevented a potential accident, which could save lives. However, the method of intervention\u2014calling the mom\u2014might be seen as overstepping by some, but given the severity of DUI, it's a strong action to protect someone's safety.\n\nThe social aspect is tricky. The user's friend and others are upset because they view the actions as ruining their fun. But the user's intent was to prevent harm. The friend punching the user is a separate issue, but it shows the conflict caused. The user's motivation was concern for safety, which is a valid reason. \n\nThe aftereffects, like the friend getting grounded, are consequences the user might not have anticipated, but the primary intent was good. The user might feel guilty about the fallout, but the alternative of inaction could lead to worse outcomes. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, the key is intent versus impact. The user's intent was to prevent harm, which is commendable. The impact caused personal conflict, but the action was in response to a dangerous situation. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the action was taken to prevent a potentially deadly situation, even if it caused personal issues.\n"
