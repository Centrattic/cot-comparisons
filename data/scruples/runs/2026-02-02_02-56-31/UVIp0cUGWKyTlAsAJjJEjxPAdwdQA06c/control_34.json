The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation is about a DUI situation where the friend was driving under the influence after a party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The friend was underage, drinking, driving, and doing other risky things like smoking and texting. The author saw her doing all this through social media and tried to get her to call an Uber. When she refused, he called her mom. The mom responded, and the friend got grounded. The friend then punched the author and they became estranged.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the author tried to prevent a potential accident by informing the parents. DUI, especially with underage drinking and distracted driving, is a serious issue. The author's actions could have saved lives. On the other hand, the friend felt her privacy was invaded, and the author's intervention led to her being grounded and losing privileges. The friend and others called the author names, which is hurtful.\n\nBut considering the safety aspect, the author's action was a preventive measure. The alternative of not acting could have led to a catastrophic accident. The author was trying to protect the friend, not just from legal trouble, but from the physical dangers of drunk driving. The fact that a MADD presentation was happening the same day adds context, showing awareness of drunk driving issues.\n\nThe friend's reaction of punching the author seems excessive. The author didn't cause the situation; they tried to help. The friend's friends also called the author names, which might be because they were the ones engaging in risky behavior and felt the author was a snitch. However, the author's intention was to prevent harm.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend is the one who chose to drink and drive, which is a major offense. The author's action was a response to an immediate danger. While the method of calling the mom might have been direct, the intent was good. The author feels conflicted but is more guilty about potential consequences if he hadn't acted.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's actions were in the best interest of preventing a dangerous situation. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author took a stand to prevent harm. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
