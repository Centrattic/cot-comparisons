The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves underage drinking, possible DUI (since the friend was 16 and driving after drinking), and the author taking action by contacting the mother.\n\nFirst, the friend was driving under the influence, which is a serious safety issue. The author tried to intervene by offering an Uber, but the friend refused. Then the author saw evidence on social media that the friend was engaging in dangerous behavior while driving\u2014smoking, drinking, texting. That's a lot of red flags. \n\nCalling the mom to prevent a potential accident seems like a responsible action. DUI can lead to fatal accidents, not just for the driver but others. The author might have felt that if they didn't act, they could be complicit if something happened. \n\nHowever, the backlash from peers and the friend's family is significant. The friend was grounded, lost her phone and car, and even punched the author. The author is now questioning if they were right to act, especially since the friend's parents are taking harsh measures. \n\nLegally, the friend is underage and driving after drinking is a crime. The author's action could be seen as trying to prevent a crime. But ethically, was it the right approach? Maybe the author could have involved school authorities first or other trusted adults, but in the moment, calling the parent might have been the quickest way to stop the immediate danger. \n\nThe peer pressure and social consequences are evident. The author is being labeled as a \"dick\" for stopping the friend's reckless behavior. It's a tough spot, but the author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe MADD presentation at school adds context\u2014highlighting the dangers of drunk driving. The author might have been influenced by that, reinforcing their decision. \n\nIn the end, even though the social fallout is bad, the action was aimed at preventing a potentially life-threatening situation. The author's guilt stems from the consequences on their friend's life, but the alternative was not calling and possibly facing guilt from an accident. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted to prevent a serious dangerous situation, even if the method led to unintended consequences.\n"
