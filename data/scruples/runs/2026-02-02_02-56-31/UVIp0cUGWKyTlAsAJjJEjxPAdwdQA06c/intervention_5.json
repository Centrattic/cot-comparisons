The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they saw the friend driving under the influence. The situation seems pretty intense. So, the friend was at a party, doing drugs, drinking, and then decided to drive. The user tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the user saw her driving while doing those things and called the mom. The result was the friend got grounded, lost her phone and car, and the user is now being called an asshole by others, even got punched by the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Driving under the influence is illegal and dangerous. The friend was underage (16) and driving while impaired. The user tried to intervene, first by suggesting Uber, and when that failed, contacting a parent. In many jurisdictions, there are laws about preventing someone from driving drunk. For example, in some places, you can be a \"good Samaritan\" and report someone without facing legal consequences, especially if you're trying to prevent a DUI. So legally, the user might be in the right.\n\nEthically, the user's actions were to prevent a potential accident. Even though the friend was upset, the user was trying to protect her life and the lives of others. The friend's actions were reckless, so the user's intervention was a responsible choice. However, the user might feel they overstepped by involving the parents, but given the circumstances of underage drinking and driving, it's a reasonable action to take.\n\nThe social backlash from classmates who also drank is a bit ironic. They might be contributing to a culture that normalizes dangerous behavior. The user is being criticized for acting responsibly, which is a problem in itself. The friend's reaction, punching the user, is clearly wrong and shows the emotional impact of the situation, but it doesn't make the user an asshole.\n\nOn the other hand, the user could have considered other options, like contacting authorities instead of the parent. But given the age of the friend and the potential for a family response, calling the parent was a direct and effective way to prevent her from driving. The user might have felt it was the best option available quickly.\n\nThe user's guilt stems from feeling like they ruined their friend's life. But the alternative was a potential DUI accident, which could have been far worse. The parents' reaction was appropriate given the danger, and the user's action likely saved the friend from serious consequences.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user was acting in a responsible manner to prevent a dangerous situation. The answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
