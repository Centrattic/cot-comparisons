  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling someone's mom because they were driving under the influence. They were at a party, saw their friend doing dangerous stuff, tried to get an Uber, the friend refused, then they saw her driving while smoking and drinking, so they called her mom. The mom took action, grounded her, took her phone and car. Now the friend and others are mad, and the user feels torn between guilt for getting her in trouble and fear of regret if something had happened.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether they did the right thing. In similar situations, safety is a big factor. DUI is a serious issue, and preventing someone from driving drunk can save lives. But the user is 17, so they might be under age, but they were acting out of concern. The friend was driving, which in many places requires a license and is illegal if under 18. The user tried to get an Uber first, but when that failed, contacting a parent might be a reasonable step. However, the consequences were severe, leading to a broken friendship. \n\nBut the user's actions were to prevent a potential disaster. If the friend had crashed, it could have been fatal. So the user's intention was to save lives. However, the method of calling the mom might be seen as overstepping, but given the circumstances, maybe not. The friend's friends are also involved in risky behavior, which adds context. The user might have been the only one trying to prevent a tragedy. \n\nOn the other hand, the user could have considered other options, like calling the police or a parent directly. But given that the friend was under 18 and driving, maybe the user did the best they could. The friend's reaction (punching the user) shows how angry she was, but that doesn't make the user wrong. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standpoint, the user's action likely saved the friend from legal trouble and potential harm. So the answer would lean towards the user not being in the wrong. But the relationship damage is a personal issue. However, the question is about being an asshole, and the user's intent was to prevent harm, so the answer is B.\n"
