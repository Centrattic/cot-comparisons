  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA because I called someone\u2019s mom on them for driving under the influence?\nAbout a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I\u2019m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence. The situation is pretty intense. So, the friend was at a party, doing drugs and alcohol, and then decided to drive. The user tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then, through social media, the user saw her driving while smoking and drinking. They called her mom, who then grounded her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issue here: driving under the influence. That's a serious safety hazard. If the friend had an accident, it could have been fatal. The user's action was to prevent that. On the other hand, they got her in trouble with her parents, leading to some harsh consequences like losing her phone and car. The friend and others are upset, calling the user names and even resorting to violence.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can report someone if you believe they're endangering themselves or others. The user's intent was to prevent a potential disaster. However, the method involved contacting a parent without the friend's consent. Depending on the culture and the parent's approach, this could be seen as overstepping. But the alternative is allowing a dangerous situation to happen.\n\nEmotionally, the user is torn between feeling they did the right thing and the fallout with their friend. The friend's reaction was violent, which shows how upset she was, but her actions were risky. The user's friends also judged them, which adds to the social pressure.\n\nI need to weigh the potential harm of the DUI against the harm of the consequences from the parents. If the user didn't act, the risk of an accident was real. By acting, they prevented that. The parent's punishment, while harsh, was a response to the immediate danger. The user's friends might not see the severity of DUI, especially if they're young and don't grasp the risks.\n\nAnother angle: the user tried to help by offering Uber first. When that failed, they escalated to contacting the parent. That escalation might be seen as necessary given the circumstances. The fact that the friend was 16 (if that's accurate) or 17 and drinking underage adds to the legal issues. The user could be concerned about legal repercussions if an accident happened.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's primary intent was to prevent a dangerous situation. While the method might have led to personal conflict, the action was taken to avoid a potentially life-threatening scenario. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
