The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, at a party, and sees their friend (who's 16) partying, then driving while impaired. The friend refuses an Uber, and the author calls her mom to prevent a potential accident. The friend's parents take action, grounding her and taking away her car. The author faces backlash from classmates and the friend punches them. The author feels conflicted between guilt over causing trouble and relief that they might have prevented a disaster.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted out of concern for safety, witnessed the friend's risky behavior, and took action to prevent a possible DUI/DWI incident. The author's actions were based on seeing the friend drive under the influence, which is a serious safety issue. Even though the friend was upset and others called the author names, the initial intent was to prevent harm.\n\nBut wait, did the author have the right to do this? In many places, the legal age for drinking and driving is an issue. The friend was underage, and driving under the influence is illegal. The author's action could be seen as a responsible choice to report a dangerous situation. However, the method\u2014calling the mother\u2014might be considered a private intervention. The author didn't involve law enforcement, which might be the usual protocol for such situations. But in some cases, calling a parent could be a way to get immediate help without legal consequences for the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped by not discussing it directly with the friend first or involving authorities. But considering the urgency of a potential accident, the author's action might be justified. The friend's behavior was reckless, and the author's intervention led to the parents taking corrective action. The backlash from peers and the friend's reaction could be due to the social stigma around such actions, but the author's intent was to prevent harm.\n\nSo, weighing the consequences: if the author hadn't acted, the friend might have had an accident. By acting, they prevented that but caused personal issues. The author's moral responsibility is on preventing harm, which is a strong point. However, the method of intervention might be debatable. But overall, the author's action was likely in good faith to protect the friend's safety, even if it caused personal fallout.\n"
