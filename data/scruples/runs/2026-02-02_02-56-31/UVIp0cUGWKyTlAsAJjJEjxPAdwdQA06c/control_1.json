The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling someone's mom after they were driving under the influence. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is 17, at a party where their friend was drinking and driving. The friend is 16, which is below the legal driving age in most places, but even if she was 16, driving under the influence is a serious issue. The author tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused. Then, after seeing evidence that she was driving while impaired, the author called her mom. The result was the friend getting grounded and losing her car, and the author being called an asshole and punched.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the author's intent was to prevent a dangerous situation (DUI), which is a serious crime with potential life-threatening consequences. The friend was engaging in risky behavior, and the author took action to stop her, which could have prevented an accident. However, the author's action led to the friend getting in trouble with her parents and the friend being angry.\n\nOn one hand, the author acted in what they believed was a responsible way to prevent harm. On the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parents without first trying to directly intervene, like taking the friend's keys themselves. But considering the circumstances, the author did try to get an Uber first. Also, given that the friend was driving while impaired, the author's action could have saved a life. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation that same day adds context about awareness around DUI.\n\nThe other people at the party who were also engaging in risky behavior (like underage drinking and drug use) didn't face similar consequences, but the author was blamed for being a \"dick.\" However, the primary issue is the friend's decision to drive under the influence, which is a serious offense. The author's action was to prevent a potential tragedy. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend and her friends were the ones engaging in dangerous behavior, and the author took a step to stop it. The friend's anger and the resulting fallout are unfortunate but don't make the author at fault. The answer should be B (No).\n"
