The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user is at a party, sees their friend posting about drinking and smoking, knows she drove, tries to get her to call an Uber, but she refuses. Then, after seeing her driving recklessly, they contact her mom. The mom thanks them and grounds the friend. The friend and her classmates are upset, and the friend punches the user later.\n\nSo, the user is conflicted. They feel like they did the right thing to prevent a potential accident but are now dealing with the fallout of their friend being punished and their friendship breaking down.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. Was the user acting in good faith? They were trying to prevent a dangerous situation, which is a valid concern. DUI is a serious offense, especially when the friend was underage and engaging in multiple risky behaviors (driving while smoking, drinking, texting). The user's actions were meant to protect their friend's safety.\n\nHowever, the method of contacting the parent might be seen as overstepping. While the intent was good, using a parent to intervene might have caused immediate consequences for the friend, leading to anger and the breakdown of the friendship. But the user's responsibility to prevent harm could be a strong point in their favor.\n\nAlso, the friend's age and the context of a MADD presentation at school suggest that there was awareness about the dangers of drunk driving. The user's actions aligned with that message. The friend's reaction and the others calling the user a dick might stem from feeling betrayed, but the user's concern was valid.\n\nOn the other hand, there's no mention of the user knowing about the friend's car being sold or the grounding details. The user didn't know the consequences their call would have, which might make them feel they overreacted. However, given the risk of drunk driving, the action was preventive.\n\nSo, weighing the intent versus the outcome: The user intended to save a life, which is a noble cause. The friend's punishment was a result of the parent's decision, not the user's direct action. The user isn't responsible for the parents' discipline beyond contacting them.\n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
