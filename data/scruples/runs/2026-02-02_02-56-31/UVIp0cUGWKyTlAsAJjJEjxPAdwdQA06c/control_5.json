The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the person is 17 years old, and there was a party that got pretty out of hand with drinking and drugs. Their friend, who is also 16 or 17, was at the party and stayed. The author saw the friend drinking, smoking, and then driving. They tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused and said she was fine to drive. Then, the author saw videos on Snapchat of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. So, the author called the friend's mom to let her know what was happening. The mom thanked them and hung up, and the friend got grounded. The next day, the friend was angry and punched the author. Now the author is feeling guilty because they got their friend in trouble, even though they were trying to stop a dangerous situation.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the friend was driving under the influence, which is extremely dangerous. The author tried to intervene by getting an Uber, but the friend refused. Then, after seeing clear evidence of her driving while impaired, the author contacted the mother. The friend ended up being punished by her parents. Now the author is being called an asshole by others, and the friend is angry.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and moral aspects. Driving under influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident or worse. Even though the friend ended up getting punished, the alternative could have been a car crash, injury, or death. The author's action was to prevent harm. \n\nBut the author didn't directly stop the driving; they informed the parents. Is that the right step? Well, in some cases, calling the police might be more appropriate, but the author might not have thought of that. Also, the author might have been concerned about being seen as a snitch. However, the friend's actions were life-threatening. \n\nThe author's friends are upset and called them a dick, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong. The friends might not realize the severity of DUI. The author's friend's reaction (punching) is also a problem, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nI think the author did the right thing. The priority should be safety over friendship in such a case. The author took action to prevent a potential disaster. Even though it led to social consequences, the alternative is far worse. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But wait, could there be a better way? Maybe, but given the situation, what the author did was justified.\n"
