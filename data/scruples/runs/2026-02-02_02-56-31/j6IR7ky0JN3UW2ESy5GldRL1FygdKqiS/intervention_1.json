  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body and others, and the user finally tells her to stop if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and weight isn't important in their sport. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then dismissing others' positive feedback. The user's response was to tell her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want input. \n\nThe key points here are about setting boundaries. The user isn't attacking Joanne but is trying to prevent the negative self-talk and the cycle of seeking reassurance. The team environment could be affected by such comments, maybe leading to insecurity among others. The user's action might be seen as standing up for themselves and others, not being in the wrong because they're addressing a repeated issue.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a consideration about how it was said. The user might have come off as abrupt, but given the repeated behavior, it's a valid boundary. Also, Joanne's reaction was offended, but that doesn't necessarily mean the user was wrong. So, the answer is probably B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
