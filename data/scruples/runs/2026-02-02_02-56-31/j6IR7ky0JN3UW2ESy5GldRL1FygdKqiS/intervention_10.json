Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the user is on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. They have a teammate, Joanne, who's been making comments about her weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The user finally says, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us,\" and Joanne seems offended.\n\nI need to consider different angles. On one hand, Joanne is clearly struggling with body image, which is a common issue, especially among young athletes. Her behavior suggests she's seeking validation but then invalidates others' input. That could be hurtful and create a negative environment. The user is trying to address this by pointing out that if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nBut is the user's response appropriate? The user isn't attacking Joanne's body; they're addressing the behavior of seeking reassurance and then dismissing it. The user's approach is direct but seems to be encouraging Joanne to take responsibility for the conversation. However, saying \"maybe don't talk about it around us\" might come off as dismissive or unsupportive, especially if Joanne is feeling insecure. It could make her feel isolated instead of supported.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is within their rights to set boundaries. If Joanne's comments are making others uncomfortable or contributing to a toxic environment, the user has a right to speak up. However, the method might not be the most compassionate. A better approach might be to gently encourage Joanne to focus on positive aspects or to redirect the conversation. \n\nAlso, considering the team environment, promoting body positivity is important. The user's comment might be seen as a way to stop the cycle of negative self-talk, but the way it was phrased could be perceived as blaming. The key here is whether the user's intent was to help or to shut down the conversation. The user's intent seems to be the former, but the wording might not have been the best.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user is trying to address a problem, but their method could be improved. However, they aren't necessarily at fault for speaking up. The answer would depend on whether the response was supportive or not. Since the user is advocating for a positive environment, they're probably not in the wrong, but there's room for a more empathetic approach.\n"
