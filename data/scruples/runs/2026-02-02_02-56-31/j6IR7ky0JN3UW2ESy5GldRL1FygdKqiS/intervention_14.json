Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. The teammate, Joanne, keeps making negative comments about her body and then dismisses others' positive feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user tried to support Joanne by saying she looks great, but Joanne keeps bringing up her insecurities and invalidating others' input. The user finally tells Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want opinions. The user is asking if this response was wrong.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, body image issues are common, especially among young women in sports. Joanne's behavior might stem from her own insecurities. The user's initial attempts to reassure Joanne are positive, but Joanne's pattern of behavior is undermining that support. The user's final comment could be seen as a boundary-setting action, which is important in maintaining healthy interactions. However, the response might come off as abrupt or dismissive, potentially making Joanne feel unheard. \n\nConsidering the options, the user's intention was to address the cycle of negative talk. While the method might not be the most empathetic, the user's action isn't inherently wrong. It's about setting a boundary in a social group. However, there's a nuance here. Maybe a more constructive approach would be to address the root cause rather than just the behavior. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. The user didn't attack Joanne's feelings directly; they just pointed out the inconsistency in her actions. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
