  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't an issue, and the teammate, Joanne, keeps making negative comments about her body and then dismissing others' compliments. The user tried to support her, but when Joanne repeated this with others, the user finally said, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" The question is whether the user was in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, the user's teammates are dealing with body image issues, which is common, especially in young adults. Joanne seems to be seeking reassurance but then dismissing it, which can be frustrating. The user tried to be kind initially but set a boundary when the behavior continued. \n\nI need to consider if the user overstepped. They were defending their own teammate's feelings, which is positive. However, telling someone to stop talking about their body might come across as dismissive of their insecurities. But the user's main point was that if Joanne didn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. That's a reasonable boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the user could have handled it more sensitively. Maybe a private conversation instead of a public comment? But the user was part of a group, and Joanne had done this to multiple people. The user's response was about setting a boundary, which is valid if others were also affected.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. They were trying to support their teammates and set a boundary when the behavior became repetitive and unproductive. However, there's a nuance here. The user could have approached it differently, but the intent was to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and the dismissive pattern. So, the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
