  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is part of a college sports team where body image isn't a performance factor. Their teammate Joanne keeps making negative comments about her weight and then dismissing others' compliments. The user finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user's intention seems to be to stop the negative behavior. Joanne was seeking validation but then invalidating others' attempts to help. The user's response was direct but not harsh. They're trying to set a boundary, which is reasonable if someone is being self-deprecating and not respecting others' input.\n\nIn a team setting, it's important to foster a positive environment. If Joanne is struggling with body image, the user's approach might be seen as helping her avoid reinforcing negative self-talk. However, the user might have considered a more compassionate approach, like a private conversation, but their public response was to stop the cycle of negative comments. \n\nConsidering the context, the user isn't in the wrong. They addressed the issue respectfully and set a boundary. Answer B.\n"
