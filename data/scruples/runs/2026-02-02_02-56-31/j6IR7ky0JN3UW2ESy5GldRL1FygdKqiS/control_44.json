Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The team has diverse body types, so there's probably a lot of pressure or insecurity about body image. The author's teammate, Joanne, is constantly complaining about her weight, even after receiving compliments. She does this three times, each time dismissing others' opinions. The author then tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions, which makes Joanne offended.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider intentions and the social dynamics. The author's teammates were engaging in self-deprecating behavior, seeking validation but then rejecting it. The author was trying to stop the negative talk, maybe to protect themselves or others from the toxic cycle. However, the author's approach was direct, telling Joanne to stop talking about it. That might come off as harsh, especially if Joanne wasn't expecting it. But the author had a valid point\u2014if Joanne doesn't want others' opinions, she shouldn't solicit them. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. However, Joanne was doing this multiple times, so the author's patience might have been tested. In a team setting, supporting each other is important, but so is setting boundaries against negative self-talk. The author's response was a way to address the recurring issue. \n\nI think the key here is that Joanne was seeking validation but then rejecting it, which is a common issue with self-esteem. The author tried to put a stop to the cycle, which might be the right approach. However, the method could be questioned. But given that the author was trying to be supportive yet set a boundary, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer might be B (no).\n"
