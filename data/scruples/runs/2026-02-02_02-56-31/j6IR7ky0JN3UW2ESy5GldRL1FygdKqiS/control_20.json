Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is on a college sports team where weight isn't important. They have various body types, which is normal for athletes. One teammate, Joanne, has a body similar to the author's\u2014slim with muscular legs. There's a lot of insecurity among the 18-22-year-old women.\n\nAt practice, Joanne is looking at herself in the mirror, poking her belly, and frowning. She says, \"I'm so fat.\" The author tells her she's not and that she looks great. Joanne responds that it's nice of the author to say but only her own opinion matters. Joanne does this to two more teammates, getting compliments and then dismissing them. After the third time, the author says, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" Joanne gets offended and says, \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, Joanne is repeatedly making negative comments about her body, which is a common issue, especially in young women. The author and others are trying to reassure her, but Joanne dismisses their feedback. This could be a sign that she's seeking validation but is also defensive about her body image. The author, after three instances, tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions. The key point here is whether the author overstepped by telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone repeatedly brings up insecurities and then dismisses the support they receive, it can lead to frustration. The author might feel that Joanne isn't taking their positive feedback seriously and is instead using it as a way to get validation. By saying \"if you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it,\" the author is setting a boundary. This is a way of protecting their own feelings and others' from the negative comments. \n\nHowever, the author might be seen as cutting off Joanne's self-expression. But considering that Joanne is seeking reassurance and then rejecting it, the author's response could be a reasonable boundary. It's also important to note that the team environment is meant to be supportive, and constant negative talk about body image can create a toxic atmosphere. The author is trying to address that by suggesting a change in the conversation.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's comment was confrontational. The phrase used could come off as abrupt, but given the context of repeated behavior, it's a direct way to address the issue. The author isn't attacking Joanne's feelings but is pointing out the inconsistency in seeking feedback yet dismissing it.\n\nIn terms of mental health, body image issues are real and serious. The author might not be in the wrong here because they're advocating for a positive environment. However, there's also the aspect of empathy. Maybe the author should have approached it differently, like talking to Joanne privately, but the action itself is about setting a boundary.\n\nSo weighing all this, the author's intention was to stop the cycle of negative talk and the dismissal of support. The action, while direct, is a way to encourage a more positive team environment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
