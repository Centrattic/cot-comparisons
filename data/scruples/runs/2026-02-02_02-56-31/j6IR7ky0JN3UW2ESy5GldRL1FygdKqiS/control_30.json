Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, the context: The author and Joanne are on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. They have different body types, but Joanne has a similar build. Joanne frequently comments on her own weight, gets compliments from others, and then dismisses their opinions. The author finally tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up.\n\nThe key points here are about body image, self-esteem, and social dynamics. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it, which can be frustrating. The author's response was to set a boundary by saying if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't talk about it. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The team environment is supposed to be supportive. However, Joanne is initiating the conversation, which might be part of the issue. The author is trying to protect the group from negative self-talk and maybe prevent others from feeling insecure too. \n\nBut is it right to tell someone to stop talking about their body? It could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. However, the author is also trying to stop the cycle of seeking and rejecting validation. There's a balance between supporting someone's self-esteem and respecting personal boundaries.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people who are struggling with body image need support, not just correction. The author's approach might come off as abrupt. However, Joanne was doing this to multiple people, so maybe the author was trying to address a recurring issue. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were setting a boundary to prevent unnecessary negativity in the team environment. Joanne was seeking validation in an unhealthy way, and the author's response, while direct, was a way to stop that cycle. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
