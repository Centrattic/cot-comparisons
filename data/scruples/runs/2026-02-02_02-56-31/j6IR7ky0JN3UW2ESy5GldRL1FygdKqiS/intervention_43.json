  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong when they told Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps making negative comments about her own body, asks for compliments, then dismisses them. The user called her out on it, and Joanne was offended.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's intention was to stop the negative body talk and set a boundary. They noticed a pattern where Joanne was seeking reassurance but then invalidating others' positive feedback. By saying, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us,\" the user is trying to address the cycle of insecurity and negativity. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It depends on perspective. On one hand, the user is standing up against body shaming and trying to create a positive environment. On the other, Joanne might feel that her comments were her own issue, and the user's response was abrupt.\n\nBut in a team setting, especially among peers, promoting body positivity is important. The user's action could be seen as constructive, encouraging Joanne to stop focusing on her insecurities. However, the user could have approached it more gently. Maybe a private conversation instead of a public comment. But the user's main point is valid: if someone doesn't want feedback, they shouldn't bring up the topic. \n\nConsidering the background, the user isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a common issue in sports teams where body image can be a problem. The answer should be B.\n"
