  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't important. The teammate, Joanne, keeps making negative comments about her body and then dismissing the group's opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne is seeking validation but then invalidates others' input. The user's response was to tell her not to discuss it if she doesn't want their opinions. The user is wondering if that was wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the user overstepped. On one hand, the user might have felt frustrated by Joanne's repetitive behavior. They're trying to set a boundary. On the other hand, Joanne might feel the user was dismissive or harsh. But the user's statement was straightforward: if you don't want our input, don't bring it up. That's a reasonable boundary, especially in a group setting where people can have different sensitivities.\n\nAlso, considering that weight isn't relevant to their sport, the team environment might be supportive, but individual insecurities can still exist. The user's response is about mutual respect\u2014stopping the cycle where Joanne seeks validation but then ignores it. The user isn't attacking Joanne's body but setting a boundary for future interactions. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The user wasn't in the wrong. They addressed the issue calmly and directly without being cruel. It's about respecting each other's boundaries and stopping the negative behavior.\n"
