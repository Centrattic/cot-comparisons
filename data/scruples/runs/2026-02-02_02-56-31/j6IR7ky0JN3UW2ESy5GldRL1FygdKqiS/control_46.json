Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author's teammate, Joanne, repeatedly comments on her weight and others', seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The sport doesn't care about weight, so there's no health or performance reason for these comments. The teammates have different body types, and there's existing insecurity. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then invalidating others' responses. That's a common pattern in body image issues.\n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary. They're not attacking Joanne's appearance but pointing out that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. It's about respecting boundaries and not engaging in negative self-talk. In a supportive environment like a team, fostering positive body image is important. The author is trying to stop the cycle of insecurity and negative dialogue.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author could have handled it more gently, but the main issue is Joanne's behavior. The author is not bullying; they're standing up for a positive atmosphere. Since Joanne was the one initiating the conversations, the author isn't at fault for setting a boundary. It's about mutual respect and creating a healthier team dynamic.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're addressing a harmful pattern and promoting a positive environment, which is appropriate.\n"
