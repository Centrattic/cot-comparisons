Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't important. The author, who is a teammate, confronts Joanne when she repeatedly comments negatively about her weight, even after getting compliments. The author tells Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport they play doesn't have weight requirements, so body image issues might be common among teammates. Joanne is making negative self-comments, and the author is trying to stop the conversation to prevent reinforcing insecurity. The key points are whether the author's response was appropriate.\n\nJoanne's behavior is seeking validation but then dismissing others' input. The author's response is direct: \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" This seems like a boundary set to stop the cycle of negative self-talk. The question is about whether this boundary is valid or if it's dismissive.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is the author being supportive by redirecting the conversation? Or is the author being insensitive by cutting off a teammate's expression? The author's intention was to stop the negative dialogue, which could be seen as a good thing. However, the method might be abrupt. Maybe the author could have addressed it more gently, but the response was about setting a boundary. Since Joanne was already dismissive of others' opinions, the author's reaction might be justified in maintaining a positive environment. \n\nAlso, considering that this is a team setting, promoting body positivity is important. The author is trying to prevent others from engaging in similar behavior. The response might be seen as constructive in the long run, even if it came off as harsh in the moment. The answer likely hinges on whether setting such a boundary is acceptable. In this case, the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a common issue in a proactive way, even if the delivery could be softened. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
