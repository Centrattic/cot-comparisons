Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. Joanne keeps making comments about her body, and the author finally tells her that if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't talk about it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The author is part of a team where body types vary, and Joanne's behavior is making others uncomfortable. The author tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it by saying only her own opinion matters. Then, after three instances, the author speaks up. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. Body image issues are sensitive, especially among young women. The author's response was direct but not confrontational. They're setting a boundary, which is understandable. Joanne's behavior is seeking validation but then invalidating others' input. The author's comment is a form of addressing the root of the problem: Joanne's need for reassurance that's not being met constructively.\n\nIs the author wrong? They're not attacking Joanne's feelings but pointing out that by bringing it up, they're inviting opinions. It's a reasonable response to prevent unnecessary conversations that make others uncomfortable. The author is taking a stand against negative self-talk in a group setting. So, the answer is likely B (no), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
