  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't important for their sport. The writer's teammate, Joanne, keeps talking about her weight, saying she's fat and then dismissing others' compliments. The writer tells Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, so there's probably a lot of body image issues. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it, which can be hurtful. The writer is trying to stop this cycle by telling Joanne to not bring it up. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, Joanne initiated the conversation each time by criticizing herself. The writer and others were trying to be supportive, but Joanne kept invalidating their input. The writer's response was to set a boundary, which might be necessary to prevent constant negative self-talk. On the other hand, maybe the writer could have handled it differently, like addressing it privately or supporting Joanne in another way. However, the writer's intention seems to be to stop the repeated behavior, which isn't their fault. Joanne started the problem by constantly seeking and then rejecting feedback. The writer's response was a direct way to communicate that they don't want to be part of that cycle anymore. So, I think the writer isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
