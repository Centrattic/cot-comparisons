Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't an issue in their sport. The teammate, Joanne, repeatedly comments on her own weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The user finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne's behavior seems to be a pattern: she comments on her weight, gets a compliment, then invalidates it. The user is responding to repeated behavior, which might be causing discomfort or frustration. In a team setting, constant negative body talk can create a toxic environment. The user's reaction is to set a boundary, which is understandable if they feel that Joanne's comments are seeking validation they don't want to provide or if it's contributing to a negative atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel that others are not being supportive or that she can't express her feelings freely. However, the user isn't saying Joanne can't talk about her feelings; they're just asking her to stop doing so in a way that invites unsolicited comments. The user's approach is direct but perhaps a bit abrupt. They might have handled it more gently by discussing it privately, but the situation involves repeated behavior, so frustration is valid.\n\nThe key points are the impact of Joanne's comments on the team environment and the user's intent to set a boundary. Since weight is irrelevant in their sport, the focus should be on performance, not body image. The user's response aims to address the ongoing issue, which others might find annoying or harmful. Therefore, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for asserting their boundary after multiple instances.\n"
