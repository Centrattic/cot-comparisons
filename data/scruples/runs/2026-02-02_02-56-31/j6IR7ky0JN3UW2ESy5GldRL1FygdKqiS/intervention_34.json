  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her own body and the user tried to compliment her, but Joanne downplays it by saying only her opinion matters. Then the user speaks up, telling her not to bring it up if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weight and body image issues are sensitive topics, especially among young women in sports. The user's team is diverse in body types, so there's a mix of perspectives. Joanne's behavior seems to be a pattern\u2014seeking validation but dismissing others' opinions. The user is frustrated and decided to set a boundary.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they were trying to be supportive at first, giving a compliment. When Joanne continued to dismiss their input and repeated the behavior with others, the user took a stand. The user's main point is that if Joanne doesn't want others' opinions, she shouldn't bring up the topic. That's about setting boundaries, which is a reasonable approach. However, the user's response was direct and maybe a bit confrontational. Joanne's reaction was defensive, which is common in these situations.\n\nBut the user's intention was to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and the cycle of seeking compliments. They're in a position where they feel they can't support Joanne effectively if she's going to dismiss their input. Setting that boundary isn't wrong. The user isn't attacking Joanne; they're asking her to be mindful of the group dynamic. So the answer is probably B, No. The user isn't in the wrong for asserting that boundary, especially given Joanne's repeated behavior.\n"
