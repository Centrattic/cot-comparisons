Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. The team has diverse body types. Joanne, a teammate with a similar body type, often complains about her weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback. Joanne got offended.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author tried to be supportive initially by complimenting Joanne. But Joanne kept doing this with others, and the author felt it was getting repetitive and maybe harmful. The author's response was to set a boundary. \n\nNow, considering body image issues in sports teams, especially women's teams, there can be a lot of pressure. People might engage in self-critical behavior, and others might get tired of constantly reassuring them. But is it wrong to set a boundary?\n\nThe author's action was direct but not harsh. They said, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" That's a way to cut the cycle without being mean. Joanne's reaction was to get offended, but maybe she should have considered why the author felt that way.\n\nOn the other hand, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe. Like, addressing it more privately or using empathy first. But the situation had happened multiple times. The author might have felt it was necessary to stop the behavior to protect themselves from the stress of constant reassurance and to prevent others from feeling pressured.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, setting boundaries is generally healthy. The author isn't being cruel; they're trying to stop a cycle that's causing discomfort. So, the answer is more likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
