Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is part of a college sports team where weight isn't an issue. Their teammate, Joanne, keeps complaining about her weight. The author tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it, saying only her own opinion matters. After Joanne does this to three people, the author tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nThe question is whether the author was right or wrong. So, the key points here are about body image and how to handle a friend's insecurity. The author's intention seems to be to stop the negative self-talk and maybe protect themselves and others from Joanne's insecurity. \n\nBut Joanne's behavior is a common issue with body image. She's seeking validation but then rejecting it, which is a common pattern. The author's response is to set a boundary, which might be necessary if others are uncomfortable. However, in a team setting, it's important to maintain a supportive environment. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for setting that boundary? Well, if Joanne is being self-deprecating and others are trying to support but she's not accepting it, maybe the author's way of handling it is a bit abrupt. Instead of telling her to stop talking about it, maybe a more supportive approach could help address Joanne's insecurities without shutting her down.\n\nBut the author did try to be kind by saying \"No you aren't! You look great.\" and then after repeated instances, they said what they did. Maybe the author's reaction is a result of frustration. However, the author's approach might not be the best way to handle it. It could come across as dismissive or not supportive. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author's intention was to protect their teammates from Joanne's negative self-talk, they might not be in the wrong. But if the method was not the best approach, maybe they should have handled it differently. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether there's a better way. \n\nThe key here is that Joanne was seeking validation but rejecting it, which can be hurtful to others in a team where body diversity is normal. The author's response was a way to set a boundary, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe they could have handled it more sensitively, but the action itself wasn't wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author was trying to address the behavior that was affecting others and setting a boundary is reasonable, especially in an environment where body image shouldn't be an issue. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop the negative self-talk after it's been happening multiple times.\n"
