Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation involves Joanne repeatedly making negative comments about her body and then dismissing others' attempts to compliment her. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't prioritize weight, and there's a variety of body types. Joanne's behavior seems to be about seeking validation but then invalidating others' responses. The author's response was direct but seems to be a reasonable boundary.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting that boundary? Well, Joanne was the one initiating the conversations and then dismissing the feedback. The author isn't shaming her directly but is pointing out that by bringing it up, they expect their opinions to matter. So the author is trying to stop the negative self-talk, which is actually a positive action. The answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were assertive in addressing the behavior that could contribute to a negative environment.\n"
