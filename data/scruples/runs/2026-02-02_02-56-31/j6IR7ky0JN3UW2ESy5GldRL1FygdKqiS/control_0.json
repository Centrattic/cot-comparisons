Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important for their sport. Joanne is similar in body type to the author and others, but seems to have body image issues.\n\nSo, Joanne keeps bringing up her weight, saying she's fat, and then dismissing others' compliments. The author, after this happens a few times, tells Joanne not to talk about it around them if she doesn't want their opinions. The question is whether the author was right to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team environment, the fact that weight isn't relevant here. Joanne's behavior might be causing a negative atmosphere. Body image issues are a big deal, especially among young women. The author is trying to set a boundary, which could be seen as standing up against unnecessary negativity. But is it the author's place to tell someone to stop talking about their own body?\n\nOn one hand, Joanne is voicing her insecurities, but if she's constantly seeking validation and then rejecting it, that could be frustrating for teammates. The author is trying to prevent a cycle of negative self-talk that others are caught in. The author's response might be seen as a way to stop enabling Joanne's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have approached it more gently, or supported Joanne in a different way. But the key here is that the author wasn't attacking Joanne, just setting a boundary. The author's main point is that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. That's a common way to handle situations where someone is fishing for validation and then dismissing it.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to prevent a negative dynamic in the team. The answer should be B.\n"
