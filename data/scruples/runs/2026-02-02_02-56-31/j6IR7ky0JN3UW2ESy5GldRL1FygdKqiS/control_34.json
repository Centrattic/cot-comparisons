Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is part of a college sports team where body image might be a sensitive topic. Joanne keeps making comments about her weight, which the narrator and others try to reassure her about. Each time, Joanne responds by saying others' opinions don't matter. Then, after the third time, the narrator tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up around them. The question is whether the narrator was wrong to say that.\n\nFirst, the context: Joanne is seeking reassurance but then dismissing others' input. This could be a common pattern in group dynamics where someone seeks validation but rejects it when given, leading to frustration among peers. The narrator is trying to set a boundary by saying that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she should avoid the topic. \n\nThe key points to consider are intent and tone. The narrator's intention seems to be to stop the negative self-talk and not engage in a cycle of reassurance-seeking. The statement is a direct but perhaps abrupt way to address the behavior. The response from Joanne was offended, which suggests she felt called out, but the narrator's action is about setting a boundary, not attacking her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the narrator is trying to create a more positive environment by not feeding into the negative self-talk. The statement \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us\" is a form of boundary setting. While the delivery could be softened, the intent is valid. The issue might be that Joanne's behavior is affecting others, and the narrator is trying to address it.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the narrator should have handled it more diplomatically. However, given that Joanne repeated the same pattern multiple times, the narrator's frustration is understandable. The line between being considerate and standing up for one's own comfort is a balance. In this case, the narrator is prioritizing their own and possibly others' comfort by not engaging further.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The narrator is justified in setting boundaries when someone repeatedly seeks reassurance but dismisses the input given.\n"
