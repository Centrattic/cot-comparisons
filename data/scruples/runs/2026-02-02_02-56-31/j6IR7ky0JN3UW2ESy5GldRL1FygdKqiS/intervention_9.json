  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is that Joanne keeps complaining about her body and then dismissing others' compliments. The user felt it was getting annoying and finally told her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The team has a variety of body types, and Joanne's behavior might be contributing to a negative environment, especially since weight isn't important for their sport. The user tried to be supportive by complimenting her, but Joanne's response was dismissive. Then, after three instances, the user set a boundary.\n\nPossible angles: Is the user right to set the boundary? Maybe they're trying to protect their teammates from negative self-talk. But maybe they came off as abrupt? Or was it a valid response to Joanne's pattern?\n\nJoanne's actions could be seen as seeking validation but then invalidating others' input. The user's response was to tell her not to talk about it, which might be a form of standing up for others, but some might see it as cutting off a conversation before it's needed.\n\nFactors to consider: Intentions of the user \u2013 they wanted to stop the negative talk. Joanne's pattern of behavior \u2013 she's seeking reassurance but then rejecting it. Team environment \u2013 promoting body positivity is important. The user's approach was direct but perhaps not the most compassionate. Maybe there's a better way, but maybe the user is justified.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong because they're trying to create a positive environment. However, maybe the tone could have been softer. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since Joanne was the one initiating the negative self-talk and dismissing others, the user's boundary is reasonable. So answer is B.\n"
