Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a college athlete who confronted a teammate, Joanne, for making negative comments about her body. The author says that Joanne was repeatedly complaining about her weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing them. The author told her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Joanne's behavior seems to be a pattern of seeking validation through self-deprecating remarks. The author tried to be supportive each time but eventually set a boundary. The key point here is about respecting personal boundaries and promoting a positive environment.\n\nIn a team setting, especially in sports, body image issues can be common and detrimental. The author's response was to stop enabling the negative self-talk by telling Joanne to avoid discussing it if she doesn't want feedback. This could be seen as a way to prevent encouraging harmful behavior. However, some might argue that the author could have handled it more sensitively, like having a private conversation instead of making a public comment.\n\nBut the author's intention seems to be about setting a boundary to stop the cycle of seeking validation. It's important to note that the author didn't mock Joanne but pointed out the inconsistency in her behavior. Public confrontation might not be the best approach, but the action itself was about stopping the negative behavior, which is a valid concern.\n\nConsidering the team environment and the fact that weight isn't relevant to their sport, promoting body positivity is positive. The author's approach, while maybe abrupt, is aimed at fostering a healthier mindset. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're addressing a harmful pattern and setting a boundary, which is a reasonable response.\n"
