Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a college sports team where a teammate, Joanne, is constantly talking about her weight, making negative comments, and then dismissing others' compliments. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't prioritize weight, so body image issues might not be necessary. The author's teammates are insecure, and Joanne is doing this to multiple people. The author's response is to tell Joanne to not talk about it if she doesn't want their input. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, Joanne is seeking validation but then invalidating others' opinions. The author's response was a direct way to stop the cycle. It's possible the author is standing up for themselves and others by setting a boundary. However, maybe the author could have approached it more gently. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. Since the author was trying to stop the behavior that was affecting others, they might not be wrong. On the flip side, some might argue that it's not their place to tell someone else to stop talking about their body. But considering Joanne's repetitive behavior and the fact that others are also being pulled into this, the author's action makes sense. So the answer is probably B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
