  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. So, first, I need to understand the situation. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. Joanne, a teammate with a similar body type, keeps complaining about her weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing them. The user finally tells her not to bring it up if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nHmm. The user's intention was to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and maybe prevent others from feeling bad too. Joanne seems to be struggling with body image issues. But when the user spoke up, Joanne was offended. So, is the user wrong?\n\nWell, the user tried to address the behavior respectfully, pointing out the pattern. Maybe they were trying to support Joanne by not reinforcing her negative comments. But some might argue that the user could have handled it differently, like approaching her privately first or offering support instead of a direct confrontation. However, Joanne was making others uncomfortable too, so the user might have felt it was their right to set a boundary.\n\nAlso, considering the team environment, promoting positive body image is important. The user's action could be seen as standing against body shaming, especially since weight isn't relevant to their sport. But maybe the user could have been more empathetic in their response to avoid making Joanne feel attacked. Still, the user's message was clear: if she doesn't want feedback, don't bring it up. That's a valid boundary.\n\nSo, weighing it up, the user isn't in the wrong. They addressed a repeated behavior that was affecting others and set a boundary. The answer is B.\n"
