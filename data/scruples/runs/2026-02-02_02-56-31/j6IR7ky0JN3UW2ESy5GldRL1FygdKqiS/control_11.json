Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body and then dismisses the team's opinions. The author finally tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions. The question is whether this is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't focus on weight, so body image issues might be more about personal insecurities rather than performance. Joanne's behavior seems like she's seeking validation but then rejecting it, which could be frustrating for others. The author's response was to set a boundary by saying if she doesn't want their opinions, don't talk about it around them.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, people often have different views on body image and how to handle others' comments. If someone is constantly negative about their body and others are trying to support them but are being dismissed, it's understandable that they might feel like they need to set a boundary. The author isn't attacking Joanne but rather addressing the behavior of repeatedly bringing up the topic and then invalidating the responses.\n\nHowever, there's a balance between respecting someone's feelings and setting boundaries. If the author's approach was confrontational, that could be an issue. But in this case, the author is more direct than aggressive. The key is whether the author's response was appropriate in response to recurring behavior that's making others uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, considering that the teammates are young adults in a team environment, supporting each other is important. The author's action could be seen as promoting a healthier self-image for Joanne by not enabling the negative self-talk, even if it's in a way that seems abrupt.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author had approached it more gently, maybe that would have been better. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's intent was to stop the cycle of negative talk and the dismissal of their support. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
