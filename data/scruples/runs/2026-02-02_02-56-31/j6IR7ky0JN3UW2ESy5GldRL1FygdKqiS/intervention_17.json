  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The teammate, Joanne, keeps making comments about her own weight and looks, then dismisses others' compliments by saying it's only what she thinks matters. The user finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nHmm. So the user's perspective is that they were trying to put an end to the negative self-talk and the cycle of seeking compliments. On the other hand, Joanne might feel that the user was being dismissive or rude. The user is in a situation where their teammate is struggling with body image, which is common in young adults, especially athletes. The user's response was direct, which could be seen as protective or maybe a bit abrupt.\n\nI need to consider if the user overstepped. They were trying to stop the behavior, which is understandable. But maybe a more supportive approach could have been better. However, the user also had the right to set a boundary, especially if they felt uncomfortable. The key issue is whether the user's reaction was appropriate given the context. Since weight isn't a factor in their sport and the team has diverse body types, the user's stance against the insecurity makes sense. The user isn't in the wrong because they were trying to address the behavior that was causing negativity, but it's possible they could have approached it differently. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. So I think the answer is B (No, they aren't in the wrong).\n"
