Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation involves a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The teammates have various body types, and Joanne, who has a similar build to the author, is making negative comments about her own body.\n\nThe author initially tries to reassure Joanne, but Joanne dismisses the compliments by saying only her own opinion matters. This happens three times with different teammates. Finally, the author tells Joanne not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne reacts with an offended look, implying she didn't mean to provoke that response.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the key points are body image issues and how to respond to someone's self-criticism. The author's initial reaction is supportive, but after repeated instances, they set a boundary. The problem here is that Joanne is seeking validation through negative self-talk, which can be harmful. By setting the boundary, the author is trying to stop the cycle of seeking and then dismissing compliments, which might be a healthier approach in the long run.\n\nHowever, the author might have handled it differently. Maybe addressing it more privately or expressing concern without cutting off the conversation abruptly. But the intent here seems to be to stop enabling the negative behavior. The fact that Joanne was doing this to three people suggests it's a pattern, so the author's reaction is a response to a recurring issue.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't being mean; they're trying to enforce a boundary. Joanne's behavior is problematic because she's seeking reassurance but rejecting it. The author's statement is about mutual respect\u2014people shouldn't badmouth themselves in front of others if they don't want feedback. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
