Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. Joanne, a teammate, is similar in build to the author and seems to have body image issues. She's been making negative comments about her weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their input.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't require weight management, so body image shouldn't be a focus for performance. Joanne's behavior seems to be about self-esteem and seeking validation. The author might be trying to protect the group from a toxic environment, preventing others from feeling pressured to comment or from developing similar insecurities.\n\nHowever, the author's response was direct. They told Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Joanne's reaction was offended, which suggests she might have felt criticized. The key points here are intent and impact. The author's intent was to stop the negative self-talk and the cycle of seeking validation. The impact was that Joanne felt offended, but maybe that's because she wasn't ready to stop talking about it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't being cruel; they're trying to address a recurring issue. They're standing up for the group's well-being, considering the teammates' repeated negative comments. The problem is that Joanne was seeking validation, which can create a toxic loop. The author's response, while maybe abrupt, is a way to break that cycle. It's not about being inconsiderate but setting a boundary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author could have handled it more gently, like expressing concern about how Joanne's comments affect others. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the action taken. The action was a clear boundary, which is reasonable in a supportive environment. The sport team should foster positivity, so the author's action supports that. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
