Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They're on a college sports team where weight isn't an issue. The team has diverse body types. Joanne, who is similar in build to the author, is commenting on her own weight negatively. The author and others try to reassure her, but Joanne dismisses their opinions. Then the author tells Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was right or wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the scenario.\n\nFrom what I understand, body image issues are common, especially in young adults. When someone repeatedly comments on their own body in a negative way, it can create a toxic environment. The author is trying to set a boundary by saying that if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. That seems reasonable. The author isn't attacking Joanne but addressing the constant need for validation and the dismissive behavior afterward.\n\nBut maybe some would say the author should have handled it differently, like talking to Joanne privately. However, the situation shows that Joanne is doing this to multiple people, so the author's response in front of others might be a way to stop the pattern. It's also about respecting boundaries. If Joanne is seeking compliments and then dismissing them, others might feel uncomfortable. The author is standing up for themselves and possibly others by setting that boundary.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could have been more empathetic or suggested a private conversation. But given that Joanne was doing this multiple times, the author's reaction seems justified. It's a balance between supporting a friend and maintaining personal boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're addressing a recurring behavior that's causing discomfort and setting a boundary, which is a valid approach.\n"
