  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne, a teammate, is similar in body type and keeps making negative comments about her body, asking for compliments but then dismissing others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is in a group where body image issues are common, especially among young women. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking reassurance but then invalidating others when they try to help. The user's response was to tell Joanne not to talk about it around them, which led to an offended reaction.\n\nThe user's intention was probably to stop the negative talk and maybe protect their own feelings or those of others. But was their approach appropriate? The user might be right in feeling that Joanne's comments are self-deprecating and possibly setting a bad example. However, confronting someone in that way could come off as dismissive. Maybe a better approach would have been to address it more gently or talk to Joanne privately.\n\nBut Joanne was already dismissing others' opinions, so the user might feel justified in setting a boundary. The question is whether the user overstepped or not. The user isn't in the wrong if they were trying to create a positive environment and set boundaries against negative self-talk. However, the way they delivered the message might have been harsh. But given that Joanne was doing this repeatedly, the user's response might be seen as reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, body image issues are sensitive. The user might not consider that Joanne is struggling, but the user also has the right to not be around that negativity. So the answer would lean towards the user not being in the wrong. They were trying to stop the cycle of negative talk, which is valid.\n"
