Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their teammate, Joanne, to stop talking about her weight. The context is that Joanne was repeatedly making negative comments about her body, seeking reassurance which she then dismissed. The user had enough and told her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's intention was to set a boundary. Joanne was engaging in negative self-talk and seeking validation, which can be a sign of low self-esteem. The user might have felt that Joanne was using others for affirmation without valuing their input. \n\nIn group settings, especially in environments like sports teams where body image can be sensitive, constant focus on weight can create a toxic atmosphere. The user's response could be seen as a way to protect the group's morale and stop the cycle of negativity. However, it's possible that the user's approach might come off as abrupt or dismissive, which could hurt Joanne's feelings. \n\nBut the key point here is that the user was respecting Joanne's own stance. Joanne said that only her own opinion matters, so the user's response was a logical follow-up: if you don't want our opinions, don't ask for them. This is a form of boundary-setting, which is generally healthy. It's important to consider whether the user's tone was harsh, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. The user just made a straightforward statement.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel that her vulnerability was met with a cold response. People often seek reassurance even if they say they don't need it, and the user's intervention might have been seen as cutting off a conversation that Joanne was trying to have, even if she was dismissive. But the user wasn't being cruel; they were setting a limit based on Joanne's own words.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user acted to stop a repetitive and potentially harmful behavior. If Joanne wanted to continue the conversation, she could adjust her approach. The user isn't in the wrong for defending the group's boundaries and their own comfort in not being part of that cycle of insecurity.\n"
