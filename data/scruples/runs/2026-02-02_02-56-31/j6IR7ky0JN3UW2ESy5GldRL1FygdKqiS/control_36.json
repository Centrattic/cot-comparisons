Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation involves a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author's teammate, Joanne, frequently comments on her body in a negative way, even after receiving compliments. The author finally tells her to stop soliciting opinions if she's just going to dismiss them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and there's existing insecurity. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it. The author's response is a direct way to put a stop to what's likely triggering others. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are intent and impact. The author's intent was to stop the negative behavior that's affecting the team's environment. Joanne's actions might be harmful, promoting a negative self-image and potentially making others uncomfortable. The author's response is a reasonable boundary to set, especially if others are feeling the same way. \n\nHowever, the author could have approached it differently, maybe by talking to Joanne privately first. But the scenario says the author addressed it after multiple instances. The response is a bit blunt but not malicious. The main question is whether the author overstepped. Since the author was trying to create a healthier environment and Joanne's comments are detrimental, it's more about protecting the team's well-being. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
