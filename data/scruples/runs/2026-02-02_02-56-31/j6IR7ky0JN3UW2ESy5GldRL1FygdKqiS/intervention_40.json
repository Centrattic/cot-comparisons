  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. The user's body type is similar to Joanne's, and they're both dealing with insecurity.\n\nSo, Joanne repeatedly comments on her own weight, gets compliments, but then dismisses them by saying only her opinion matters. The user finally tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want feedback. The question is whether the user was wrong in doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne is engaging in self-deprecating talk, which the user and others are trying to counter with compliments. But Joanne invalidates their efforts by saying it's her own opinion. The user's response is to tell her not to bring it up if she wants to avoid feedback. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, constant negative self-talk can be harmful, and others may feel compelled to respond. However, the user might have felt that Joanne was seeking validation and then dismissing it, which can be frustrating. The user's approach was to set a boundary by telling Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want input. \n\nIs this the user's fault? Well, Joanne initiated the conversation each time. The user's response is a form of setting a boundary, which is reasonable. They're not making Joanne stop talking, but suggesting she avoid the topic if she wants to prevent getting opinions. \n\nHowever, the user could have handled it differently, maybe by addressing Joanne's behavior with empathy or discussing it privately instead of in the group. But the core issue is whether the user was wrong. The user's action was a direct response to Joanne's repeated behavior. \n\nAlso, the environment is a sports team where body image issues might be common. The user's intention was to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and avoid the uncomfortable situation where they give a compliment only to be dismissed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about whether the user acted appropriately. Since Joanne was the one starting the conversations, the user's response is a reasonable boundary. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
