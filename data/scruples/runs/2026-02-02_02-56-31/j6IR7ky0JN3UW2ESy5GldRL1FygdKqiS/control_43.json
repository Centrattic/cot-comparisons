Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a college athlete who told a teammate, Joanne, to stop talking about her weight after Joanne repeatedly complained and dismissed others' compliments.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sport doesn't focus on weight, and there's a variety of body types. Joanne keeps expressing body insecurity, asking for compliments but then dismissing them. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne gets offended.\n\nNow, the key points here. Body image issues are common, especially in sports. But the author is trying to address what they see as a negative behavior. Joanne's actions might be contributing to a toxic environment by constantly seeking validation but then invalidating others' feedback. The author is setting a boundary, which could be seen as supporting a healthy environment. However, the way the author responded might come off as abrupt or dismissive. The phrase \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us\" could be interpreted as shutting down a conversation rather than offering support. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is trying to stop the cycle of negative self-talk that affects others. Maybe they wanted to encourage a more positive team culture. Joanne's reaction might be because she's used to getting pity or reassurance and the author's response disrupts that expectation. \n\nHowever, the author could have approached it differently, maybe by discussing it privately or suggesting a group conversation about body image instead of publicly calling Joanne out. But the question isn't about the best approach, but whether the author was in the wrong. \n\nPublicly confronting someone about their self-talk might not be the best method, but the author's intention was to stop the negative behavior. The team environment is important, and fostering a supportive space is a good goal. If Joanne was repeatedly engaging in behavior that others found uncomfortable, the author has a right to set boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author was trying to create a healthier environment and set boundaries against what could be seen as manipulative or self-deprecating behavior. Even if the approach was a bit direct, the intent was positive.\n"
