Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The teammate, Joanne, keeps commenting on her own weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and weight isn't important for their sport. Joanne is doing this to multiple people, which might be creating a negative environment. The author's response is direct but seems to be trying to stop the cycle of insecurity and negative self-talk among teammates.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, body image issues can affect confidence and team dynamics. The author is trying to address the behavior that's fostering insecurity. However, Joanne's initial comments might stem from her own insecurities, and the author's response could be seen as dismissive of her feelings if not handled sensitively. But on the other hand, the author is setting a boundary, which is important for maintaining a positive environment.\n\nAlso, the fact that Joanne is doing this to three different people suggests a pattern, not just a one-off comment. The author's intervention is to stop the behavior, which is reasonable. The key is whether the author's approach was respectful. The response, while direct, is a valid way to address unwanted behavior without being confrontational.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, promoting body positivity and reducing negative self-talk is encouraged. The author is trying to foster a supportive environment. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're addressing a harmful behavior in a team setting.\n"
