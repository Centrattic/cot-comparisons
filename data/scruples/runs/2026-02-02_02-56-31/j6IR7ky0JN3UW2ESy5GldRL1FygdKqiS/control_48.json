Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The author's teammate, Joanne, keeps talking about her weight negatively, seeking compliments but then dismissing them. The author tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and the sport doesn't prioritize weight. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking reassurance but then invalidating others' input. The author is trying to address the constant negative talk without reinforcing the behavior.\n\nIs the author right to set a boundary? Well, Joanne is repeatedly bringing up her weight, which might create a negative environment. The author's response is direct, pointing out that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't ask for them. This seems like a reasonable boundary. The key is whether the author overstepped or if Joanne's behavior was the issue.\n\nJoanne's actions involve seeking validation but then dismissing others' feedback. This could be a pattern of insecurity, but it's up to the author to address it. The author isn't attacking Joanne's body but is trying to stop the unnecessary discussion. The response was a bit abrupt, but it's a valid reaction to repeated behavior.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have handled it more gently, but the question is about being in the wrong. If Joanne was making others uncomfortable with her comments, the author's intervention is justified. Weight talk can be harmful, especially in environments where it's not necessary. The author isn't criticizing Joanne's body directly but is stopping the conversation that's fostering insecurity.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
