Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is part of a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. They mention a variety of body types, which suggests that there's a range of sizes among the teammates. The issue centers around Joanne, who is similar in build to the author but is struggling with body image.\n\nJoanne starts by criticizing her own weight in front of others, asking for reassurance but then dismissing their opinions. The author intervenes after the third time, telling Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. This leads to Joanne being offended.\n\nSo, the key points here are about body image issues, the social dynamics of a team, and the line between concern and overstepping. The author is trying to address the negative self-talk and the cycle of seeking validation. But Joanne feels hurt by the author's response. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is trying to protect their own feelings and possibly those of the teammates by setting a boundary. However, they might be perceived as cutting off Joanne's self-expression. On the other hand, Joanne's behavior is seeking constant validation, which could be seen as manipulative. The author's response is direct but not overly harsh. \n\nIn many cases, setting boundaries around sensitive topics is acceptable, especially if others are uncomfortable. Since the author's team has a range of body types and weight isn't relevant to their sport, there's a strong case that the author is justified in asking Joanne to stop. \n\nJoanne's reaction might stem from her own insecurities, but the author's intention is to stop the cycle of negative self-talk. The team environment should support each other, and the author's action is a way to foster a positive atmosphere. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
