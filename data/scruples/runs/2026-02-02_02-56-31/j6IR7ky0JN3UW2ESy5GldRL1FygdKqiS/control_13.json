Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. The team has diverse body types, so Joanne's body image issues might not be directly related to their sport. The user says they tried to compliment Joanne, but she kept dismissing their opinions. Then, after she did this to others, the user told her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne seemed offended.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user's response was appropriate. The user was trying to address Joanne's behavior of seeking compliments and then invalidating them. The user's approach was to set a boundary by saying if she doesn't want their opinions, then avoid the topic. \n\nPossible angles: Was the user being dismissive or supportive? Joanne's behavior might be a sign of insecurity, and the user's response could be seen as cutting off a conversation that Joanne might need support with. However, the user might feel that Joanne is undermining their attempts to be kind by not accepting the compliments. \n\nAnother point: The user wasn't attacking Joanne's body directly but was trying to set a boundary against the pattern of behavior. In a team setting, creating a supportive environment is important. If Joanne is repeatedly bringing up her weight and dismissing others' input, it could create a negative atmosphere. The user's intervention might be intended to stop that cycle, which could be seen as right. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user could have approached it with more empathy, like discussing Joanne's feelings instead of setting a boundary. But the user's action was direct and might have been necessary if Joanne's behavior was becoming a consistent issue. \n\nConsidering the options: The user's intent was to stop the unnecessary conversation that was causing discomfort. Since Joanne was already getting the compliments and dismissing them each time, the user's response was a way to communicate that if she doesn't want their input, she shouldn't ask. It's a form of setting a boundary, which is usually a healthy thing. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
