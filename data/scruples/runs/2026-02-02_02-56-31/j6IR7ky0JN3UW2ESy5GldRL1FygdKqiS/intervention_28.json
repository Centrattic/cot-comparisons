  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did something wrong by telling a teammate to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The teammate, Joanne, keeps commenting on her own weight in a negative way, and the user tells her that if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't bring it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user was trying to be supportive by complimenting Joanne, but then when Joanne dismissed their opinions, the user responded by saying to stop talking about it if she doesn't want feedback. The key here is whether the user overstepped or not.\n\nJoanne was making negative self-comments, which could be a sign of insecurity. The user's response might have been an attempt to stop the negative self-talk. However, Joanne's reaction was offended, so maybe the user was too direct. But the user's point was valid: if Joanne doesn't want their input, she shouldn't bring it up. That's a common communication issue. Sometimes people seek validation but then dismiss others' attempts to help. \n\nThe user's approach was to set a boundary, which is reasonable. It's important to communicate that you can't control others' self-talk, but you can express that it's not helpful when they dismiss others' support. The user didn't attack Joanne directly but pointed out the inconsistency. \n\nIn terms of being wrong, the user might be in the right because they were trying to address the issue constructively. However, maybe a softer approach could have been better, but the user's intent was to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and unwanted comments. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the user is not in the wrong) because they were standing up for themselves and trying to improve the environment by setting boundaries.\n"
