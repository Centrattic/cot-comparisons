Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a college sports team where the author told a teammate, Joanne, to stop talking about her weight after Joanne kept complaining and then dismissing others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sport doesn't prioritize weight, so there's a mix of body types. Joanne repeatedly brings up her weight, gets compliments, but then invalidates them by saying it's only her opinion that matters. The author confronts her after the third time, saying if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne is offended.\n\nThe key points here are about body image, the dynamics of giving and receiving compliments, and setting boundaries. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking reassurance but then dismissing others' input. The author is trying to set a boundary because they're tired of the back-and-forth. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author was trying to address the issue after repeated instances. They weren't attacking Joanne but pointing out the inconsistency. Joanne's response was defensive, but the author had a right to express their discomfort with the situation. The team environment might need open discussions about body image, but the author's action was a direct response to being dismissed multiple times. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have approached it more gently, like discussing it privately or with a coach. But given the context, the author's intent was to stop the cycle of seeking and then dismissing feedback. So probably, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
