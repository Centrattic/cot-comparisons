Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body and others, then dismisses their compliments. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. The author's intention is to stop the negative body talk, which is understandable. They're part of a sports team where body types vary, so maybe they want to support each other. Joanne's behavior is causing insecurity, and the author is trying to address it by setting a boundary.\n\nBut is it the author's place to do that? Joanne might feel that her comments are her own business. However, when she asks for a compliment and then invalidates it, it's manipulative. The author's response is a direct consequence. The author isn't attacking Joanne but pointing out that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't solicit it. \n\nAlso, considering the team environment, promoting a positive atmosphere is important. The author is trying to prevent others from feeling pressured to offer compliments or deal with Joanne's negativity. So, the author's action is about setting a boundary for the group's well-being, not just personal.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the author should have addressed it more privately or with a team leader. But the situation shows Joanne repeated the behavior with others, so the author felt justified in speaking up. The response was direct, but not aggressive. The key is whether the author's intent was to help and the method was appropriate.\n\nIn the end, the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up against toxic behavior that affects the team's morale. It's about creating a supportive environment. So answer B.\n"
