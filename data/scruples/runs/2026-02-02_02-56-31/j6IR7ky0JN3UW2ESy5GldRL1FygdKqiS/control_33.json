Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne, a teammate, keeps complaining about her body and then dismissing the compliments given by others. The author finally tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and weight isn't important in their sport. Joanne is similar in build to the author. The problem here is that Joanne is making negative comments about her body and then invalidating others' positive feedback. The author's response was a direct way to set a boundary.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics. Joanne is creating a negative environment by focusing on her body and then not accepting the support others offer. The author, by speaking up, is trying to address the behavior that's affecting the team's atmosphere. The author's message is about respecting each other's boundaries\u2014since Joanne doesn't want to hear their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring up the topic. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is standing up for themselves and possibly others who are tired of Joanne's behavior. It's about setting a boundary, which is a valid action. However, maybe the author could have approached it differently, but the intent was to stop the negative behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne's actions involve seeking validation but then dismissing it, which can be hurtful. The author's response is a way to stop the cycle. So, in this case, the author isn't wrong. They're addressing an issue that affects the team's well-being. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
