Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The background is that the teammate, Joanne, was making negative comments about her body and then dismissing others' compliments. The user called her out after she did it multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a sports team where body types vary, and weight isn't a factor in their sport. Joanne was being insecure and seeking validation but then invalidating others' input. The user's response was to say that if Joanne didn't want opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. The question is whether the user was wrong for that.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, body image issues are common, and constant negative self-talk can be harmful. The user was trying to set a boundary to stop the negative behavior. However, the way they approached it might have come off as abrupt or dismissive, especially since Joanne was defensive. But the user's intention was to address the repeated behavior, which could be seen as supporting a healthier environment.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user could have handled it more gently, like having a private conversation with Joanne to express concern. But given that Joanne was seeking validation and then shutting others out, the user might have felt frustrated and needed to set a boundary.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were trying to create a supportive environment by addressing the constant negative talk. The answer is likely B (No), but I need to make sure there's no cultural or other factors I'm missing. Since the user's approach was direct but in a team setting where such talk might be common, it's reasonable. So final answer is B.\n"
