Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop discussing her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. Joanne, who has a similar body type, often complains about her weight, gets compliments, and then dismisses them by saying only her opinion matters. The author finally tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it, which can be hurtful. The author is trying to set a boundary, which is understandable if Joanne's comments are creating a negative environment. The team has diverse body types, so body image issues might be common. The author's response is direct but not hostile, just a request to stop the conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel defensive if she's used to getting supportive responses. The author's approach could be seen as dismissive if not done with care. However, the key point is that the author is advocating for their own comfort, not attacking Joanne. The question is about whether the author was wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nConsidering that body image issues can lead to disordered eating and negative self-esteem, especially in athletes, the author's intervention might be a positive step to prevent harmful behavior. The author isn't judging Joanne but asking her to respect others' boundaries. Since Joanne was the one initiating the topic and then dismissing feedback, the author's response seems justified.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were setting a boundary to stop unproductive dialogue and protect their own mental health, especially in an environment where such discussions can be harmful.\n"
