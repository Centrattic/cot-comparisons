  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is that Joanne repeatedly comments on being fat, gets compliments, then dismisses them by saying others' opinions don't matter. The user finally tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is part of a college sports team where weight isn't an issue, and body types vary. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then invalidating it. The user's response is direct, but is it wrong?\n\nBody image issues are sensitive. The user might have felt that Joanne's comments were negative and they were trying to be supportive by giving compliments, but Joanne kept undermining that. The user's final comment is about boundaries\u2014saying if Joanne doesn't want opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. That makes sense because you can't control what others say, but you can control your reactions and set boundaries.\n\nHowever, maybe the user could have handled it differently. Instead of cutting off the conversation, maybe they could have had a private conversation with Joanne to express concern. But the user might feel frustrated after multiple instances. The question is whether their reaction is justified.\n\nThe user isn't attacking Joanne's weight; they're setting a boundary. They aren't in the wrong for saying that if she doesn't want feedback, maybe she shouldn't comment on it. It's about mutual respect. The user's response is about stopping the cycle of seeking validation and then dismissing it. So the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
