Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne was making negative comments about her own body, getting validation from others, and then dismissing their responses. The author decided to tell her that if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't bring it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport team includes people of various body types, and weight isn't a factor in their performance. Joanne's behavior seems to be about seeking reassurance but then dismissing it, which can be hurtful and create a negative environment. The author's response was a direct way to stop the cycle. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, they were trying to address the issue after multiple instances. They didn't confront her in an aggressive way but pointed out the inconsistency. It seems like a reasonable response to prevent others from feeling pressured to respond. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way? Like, maybe having a private conversation instead of a public one? But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's intention was to put an end to the negative self-talk that was affecting the team dynamic. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
