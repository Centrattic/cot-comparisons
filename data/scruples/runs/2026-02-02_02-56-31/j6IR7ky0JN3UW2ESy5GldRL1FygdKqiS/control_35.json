Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The author's teammate, Joanne, repeatedly comments on her weight in a negative way, seeking compliments but then dismissing them. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne is engaging in negative self-talk, which can be harmful, especially in a group setting. The author is trying to stop the cycle where Joanne seeks validation but then invalidates it. The author's response is direct but seems to be an attempt to address the issue without enabling the negative behavior. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to think about intent and impact. The author's intent was to stop the pattern of self-criticism and the cycle of seeking and rejecting compliments. The impact could be that Joanne felt criticized, but the author's approach might be a way to encourage self-acceptance. \n\nHowever, the author could have approached it differently. Maybe a more supportive way, like discussing body image concerns in a private setting or suggesting a different topic. But the author's action was a direct response to repeated behavior, which might be justified given the team environment and the fact that weight isn't important in their sport.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to stop talking about their weight could come off as dismissive. It might not address the underlying insecurities Joanne has. But considering that Joanne was already dismissing others' opinions, the author might be trying to set boundaries.\n\nI think the key points are: Joanne was seeking validation but rejecting it, the author tried to address the issue by setting a boundary, and the team environment isn't focused on weight. The author's response, while direct, was in response to repeated behavior. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were trying to create a positive environment and stop harmful self-talk.\n"
