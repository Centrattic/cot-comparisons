Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The context is that Joanne keeps complaining about being fat and then dismissing their compliments, leading the user to respond by saying if she doesn't want their opinions, not to talk about it around them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The team has a variety of body types, and weight isn't a factor in their sport. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then invalidating others' positive feedback. The user is frustrated enough to set a boundary by telling Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their input.\n\nPossible perspectives: The user might be justified in setting boundaries against negative self-talk that creates an uncomfortable environment. However, maybe they could have approached it more gently or with support instead of a direct confrontation. \n\nBut Joanne's behavior is repetitive and dismissive. The user's response was a clear boundary after multiple instances. It's important to prevent a culture of body-shaming or insecurity. The user's comment was a polite but firm way to address the issue, especially in a group setting where others might feel the same. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for a positive environment and respecting others' discomfort with the topic. The key is that Joanne was the one initiating the negative discussion each time, so the user's response is reasonable.\n"
