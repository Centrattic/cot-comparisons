  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't an issue. Joanne keeps saying she's fat and then dismissing others' compliments.\n\nSo, the user was polite at first, saying Joanne looks good. But then Joanne kept doing this to others too. The user then told her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The user is wondering if they overstepped.\n\nHmm. On one hand, Joanne is making negative comments about herself and maybe creating a negative environment. The user tried to be supportive but then set a boundary. It's important to protect others from body-shaming, even if it's self-deprecating. But on the other hand, maybe the user could have handled it differently, like talking to Joanne privately first instead of cutting her off in front of others?\n\nBut the user's intention was to stop the cycle of seeking compliments and then dismissing them. It's a common issue with body image, especially in teams where people feel insecure. By setting a boundary, the user might have been trying to address the underlying issue. However, the way they said it might have come off as abrupt. Joanne's reaction shows she felt offended. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user isn't in the wrong because they were standing up against unnecessary negativity. The team doesn't need to focus on weight, so the user's response makes sense. It's a balance between supporting a teammate and maintaining a positive environment. I think the user's action was justified. They tried to be kind first, then set a boundary when the behavior continued. So answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
