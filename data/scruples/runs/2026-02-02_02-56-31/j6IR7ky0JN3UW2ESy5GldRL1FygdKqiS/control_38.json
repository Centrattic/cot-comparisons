Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, the context: They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. The teammates have different body types, and one, Joanne, is struggling with body image. She's making negative comments about her weight, getting validation from others, but then dismissing their compliments. The author finally tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was right or wrong to confront Joanne. The key points here are about body image, the impact of negative self-talk, and peer interactions. \n\nJoanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it. This can create a cycle where she's not getting the support she might need. The author's response is to set a boundary, telling Joanne to stop initiating the conversation if she doesn't want the opinions. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, constant body criticism can lead to issues like eating disorders or low self-esteem. Friends or teammates might be trying to help by offering positive feedback, but if Joanne is pushing it away, that's a problem. The author's response is a way to stop the cycle and encourage a healthier mindset. \n\nHowever, one could argue that the author could have handled it more gently, maybe by discussing it privately or offering support without confrontation. But the scenario shows that Joanne was repeated in her behavior despite others' attempts to reassure her. \n\nIn team settings, especially in sports, maintaining a positive environment is important. The author is trying to protect the group dynamic by not allowing toxic self-talk to continue. It's a form of standing up for oneself and others, promoting a supportive atmosphere.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's action seems justified. They're not in the wrong for setting a boundary when someone is consistently seeking negative reinforcement. Answer B (No) makes sense here.\n"
