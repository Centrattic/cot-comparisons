  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is part of a college sports team where body types vary. Their teammate, Joanne, frequently comments on her weight in a negative way, like poking her belly and saying she's fat. The user tries to reassure her each time, but Joanne dismisses their compliments, saying only her own opinion matters. After this happens three times, the user tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up around them. Joanne reacts with an offended look and says she was just commenting.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's consider the context. Joanne is engaging in self-deprecating remarks, which can create a negative environment. The user is trying to be supportive but feels that Joanne is using their compliments insincerely. By telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want feedback, the user is setting a boundary. \n\nIs the user being inconsiderate? Well, Joanne's behavior might stem from insecurity, which is common, especially in athletic women. However, repeatedly bringing up body image issues can be harmful, even unintentionally. The user's response is a direct way of addressing the issue, which could be seen as standing up for themselves and others who might also feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, Joanne might feel that the user is dismissing her feelings or being too direct.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the user's action seems justified. They're not attacking Joanne but pointing out that if Joanne doesn't want input, she shouldn't solicit it. The fact that Joanne was fishing for compliments and then dismissing the feedback each time might indicate a pattern of behavior that's draining for others. The user's response is a reasonable boundary, not an attack. Therefore, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong here. So the answer would be B.\n"
