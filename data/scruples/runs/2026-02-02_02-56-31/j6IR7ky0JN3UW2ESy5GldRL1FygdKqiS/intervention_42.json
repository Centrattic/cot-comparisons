  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important for the sport. They have various body types, and Joanne, who has a similar body to the speaker, often criticizes her own body. The speaker tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it, saying only her own opinion matters. Then the speaker told her to stop if she doesn't want their opinions, which made Joanne offended.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The team has a range of body types, so there's already diversity. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it, which can be hurtful to others who might feel pressured or uncomfortable. The speaker is trying to set a boundary by saying if Joanne doesn't want their opinion, she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nFrom a psychological perspective, this is about body image issues and how to handle them in a group setting. The speaker is standing up for themselves and others by not allowing Joanne to create a negative environment. The key points here are the speaker's right to set boundaries and the importance of fostering a positive atmosphere in the team. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of compassion. Joanne might be struggling with her self-image, and the speaker's response could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. But the speaker isn't attacking her or mocking, just asserting that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't ask for it. It's about personal space and respect for both parties' feelings. \n\nIn many cases, when someone repeatedly brings up negative self-talk and rejects positive feedback, others might feel it's their responsibility to address it. The speaker is trying to prevent others from feeling they have to respond every time Joanne makes a comment. It's a form of self-defense and protecting the team's morale. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne's reaction shows she's not open to the speaker's approach. The speaker might have handled it differently, like addressing it privately first, but the intent here is to stop the pattern. The speaker isn't being cruel; they're trying to maintain a supportive environment. \n\nConsidering all this, the speaker isn't in the wrong. They're taking a stand against harmful behavior that affects the team's dynamic. So the answer is B.\n"
