Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne keeps complaining about her weight and then dismissing the compliments others give her. The author confronts her after she does this multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weight is a sensitive topic, especially in a group setting. Joanne is repeatedly bringing up her insecurities, which could be triggering for others. The author is trying to set a boundary by saying if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. But the question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that Joanne's behavior is creating a negative environment. By calling others out, the author is protecting the team's morale. But on the other hand, the author might have been abrupt. Maybe a more supportive approach could have been taken, like discussing the issue privately rather than publicly. However, the author's intention seems to be about setting boundaries rather than being mean. Since Joanne was fishing for compliments and then dismissing them, the author's response could be seen as necessary to prevent others from feeling pressured to engage in that behavior.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The author noticed a pattern of behavior that others might find uncomfortable. 2) The author's response was direct but aimed at stopping the cycle of insecurity. 3) The context is a sports team where body image can be a big issue. The author isn't criticizing Joanne's weight directly but is addressing the need for Joanne to stop seeking validation through others' opinions. So, the author is probably not in the wrong here.\n"
