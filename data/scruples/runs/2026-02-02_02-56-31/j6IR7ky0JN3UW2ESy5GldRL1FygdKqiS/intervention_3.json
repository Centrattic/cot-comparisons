Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: they're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne has a similar body type and seems insecure. She repeatedly comments on her own weight, gets validation from others, but then dismisses their opinions. The user finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne gets offended.\n\nThe user's main concern is whether they overstepped. Let me think about the dynamics here. Body image issues are common, especially in sports. But Joanne is seeking validation then deflecting it. The user tried to support her, then set a boundary after repeated behavior.\n\nIs it right to set a boundary? People have the right to express their feelings, but others can also set limits. The user's response was direct but not mean. They were protecting themselves from the cycle of seeking and dismissing compliments. Joanne's reaction might be defensive, but the user's action is about their own comfort.\n\nPossible angles: Could the user have handled it differently? Maybe, but they weren't in the wrong. The key is mutual respect. The user isn't bullying Joanne; they're asking her to respect their boundaries. So answer B (No) makes sense here. Joanne's behavior is an issue, not the user's response.\n"
