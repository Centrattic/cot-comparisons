Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author's teammates, including Joanne, have similar body types. Joanne is self-critical about her weight, and the author tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it, saying only her own opinion matters. The author then tells her not to bring it up if she doesn't want their opinions, leading to a somewhat offended reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's response was appropriate. Joanne was making negative self-comments, likely to seek reassurance, but then downplays others' input. The author's intervention was to set a boundary, saying that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't talk about it. This seems like a common issue with body image and the way people handle such comments.\n\nIn these situations, it's often considered harmful to reinforce negative body image by allowing self-criticism without challenge. The author tried to be supportive initially but then decided to address the pattern. The key here is whether the author's approach was constructive. By telling Joanne not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback, the author is redirecting the conversation. However, some might argue that this could come off as dismissive, especially if Joanne is struggling with her self-image.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be protecting their own mental health by not enabling the negative self-talk. The team's culture is important, and the author's response could be seen as standing up for a more positive environment. It's also possible that Joanne's behavior is affecting the team's dynamics, so the author is trying to address it.\n\nBut the answer depends on the context. If Joanne is using these comments to seek support, then the author's response might be cutting off the opportunity for her to feel supported. However, if Joanne is just trying to make others feel uncomfortable or is engulfed in her own insecurities, the author's boundary is reasonable.\n\nLooking at the interactions, Joanne is essentially asking for validation but then rejecting it. The author's final statement is a polite way to stop the cycle. It's not an attack on Joanne, just a setting of limits. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
