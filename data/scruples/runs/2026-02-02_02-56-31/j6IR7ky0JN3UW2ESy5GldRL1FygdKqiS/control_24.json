Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight in a negative way, and the author tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. The options are A (yes, the author is wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't an issue, and there's a range of body types. Joanne is similar in build to the author but seems to have body image issues. She's looking in the mirror, poking her belly, and saying she's fat. The author tries to give a compliment, but Joanne dismisses it, saying only her opinion matters. She does this to three people. The author then tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't talk about it around them. Joanne is offended.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's response was wrong. The key points are about body image issues and how to handle them. Joanne's behavior might stem from insecurity, which could be a sign of something deeper, like an eating disorder or low self-esteem. The author is trying to address the negative self-talk by setting a boundary. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible that the author's approach is valid. Joanne initiated the conversation about her weight, and the author is pointing out that if she doesn't want validation, she shouldn't seek it out. However, maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is supporting their teammate by not giving into the negative comments but then setting a boundary when it's repeated. On the other hand, maybe the author should have handled it differently, like addressing Joanne's insecurities without cutting her off. But given that Joanne was doing this to multiple people and the author's response was a direct consequence, it's a way to stop the cycle of negative self-talk. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's important to consider intent and impact. The author's intent might be to stop the negative behavior and encourage Joanne to have a healthier self-image. However, the impact might be that Joanne feels shamed or dismissed. But since Joanne was the one bringing it up each time, the author's response is a form of redirecting the conversation. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary in response to repeated behavior. The issue is Joanne's self-talk, and the author is trying to address it by saying that if she's not open to positive feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
