Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a college sports team where one teammate, Joanne, is making comments about her weight. The author of the question tried to reassure Joanne but then got frustrated when Joanne dismissed their compliment and repeated this with others. The author then told Joanne not to talk about it if she didn't want opinions. Now the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, and weight isn't relevant to their sport. Joanne is criticizing her own body, which can create a negative environment. The author intervened by complimenting her, but Joanne dismissed it. Then the author told Joanne to stop if she didn't want their opinions. \n\nBody image issues are common, especially in young adults. But in a team setting, constant self-criticism might affect others. The author's intention was to stop the negative behavior. However, maybe the author could have approached it differently, like a private conversation instead of confronting her in front of others. But the key point is that the author stood up for themselves and others by setting a boundary. \n\nJoanne was fishing for compliments and then dismissing them, which is manipulative. The author's response was to tell Joanne to stop if she didn't want feedback. That seems reasonable because Joanne's behavior was creating a negative environment. The author isn't wrong for wanting to stop the cycle of self-criticism and seeking validation from others. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
