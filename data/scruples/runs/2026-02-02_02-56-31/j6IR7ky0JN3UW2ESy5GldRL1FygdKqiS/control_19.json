Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did something wrong by telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, the background: They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The team has various body types, and there's a lot of insecurity. Joanne, similar in body type to the author, keeps looking at her reflection, poking her belly, and saying she's fat. The author and others try to compliment, but Joanne dismisses their opinions, saying only her own matters. After a third time, the author tells Joanne not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nSo, the author's action was to set a boundary. They were probably trying to stop the negative self-talk that Joanne was engaging in, which might be affecting team morale. Joanne was seeking validation but then invalidating others' attempts to support her. The author might have felt fed up with Joanne's constant self-criticism and the cycle of seeking and rejecting compliments.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't attack Joanne directly. They just told her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want feedback. That seems like a reasonable way to address the situation. Joanne's behavior was probably contributing to a negative environment, and the author might have been trying to protect their own mental health and the team's atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have handled it more sensitively. But Joanne was being dismissive each time, so maybe the author had no choice but to address it. The key here is that the author was trying to stop the behavior that was causing insecurity in others. Since it's a team environment, supporting each other is important. Joanne's actions might be harmful, and the author was trying to set a boundary to prevent that.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They were trying to handle a situation where a teammate's negative self-talk was affecting others, and they set a boundary which is a valid action.\n"
