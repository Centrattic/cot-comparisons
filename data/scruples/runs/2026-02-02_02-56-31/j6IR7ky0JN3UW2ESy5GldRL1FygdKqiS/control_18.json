Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight, getting compliments, then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't an issue, and body types vary. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then invalidating others' comments. The author's response was direct, saying if she doesn't want their opinions, don't talk about it.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author's intention was to stop the negative behavior that affects others. Joanne was making others uncomfortable by seeking compliments and then dismissing them. The author's response was a way to set a boundary. However, maybe the approach could have been softer, but the main point is whether they were in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author had the right to set boundaries if Joanne's behavior was affecting the team's environment. However, sometimes in such situations, a more empathetic approach is better, but the core issue is that the author acted to stop something that was bothering them and their teammates. So the answer might be B (No), because they were standing up for themselves and others, though maybe the method could be improved. But the question is about being wrong, not about the best approach. So likely the answer is B.\n"
