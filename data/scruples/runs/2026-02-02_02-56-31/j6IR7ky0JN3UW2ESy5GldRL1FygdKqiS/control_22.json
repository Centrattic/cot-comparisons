Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't important for their sport. The author is one of the teammates, and there's this teammate named Joanne who keeps talking about how she's fat, even though she's actually slim. The author and others tell her she looks great, but she responds by saying that only her own opinion matters. This happens three times with different teammates. Then the author tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up around them. Joanne gets offended.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport they play doesn't value weight, so body image issues might not be as relevant. The teammates have different body types, which suggests a variety is normal here. Joanne is similar in build to the author, so maybe she's comparing herself to others or feeling insecure.\n\nJoanne's behavior seems like she's seeking reassurance. She says \"I'm so fat\" and then when complemented, says only her opinion matters. This could be a common way people with body image issues seek validation. The author and others are trying to be supportive, but Joanne is pushing back. \n\nThe author's response is to tell Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't talk about it around them. This seems like a direct way to address the issue. The author is setting a boundary because they feel their input isn't wanted. But Joanne's reaction is to get offended, implying she might not see her behavior as problematic.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent and the impact. The author's intention was to stop Joanne from bringing up her weight since she was getting defensive. The author might feel that Joanne's repeated comments are creating a negative environment, especially if others are also uncomfortable. However, Joanne might feel that the author is dismissing her feelings or not supporting her enough. \n\nIn team settings, especially in sports where body image can be a sensitive topic, it's important to foster a supportive environment. The author's approach could be seen as a way to protect both themselves and the team from unnecessary negativity. On the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like talking to Joanne privately or addressing it without cutting off support entirely. But given that Joanne was already defensive each time, the author's response might be a reasonable boundary.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to address the issue by setting a boundary after repeated negative comments. The problem might be more on Joanne's side for perpetually seeking reassurance and then invalidating others' input. The author's response is a way to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and defensiveness. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
