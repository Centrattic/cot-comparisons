Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The team has various body types, and one teammate, Joanne, keeps talking about her weight, saying she's fat even though others say she looks great. She does this to multiple people, and when the author finally tells her that if she doesn't want opinions she shouldn't bring it up, Joanne gets offended.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about body image and how to handle negative self-talk. The author is trying to stop the conversation because they think it's unnecessary and maybe harmful. Joanne's behavior is leading to insecurity in others, and the author is setting a boundary. But is that the right approach?\n\nWell, in a team environment, especially where body image can be an issue, supporting each other is important. Joanne is engaging in self-deprecation, which can be toxic. The author's response is to tell her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want feedback. That might come off as dismissive, but it's also a way to prevent the negative behavior from spreading. The author isn't attacking Joanne but is standing up for themselves and possibly others by ending the unproductive conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne's actions are about her own insecurities, and the author's response could be seen as not being supportive. But if the author is trying to create a positive environment where people don't reinforce negative self-talk, they might be right. It's a balance between respecting Joanne's feelings and maintaining a positive team dynamic.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're setting a boundary to protect themselves and others from harmful comments. The alternative would be to let Joanne keep making negative statements, which isn't helpful. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
