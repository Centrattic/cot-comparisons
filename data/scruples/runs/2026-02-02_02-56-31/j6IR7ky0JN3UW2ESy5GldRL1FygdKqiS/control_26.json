Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The scenario is in a college sports team where weight isn't important for their sport. The author and Joanne have similar body types but Joanne is insecure. She keeps complaining about her body and then dismissing others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne is making negative comments about herself in front of others, maybe seeking reassurance but then invalidating their responses. The author, after three instances, tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nWell, promoting positive body image is important, especially in environments where insecurity can be high, like sports teams. Joanne's behavior could create a negative atmosphere or contribute to others' insecurities. The author's response might be an attempt to address that. However, the author could have handled it differently, like talking to Joanne privately first. But since Joanne was doing it in front of others multiple times, the author's public comment might be a way to set a boundary. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? The author isn't being mean, just setting a boundary. Joanne's behavior is the issue because she's seeking validation then dismissing others. The author's approach might be a valid way to stop the negative talk. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to foster a healthier environment by addressing the constant body criticism.\n"
