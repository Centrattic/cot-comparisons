  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is part of a college sports team where body image isn't a factor in their sport. They mention that their teammate Joanne constantly expresses insecurity about her weight, which the user and others try to address with compliments. But when Joanne dismisses their feedback and says it's only about her own thoughts, the user tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nI need to figure out if the user was in the wrong. The key points are the user's response to Joanne's repeated comments. The user is trying to set a boundary, which seems reasonable if they feel uncomfortable. However, Joanne might perceive it as dismissive. But since the user directly asked her to stop talking about her weight after she kept doing it, that's setting a clear boundary. The user's intention was to stop the negative self-talk, not to be rude. So the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
