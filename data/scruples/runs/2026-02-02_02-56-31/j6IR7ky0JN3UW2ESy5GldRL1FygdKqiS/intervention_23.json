  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight, looking in the mirror, and then dismissing others' compliments. The user finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is whether the user was in the wrong by setting that boundary. Let me break it down. Joanne's behavior seems to be about seeking validation but then invalidating others' attempts to support her. The user tried to be kind initially but felt that Joanne was being dismissive. When someone repeatedly brings up a topic and then ignores the feedback, it's natural to set a boundary. \n\nThe user's response was a bit direct, but it's also about protecting the group's environment from unnecessary negativity. In a team setting, especially with peers, maintaining a positive atmosphere is important. The user might have felt that Joanne's comments were causing insecurity or creating a toxic environment. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a more constructive way to handle it. Like suggesting she talk to a counselor if she's struggling with body image. But the user's approach was to stop engaging, which is a form of boundary-setting. They aren't attacking Joanne but saying that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nIs that being inconsiderate? Well, Joanne was the one initiating the conversation each time. The user's response was a logical consequence. So I think the user isn't in the wrong here. They tried to support initially but had to set a boundary to prevent the pattern from continuing. Answer B.\n"
