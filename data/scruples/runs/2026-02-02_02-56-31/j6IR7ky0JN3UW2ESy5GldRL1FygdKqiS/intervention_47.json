  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their teammate, Joanne, to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the motivations. The user wanted to stop the negative self-talk because it's creating an uncomfortable environment. Joanne's behavior might be fostering insecurity among teammates. The user's response was direct but seems to be trying to set a boundary.\n\nIs the user at fault? Well, Joanne initiated the conversation each time, so the user was reacting to that. The user's comment was a reasonable response after multiple instances. It's about self-esteem issues, and the user was trying to prevent others from feeling pressured to comment on their bodies. However, the user could have approached it more gently, maybe by discussing it privately instead of publicly calling Joanne out. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because the user was addressing a harmful behavior, even if the delivery could be improved. Joanne was the one making the comments, so the user isn't at fault for wanting to stop that.\n"
