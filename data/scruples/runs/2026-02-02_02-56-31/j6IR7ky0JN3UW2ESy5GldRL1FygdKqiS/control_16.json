Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a college sports team where weight isn't important. The writer's teammate, Joanne, keeps commenting on her own weight, getting compliments, and then dismissing them by saying only her opinion matters. The writer then tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The question is whether the writer is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and weight isn't relevant to their sport. Joanne's behavior seems to be about insecurity and seeking validation, which she then rejects. The writer is trying to address the constant negative talk and the cycle of seeking and dismissing compliments. \n\nThe writer's response was to say that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. The key here is whether that's an appropriate response to someone else's behavior. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally acceptable to set boundaries. If someone is repeatedly engaging in behavior that you find uncomfortable or unnecessary, it's reasonable to address it. The writer isn't attacking Joanne directly but is pointing out that by initiating the conversation, others' opinions are offered. Joanne's reaction might be defensive, but the writer's intent is to stop the cycle of seeking validation through negative self-talk.\n\nHowever, one could argue that the writer might have approached it differently. Maybe a more empathetic approach would be better, like addressing Joanne's insecurity without making it about the others' input. But the writer's action was a direct response, not an attack. \n\nAlso, considering that weight issues in athletes can be sensitive, especially in sports where body image is a concern. The writer is in a position to support teammates but also to promote a positive environment. By stopping Joanne's behavior, they're trying to prevent others from feeling pressured to comment or from being affected by Joanne's self-criticism.\n\nSo, the writer isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary and trying to address a pattern of behavior that's not healthy. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
