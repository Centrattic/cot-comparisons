  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. They have diverse body types, which is good. One teammate, Joanne, has a similar build to the user. Joanne seems to be struggling with her body image. She starts talking about her weight in a negative way, like saying she's \"so fat\" when looking at the mirror and poking her belly. The user responds by saying she looks great. Joanne then says that it's just what the user says and that only her opinion matters. She repeats this with two more teammates, getting compliments and then dismissing them. Finally, the user tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't talk about it around them. Joanne reacts with an offended look and says \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is part of a team where weight isn't a concern, so Joanne's comments might stem from personal insecurity rather than sport-related pressure. The user tried to be supportive by giving Joanne a compliment, which is a kind response. However, Joanne keeps seeking reassurance but then invalidates the others' opinions. \n\nThe user's response here is to set a boundary. They're saying that if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring up the topic. That seems like a reasonable boundary. It's about not engaging in negative self-talk and encouraging a positive environment, especially in a team setting where mental health and morale can be important. \n\nBut maybe the user could have handled it differently. Perhaps approaching Joanne privately to talk about how her comments affect the team? Or maybe the user is right to set the boundary because Joanne is using the teammates as a sounding board for her insecurities. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might just be struggling with body image issues, and the user's response might come off as dismissive or judgmental. However, the user was trying to be supportive but Joanne kept invalidating their efforts. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user's action seems like a reasonable boundary. They're not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
