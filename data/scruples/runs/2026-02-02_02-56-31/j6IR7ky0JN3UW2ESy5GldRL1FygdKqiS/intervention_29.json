  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body, then dismisses others' compliments. The user finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the user was right to set that boundary. On one hand, Joanne's behavior is clearly about seeking validation and then rejecting it, which can be frustrating. The user probably wanted to end the cycle where Joanne gets attention for her insecurity. But on the other hand, was it kind or appropriate to tell her not to talk about it?\n\nI think the user's intention was to stop the negative self-talk, which is understandable. However, instead of cutting off the conversation entirely, maybe they could have addressed Joanne's behavior more gently. But in the context, Joanne was doing this repeatedly, and the user might have felt it was necessary to set a boundary. Since weight doesn't matter in their sport, the focus on body image is misplaced. The user's response might have been a way to redirect the conversation.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? If Joanne was being self-deprecating, and others were trying to support her but she dismissed it, then the user's action is about stopping the negative behavior. However, the user could have approached it with more empathy. But considering the situation, maybe the user is justified. The answer might be B, No, because they were trying to stop the negative behavior and set a boundary.\n"
