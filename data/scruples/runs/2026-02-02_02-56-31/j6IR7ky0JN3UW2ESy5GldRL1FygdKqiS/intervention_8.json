  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they were wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight when she repeatedly made negative comments about herself and sought compliments. The context is a college sports team where body image might be a sensitive topic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne is making negative self-comments, and the user is trying to be supportive by complimenting her. But Joanne dismisses the compliment, implying that only her own opinion matters. Then she does this to two more teammates, and the user finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their input. Joanne reacts with an offended look.\n\nSo, the key points are: the user's intention was to be kind, but after repeated instances, they set a boundary. The user's action was to stop the conversation because it's not helpful. Is the user in the wrong for setting that boundary?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the user overstepped. The user was trying to protect their teammates from unnecessary negativity. By saying that Joanne shouldn't talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions, they're encouraging Joanne to be more mindful of how her comments affect others. This seems like a reasonable response. The user isn't attacking Joanne but pointing out that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't seek it out. Joanne's reaction was defensive, which might indicate she didn't realize her behavior was affecting others negatively.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the user could have handled it more gently. But given that Joanne repeated the behavior three times, the user's frustration makes sense. The user's comment was direct, but it's about setting a boundary in a group setting. Since the team includes diverse body types and weight isn't important in their sport, the user's approach to stop the negative focus is valid. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). They were addressing a recurring issue and setting a boundary to prevent hurtful self-deprecation in a group context.\n"
