Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. \n\nSo the context is that they're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. The teammate, Joanne, keeps saying she's fat, even when others compliment her. The author tells her to stop talking about it because she's not interested in their opinions if she's just going to dismiss them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne is engaging in self-critical comments and seeking validation but then dismissing the responses. That can be a common pattern in people with body image issues. The author is probably trying to set a boundary to protect themselves from the negativity or maybe to stop enabling the behavior.\n\nBut is the author wrong for setting that boundary? If Joanne's comments are making the environment uncomfortable, then the author has a right to speak up. However, it's important to consider the intent and the method. The author's response was direct but not confrontational. They're saying that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. That's a reasonable boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have approached it more compassionately, like checking in if Joanne was okay or offering support. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. The author's action was a response to repeated behavior, so they might not be in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nAlso, considering the team environment, promoting body positivity is important. The author might be trying to create a space where negative self-talk isn't encouraged. So, the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
