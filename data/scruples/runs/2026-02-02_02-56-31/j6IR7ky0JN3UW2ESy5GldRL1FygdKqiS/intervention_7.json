  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: they're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne, who has a similar body type, keeps making negative comments about her own weight and then dismisses others' compliments. The user tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne reacts with an offended look.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The user's intention seems to be about setting a boundary. Joanne's behavior is possibly rooted in insecurity and seeking validation, then dismissing it. The user's response is direct but not harsh. They're trying to address the cycle of negative self-talk and the frustration of giving a compliment that gets dismissed.\n\nFrom a mental health perspective, body image issues are common, especially in young athletes. The user might be trying to protect themselves from the negative energy. But Joanne might feel that her feelings are being invalidated. However, the user's statement is about setting a personal boundary, not attacking Joanne. They're saying if the conversation isn't wanted, then avoid it. That's a valid boundary.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Probably not. They're reacting to repeated behavior that's creating discomfort. The response is about their own feelings and the group's dynamic. Unless the user's response was aggressive or unkind, which it doesn't seem, they're not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
