  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body, then dismissing others' compliments by saying it's only her opinion that matters. The user decided to tell her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is part of a college sports team where body types vary. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it, which can be a common issue with body image concerns. The user's response was to set a boundary, which is understandable given the repeated behavior. \n\nIs the user wrong for setting that boundary? Well, they had a valid reason: Joanne was repeatedly making these comments, which could create a negative environment. The user's comment was a way to stop the cycle of seeking and dismissing compliments. However, the user might not have considered that Joanne might be struggling with self-esteem, and a more supportive approach could help. But the user also has the right to set boundaries, especially if they're uncomfortable with the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user could have addressed it more privately instead of in the moment. But given that Joanne was doing this multiple times, the user might have felt it was necessary to speak up. The response wasn't harsh; it was a direct but not unkind way to communicate the boundary.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They were protecting their own comfort and the team's environment. However, there might be a better way to handle it in the future, like discussing it privately. But at the moment, their action was justified. Answer B.\n"
