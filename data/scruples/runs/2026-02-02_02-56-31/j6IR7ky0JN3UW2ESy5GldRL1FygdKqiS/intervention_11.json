  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance, and there's a variety of body types. Joanne is slim but seems insecure, and she keeps making negative comments about her body, then dismisses others' compliments.\n\nFirst, the user's action was to respond to three instances where Joanne and others were given compliments but then told opinions don't matter. Then the user said, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it.\" Joanne reacted with offense. The user is wondering if they were wrong to say that.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The user is standing up for themselves and others by pointing out that if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't make comments that invite it. But the user might be accused of being rude or not supportive. However, Joanne's behavior is likely rooted in insecurity, and the user is trying to set a boundary.\n\nIn a team setting, body image issues can be common among young women, especially in sports. The user's response could be seen as assertive and setting a boundary, which is important for their own mental health and that of others. Joanne's behavior might be triggering others, so the user's reaction is a way to address that without enabling negative self-talk.\n\nBut there's a line between setting boundaries and being dismissive. The user's comment was direct, but maybe it could have been handled more sensitively. However, the user was pushing back against Joanne's pattern of seeking validation then dismissing others, which is a valid boundary.\n\nSo, considering that the user was standing up against a toxic pattern and promoting a positive environment, they're probably not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
