Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: they're part of a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. The team has diverse body types, and the teammate, Joanne, is similar in build. Joanne often expresses body insecurity, like poking her belly and saying \"I'm so fat.\" The user and others try to reassure her, but she dismisses their compliments by saying it's only her opinion that matters. After three instances, the user tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne reacts with an offended look.\n\nThe user is wondering if they were wrong to respond that way. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider the dynamics. The user is trying to set a boundary to stop the negative talk. Joanne is engaging in self-deprecating comments and then invalidating others' reassurances. The user's approach is direct but maybe a bit abrupt. However, in a team setting, fostering a supportive environment is important. If Joanne is using these comments to seek validation but then dismissing it, it can create a toxic cycle. The user's response aims to break that cycle by saying if she doesn't want input, she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nBut is this the right approach? Some might argue that telling someone to stop talking about their feelings could be dismissive. However, in this context, the user is trying to protect the team's positive environment. Joanne's behavior might be harmful if it's causing others to feel uncomfortable or if it's perpetuating a culture of body insecurity. The user's approach is a form of assertive communication to set boundaries, which can be appropriate if the goal is to prevent the spread of negative self-talk.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe a more empathetic approach could have been taken. Instead of a direct confrontation, perhaps addressing it with more understanding, like explaining how the comments affect others. But the user's method is a valid way to enforce boundaries, especially if they felt the comments were becoming a pattern.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The user isn't being cruel; they're trying to maintain a positive team atmosphere. Joanne's reaction suggests she might not have expected the directness, but the user's response is justified in this scenario. So, the answer would likely be B (no, not in the wrong).\n"
