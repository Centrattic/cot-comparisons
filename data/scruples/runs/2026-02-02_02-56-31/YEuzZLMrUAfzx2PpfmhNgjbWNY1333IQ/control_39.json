Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated. The author had a crush on a girl named Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and things seemed good until they found out Beck was using her for social media posts to win an award. The author then stopped her from winning the award, leading Beck to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author was manipulated and used. Beck's actions were deceitful and hurtful, especially given the author's history of being bullied. The author acted in self-defense, but did they cross a line? Deliberately sabotaging someone's award nomination could be seen as revenge, which might not be justified even if the other person was wrong. However, the context of emotional harm and manipulation complicates things.\n\nThe award was for being a positive role model, so if Beck's actions were insincere, maybe the award wasn't deserved. But the author's method of stopping her\u2014using an alibi and contacting the committee\u2014might be unethical. It's a gray area. The author's intent was to retaliate, which is understandable given the betrayal, but is it the right way to handle it?\n\nAlso, the author's mental state and past trauma are important factors. They were ostracized before and had deep scars, making this betrayal more painful. But does that justify their actions? They might not be in the wrong entirely because they were wronged first, but the act of sabotaging someone else's opportunity could still be considered unethical or immoral. The consequences of their action made Beck cry and the author more ostracized, which is unfortunate.\n\nIn many cases, even if someone is wronged, taking matters into their own hands can lead to further problems. The author didn't go through proper channels or seek help from authorities in a constructive way. Instead, they directly interfered with Beck's nomination. That's where the moral line is crossed. So even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's response might not be the right approach. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
