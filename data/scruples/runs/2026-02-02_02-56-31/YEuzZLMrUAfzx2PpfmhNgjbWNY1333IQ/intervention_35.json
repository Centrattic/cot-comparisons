  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a crush on a classmate named Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and things seemed good. But then they found out Beck was using their feelings to boost her own social media presence and win an award. The person then took steps to stop her from winning, which caused Beck to cry and the person now faces backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The person discovered that Beck was insincere and using them for an award. They then took action to remove Beck's nomination, possibly by contacting the committee. The question is whether this was justified or not.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's behavior was manipulative and hurtful. She led the person on with fake kindness to achieve her own goals. That's definitely wrong, and the person felt betrayed. Their emotional pain is valid. However, the person's response was to interfere with the award process, which might not be the right approach. Instead of confronting Beck or the committee through proper channels, they directly caused the nomination to be withdrawn, which could be seen as taking matters into their own hands.\n\nEthically, retaliating by undermining someone else's achievements, even if they wronged you, can be problematic. It's important to consider the broader implications. The person might have felt justified because of the betrayal, but causing harm to Beck, even if she was in the wrong, could still be considered the wrong action. The person's motivation was revenge, which isn't a valid justification for unethical behavior.\n\nAlso, the consequences: Beck is now upset and the person faces ostracism. The person might not have remorse, but their actions disrupted a system (award committee) and hurt someone else. Even if Beck's actions were bad, the response could be seen as equally hurtful. There might have been better ways to handle it, like talking to Beck directly or seeking support from authorities without sabotaging her chances.\n\nSo, while Beck's actions were definitely wrong, the person's method of retaliation might not be the right approach. The key point is whether the person's actions were proportionate and ethical. Sabotage isn't typically considered a correct response, even in cases of betrayal. Therefore, the person is likely in the wrong for their actions, despite the circumstances. Their feelings of betrayal don't excuse unethical behavior. Hence, the answer might be A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
