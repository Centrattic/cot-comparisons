  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this scenario. So, the user is a 17-year-old who had a crush on a classmate named Beck. They went through a lot to ask her out, and for a while, everything seemed great. But then they found out that Beck was using the relationship for her own benefit\u2014specifically, to get a positive role model award by pretending to be kind to someone she considered ugly. The user felt betrayed and decided to stop Beck from winning the award, which led to Beck crying and the user becoming more ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the user's actions were wrong. The user discovered that Beck was insincere and manipulative. The user's response was to interfere with Beck's award nomination. The key here is intent and the consequences. \n\nThe user was hurt and felt used. Their actions were motivated by a sense of betrayal. However, even if the user's feelings are valid, the method they chose\u2014intentionally sabotaging someone else's award\u2014might be problematic. It's a form of revenge, which can be seen as morally wrong, regardless of the reason. \n\nBut then, Beck was being deceptive. If Beck was lying to the award committee about her actions, the user might have done the right thing by exposing her. However, the user didn't go through the proper channels to report the deception. Instead, they took matters into their own hands. \n\nThe line between justice and revenge is thin here. If the user had reported Beck to the appropriate authorities with evidence, that would be one thing. But the user's method of stopping her nomination might have been inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the consequences: Beck is now upset, and the user is more ostracized. This shows that the situation didn't resolve the emotional pain and instead caused more harm. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, it's important to act within the bounds of the system. Sabotaging someone's award is likely unethical and could be considered in the wrong, regardless of the motivation. \n\nSo, balancing the user's legitimate hurt with the ethical implications of their actions, the answer would likely be that the user is in the wrong. Even if Beck was manipulative, the user's method of response was not the correct approach.\n"
