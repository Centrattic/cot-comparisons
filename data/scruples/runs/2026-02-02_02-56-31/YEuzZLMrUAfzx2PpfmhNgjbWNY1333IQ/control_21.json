Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a crush on this girl, Beck, who they think was using them for her own gain to win an award. The author then took action to stop Beck from winning the award, which led to Beck crying and the author being ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author felt betrayed after finding out that Beck was only being nice to them for a short time to help with her college application. The author then researched the award, confirmed Beck was nominated, and took steps to have her nomination withdrawn. The author has no remorse and feels satisfied, but others think they're wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Beck supposedly used the author's feelings to gain social points and community service for an award. That's pretty manipulative and unethical. However, the author's retaliation involved intentionally sabotaging Beck's nomination. Even if Beck was in the wrong, did the author have the right to interfere with the award process?\n\nLegally, maybe the author didn't break any laws, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author might feel justified because they were hurt, but taking matters into their own hands to sabotage someone else's opportunity could be seen as revenge rather than a fair response. The author's actions caused Beck emotional distress, and now the author is facing more ostracism. \n\nAlso, considering the author's past trauma with bullying due to their appearance, this situation might have triggered deeper insecurities. However, that doesn't excuse the sabotage. The right approach might have been to address the manipulation with Beck directly, perhaps report the behavior to authorities, or seek support without retaliating. \n\nAnother angle: the award committee withdrawing the nomination\u2014how did the author do that? If the author provided false information or harassed the committee, that's definitely wrong. If they just informed them of Beck's manipulative behavior, maybe that's a different story. But the author didn't specify the method. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, revenge often isn't considered the right path. Even if one person is at fault, the other's response should ideally be constructive. The author's actions led to emotional harm, so there's a responsibility there. However, Beck's manipulation was also wrong. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: Beck manipulated the author for her own gain, which is unethical. The author then took revenge, which is also unethical. But who is more in the wrong? The question is about the author's responsibility. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they chose to retaliate in a harmful way, even if provoked. But some might argue that Beck's actions were worse. \n\nHowever, the question is about the author's actions. Even if Beck was manipulative, the author's decision to sabotage her award is still a wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
