  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong based on their situation. So, they had a crush on this girl named Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then they found out she was using the relationship for her own gain, like for a college award. The person felt hurt and decided to stop her from winning the award, which made her cry. Now they're being criticized and want to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The person discovered that Beck was manipulating her interactions for an award, which is unethical. The person then took action by getting her nomination withdrawn. That action involved checking online, confirming with authorities, and using friends and family as alibis. That sounds like some kind of sabotage.\n\nIs sabotaging someone's award a justified response? Even if the person was being used, intentionally ruining someone else's opportunity could be considered wrong. However, the person felt betrayed and hurt, which might affect their judgment. The question is whether their actions were a proportionate response.\n\nAlso, the person mentions that Beck made posts about their appearance, which could contribute to a toxic environment. But using that as a reason to retaliate might not be the right approach. The person's actions might have been driven by pain and a desire for revenge rather than a constructive solution.\n\nAnother angle: the person's emotional state after being manipulated and publicly made fun of. They might have been vulnerable and acted out of hurt. But regardless of intent, intentionally causing harm to someone else, even if they were wrong, is generally not considered acceptable behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the person is now being ostracized, which adds to the complexity. The consequences of their actions are affecting their social standing, which might be a result of their decision to retaliate.\n\nIn ethical terms, even if Beck did something wrong, the victim shouldn't commit a wrong action in return. The cycle of retaliation can perpetuate harm. However, the person's actions might be seen as a form of justice in their eyes, but society usually upholds non-retaliation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person's actions might be seen as wrong because they took it upon themselves to sabotage Beck's award without going through proper channels. Instead of addressing the situation through communication or reporting the manipulation, they chose to retaliate, which is unethical. Therefore, the answer would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
