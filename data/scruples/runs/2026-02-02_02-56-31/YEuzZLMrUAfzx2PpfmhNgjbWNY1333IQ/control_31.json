Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author sabotaging a classmate (Beck) from winning an award because Beck used him for social media clout and then planned to distance him. The author felt hurt, researched the award, and took actions that led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn, causing Beck to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author was in a vulnerable position, having been bullied due to scars. He genuinely liked Beck and was manipulated. Beck's actions were deceitful and exploitative, which is clearly wrong. However, the author's response was to actively interfere with Beck's award nomination. \n\nIs sabotage ever justifiable? Even if someone is in the wrong, retaliating can have consequences. The author's actions led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn, which might have been against the rules of the award process. The author might have violated privacy or other policies by reporting Beck, even if Beck was being manipulative. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact: Beck is now ostracized and crying. The author might have intended to hurt Beck back, which could be seen as harmful. However, Beck's initial manipulation was also harmful. \n\nBut legally and ethically, even if someone wrongs you, taking matters into your own hands by sabotaging them could be considered wrong. The author could have reported Beck through proper channels or sought help from authorities in a constructive way, rather than taking revenge. \n\nMoreover, the author's actions might have been impulsive and driven by hurt feelings. While Beck's actions were manipulative, the author's response bypassed proper procedures, which could be seen as unethical. So, even though Beck was in the wrong, the author's retaliation might still be considered wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because taking revenge and sabotaging someone's nomination is not the appropriate way to handle the situation, regardless of the initial wrongdoing.\n"
