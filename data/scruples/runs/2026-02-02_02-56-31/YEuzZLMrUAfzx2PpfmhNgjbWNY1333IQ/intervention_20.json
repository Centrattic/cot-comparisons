  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user, who's 17 and has a history of being bullied because of their scars, had a crush on a classmate named Beck. They went on a date, and it seemed like Beck was genuinely nice to them. But then the user found out that Beck was using their relationship for a \"positive role model\" award, pretending to be kind just to boost her college application. So the user decided to sabotage her nomination, leading Beck to cry and lose the award. Now the user is being criticized and is ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The user's actions were a form of revenge. Beck used the user's feelings for her own benefit, which is definitely wrong and manipulative. The user was hurt and felt betrayed. However, sabotaging someone else's award by interfering with the nomination process is also unethical. The user didn't go through the proper channels to report the manipulation; instead, they took matters into their own hands. This could be seen as a violation of trust and possibly even unethical behavior in response. \n\nOn the other hand, Beck's actions were deceitful. She led the user to believe that their relationship was genuine, which caused emotional harm. The user's response, while harsh, was a reaction to being manipulated and used. But does that justify their actions? Ethically, revenge is typically not considered the right approach. The user should have perhaps reported the situation to the authorities responsible for the award, provided evidence, and let them handle it. By doing it themselves, the user caused harm to Beck and now faces social consequences.\n\nAlso, the user's own experiences with bullying might have made them more vulnerable to manipulation and then more sensitive to being used. Their emotional state after the betrayal could explain the strong reaction, but it doesn't necessarily excuse the action of sabotaging the award. The user's friend and family might have supported them, but that doesn't validate the action in a broader sense.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, Beck definitely acted unethically by exploiting the user. However, the user's response, while understandable given the betrayal, is also unethical because it involved deceit or coercion to prevent Beck from receiving the award. The user might have felt justified, but their actions have consequences for both parties. The user is now also facing social repercussions, which is a direct result of their decision to take revenge rather than addressing it through appropriate channels.\n"
