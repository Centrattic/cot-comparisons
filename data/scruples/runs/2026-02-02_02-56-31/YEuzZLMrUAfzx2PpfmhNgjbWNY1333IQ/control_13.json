Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, who's 17 and has facial scars from an accident, was in a relationship with a girl named Back. He went to a lot of effort to ask her out, and they had a nice time. But then he found out that she had been using social media posts to make it look like she was being kind to him to win a 'positive role model' award. She apparently planned to distance him after March. The author then took action to stop her from winning the award, which caused her to cry and he's now being ostracized, but he feels no remorse.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified. On one hand, he was hurt by being manipulated, and the girl may have been using him for her own gain, which is definitely wrong. On the other hand, the author's response was to sabotage her award nomination, which led to her emotional distress. Even though he was wronged, intentionally harming someone else, especially in a way that could affect their opportunities, is generally considered unethical.\n\nBut there's a lot of context. The author has been bullied for his appearance and was vulnerable. He was genuinely in love and felt betrayed. However, the response of making her cry and ruining her award chances might be seen as a form of revenge, which isn't typically a good solution. The key points are the manipulation by the girl and the author's reaction. While her manipulation is inexcusable, his retaliation might cross a line. It's a complex situation where both parties have some fault, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The answer depends on whether revenge is ever justified. In most ethical frameworks, it's not. So the author is in the wrong for his actions despite being wronged.\n"
