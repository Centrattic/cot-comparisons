Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who has been bullied and has facial scars, had a crush on a classmate named Beck. They went on a date, and then found out Beck was using the author to win a \"positive role model\" award for her college application. Beck's friend told the author that Beck had planned to distance herself after March. The author then took action to stop Beck from winning the award, leading Beck to cry and the author facing more ostracism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The author discovered that Beck was manipulating their friendship to win an award. That's a betrayal. Beck's actions were unethical and possibly deceitful. The author's response was to contact the award committee and have the nomination withdrawn. The author also mentions using a friend and family as alibis, which might imply they tried to ensure their actions were covered up or justified. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Beck was being deceptive and using the author's personal feelings for her own gain. The author felt wronged and acted to stop Beck from benefiting from that deception. On the other hand, the author's method involved interfering with the award process, which might be seen as unethical or even retaliatory. \n\nThe author's motivation comes from a place of hurt and betrayal. They were already in a vulnerable position due to bullying, and this experience with Beck added to their emotional distress. However, taking action to sabotage Beck's award could be considered a breach of trust and a form of revenge. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's actions may not be justified because they prevented Beck from receiving an award that might have been legitimate otherwise (though her actions tainted it).\n\nBut there's also the aspect of Beck's insincerity. If Beck's nomination was based on false acts of kindness, then the award might not have been deserved. The author exposed the truth, which could be seen as a form of justice. However, the method of doing so\u2014perhaps anonymously or without giving Beck a chance to address it\u2014could be problematic. \n\nLegally, if the author provided information to the committee that led to the withdrawal, it's possible they were reporting unethical behavior. But the emotional impact on Beck and the school environment must be considered. The author's actions might have been a form of retaliation that caused harm, even if Beck was at fault.\n\nIn summary, Beck's manipulation was wrong, but the author's response might have been an appropriate reaction to correct a fraudulent nomination. However, the method and intent behind the author's actions could be seen as crossing a line, especially if done out of spite rather than a genuine desire to expose the truth. The author might be in the wrong because they took matters into their own hands instead of addressing the issue through proper channels, like reporting the deceit to the committee in a formal way. Alternatively, if the committee withdrew the nomination because Beck's actions were unethical, then the author's intervention might have been justified.\n\nThe key is whether the author's actions were a justified act of exposing the truth or an act of revenge. Since Beck was using the author for personal gain, the author's response could be seen as a way to protect their own dignity and prevent Beck from benefiting from deceit. However, the emotional response and the public nature of the action (making Beck cry) might indicate that the author acted out of anger and hurt, which could be considered wrong regardless of Beck's actions.\n"
