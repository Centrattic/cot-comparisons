Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a 17-year-old who has faced bullying due to facial scars from an accident. They had a crush on a girl named Beck, who they thought was genuine and kind. They went on a date and felt accepted, but then found out Beck was manipulating her friends and social media interactions to win an award. The user discovered this through a friend and decided to stop Beck from getting the award, leading Beck to cry and her nomination being withdrawn. Now the user is being criticized and ostracized, but they have no remorse.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: they used their friend's and family as alibis to report Beck, which caused her nomination to be withdrawn. The question is whether this is justified or wrong.\n\nBeck's actions: She pretended to be kind to the user to boost her own image for an award, using him as a prop for her social media. That's clearly manipulative and hurtful. The user was emotionally invested and felt betrayed, which is understandable.\n\nBut the user's response was to sabotage Beck's award. Even though Beck was in the wrong, retaliating by exposing her or causing her nomination to be revoked\u2014does that make the user right? \n\nLegally and ethically, if the user reported Beck to the committee with the truth (that she was faking her interactions), then maybe it's justified. However, the method might be questionable. Did they have the right to do that without giving Beck a chance to respond? Also, causing emotional harm (Beck crying) is a consequence, but was it necessary?\n\nThe user's intent was to stop Beck from lying to get an award, which is a positive intent. But their actions led to further ostracization and Beck's distress. The user might not be in the wrong because they were protecting themselves from manipulation and stopping a lie. However, the means of stopping it (exposing her) could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut in many cases, if someone is being used and then finds out the truth, it's sometimes considered within their rights to take action to prevent the exploitative person from benefiting. So the user might not be in the wrong. However, the emotional impact on Beck is significant, and the user could be seen as crossing a line by making her cry and ruining her chances for the award. \n\nBut Beck initiated the manipulation. The user was a victim of emotional exploitation. Retaliation could be seen as self-defense in a way, even if it's not the most mature approach. So maybe the answer is A, the user is in the wrong because they took matters into their own hands instead of addressing it directly with Beck or through proper channels. But since they found out through a friend and took action, maybe it's justified. \n\nAlternatively, the user's actions might have been a proportionate response given the betrayal. But is it ethical to let someone else's nomination be withdrawn? If it's a public award, and the committee was informed of false claims, maybe it's the right thing to do. \n\nThis is a tough one. The user's actions could be seen as standing up for themselves, but the method might be questionable. However, the fact that Beck was exploiting them for her own gain might justify the user's actions. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But others might argue the user should have handled it differently. Given that the user was a victim, perhaps the answer is B.\n"
