Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award after discovering the classmate used them for social media clout and college applications.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush and went to great lengths to ask the girl out, which was accepted. Then they found out the girl was using them for her own benefit, posting insincere things on social media, and then planning to distance the author after a short period. The author, feeling hurt and betrayed, took action by getting her nomination withdrawn, leading to her crying and the author becoming more ostracized.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions of both parties. The girl's actions were manipulative and exploitative, using the author's feelings for her own gain. The author, feeling wronged and after researching the award, took steps to retaliate. The question is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nEthically, revenge is often considered wrong because it involves harming someone else, even if they've done something wrong. However, the context matters. The author was already a victim of bullying and felt manipulated. The girl's actions were deceitful, and the author's retaliation might be seen as a form of justice in their eyes. But the method\u2014intentionally sabotaging someone's chances\u2014could be seen as crossing a line, even if the motive was revenge for being used.\n\nLegally, if the author used underhanded methods to withdraw the nomination (like spreading false information or hacking), that's definitely wrong. But the scenario doesn't specify illegal actions, just that they went to authorities. However, the moral aspect is about intent and proportionality. Even if the girl's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response might be seen as harsh and unforgiving, leading to further harm.\n\nThe author's emotional state after being betrayed and manipulated could influence their judgment. They might feel justified in their actions because of the emotional pain caused. But in terms of right and wrong, intentionally making someone cry and ruining their opportunity, even if they deserved it, is still harmful. It's a cycle of negativity.\n\nSo, while the girl's actions were definitely wrong, the author's retaliation also has consequences. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were proportionate and justified. In most ethical frameworks, revenge isn't considered the right course of action, even when wronged. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for taking matters into their own hands in a harmful way.\n"
