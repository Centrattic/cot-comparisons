Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who has a history of being bullied due to facial scars, had a crush on a girl named Beck. He went through a lot of effort to ask her out, and for a short time, he felt accepted and loved. But then he found out that Beck was only being nice to him as part of a scheme to win a \"positive role model\" award for her college application. She had her friends act nice to him, and then planned to distance themselves after March. The author, feeling hurt and betrayed, decided to stop her from winning the award by having the committee withdraw her nomination, which made her cry and got him ostracized again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. Beck used the author's feelings for her own gain, which is definitely wrong. She manipulated him and others to boost her image. That's really hurtful, and it's understandable that he felt betrayed. However, the author's response was to sabotage her award nomination. Even if her actions were malicious, is it right for the author to retaliate by ruining her chances at an award? \n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were deceitful and hurtful. She took advantage of his vulnerability and feelings. The author's motivation was based on anger and pain from being manipulated. On the other hand, the author's actions had consequences: Beck's nomination was withdrawn, she cried, and the author became more ostracized. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Intentionally sabotaging someone's award, even if that person wronged you, is a form of retaliation. It's not addressing the issue in a constructive way. Instead of confronting Beck directly or seeking support, the author chose to undermine her in a way that caused her emotional distress. That's a harmful cycle of revenge. \n\nHowever, the author's actions might be seen as justified by some because Beck was the one who initiated the deception. The author was trying to correct the injustice done to him. But in ethical terms, retaliation usually isn't considered the right approach. It's important to consider the balance between justice and revenge. \n\nAlso, the author's history of being bullied and his emotional state might influence his judgment. He's been through a lot, which makes his actions more complex. But regardless of the circumstances, taking away someone's award isn't a solution. The proper course would be to address the deception through appropriate channels, not personal retaliation. \n\nSo, even though Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response of sabotaging the award is also problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
