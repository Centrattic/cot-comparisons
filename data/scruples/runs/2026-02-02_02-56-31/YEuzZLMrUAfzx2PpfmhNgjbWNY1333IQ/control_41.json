Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for preventing their classmate from winning an award by making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a crush on Beck, who used their feelings to boost her social media presence and win an award. Beck's friends told her that Beck was only being kind to the author temporarily to improve her image. The author then took action to stop Beck from winning the award, which led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn and her crying.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. Beck's actions were manipulative and deceitful. She used the author's vulnerability for her own benefit, which is clearly hurtful. The author discovered this and felt betrayed. The emotional impact on the author was significant\u2014tears, feeling ostracized, and a loss of trust. \n\nHowever, the author's response was to interfere with Beck's award nomination. The methods used included checking the nomination status, possibly spreading information, and getting others involved. The result was that Beck's nomination was withdrawn, and Beck is now crying. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while Beck's actions were wrong, retaliating by actively sabotaging her award could be seen as harmful. The author's actions might have caused Beck emotional distress. But the author's own history of bullying and the betrayal might influence how we view the situation. \n\nLegally, if the award process has rules about nominations, interfering could be a violation. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author was hurt and took matters into their own hands. However, causing someone else to cry because of a perceived wrongdoing might not be justified. \n\nBut considering the emotional manipulation Beck employed, some might argue that the author's actions were a form of self-defense or a way to expose the truth. However, the author's method of stopping Beck\u2014possibly spreading the truth or getting the committee involved\u2014might be seen as justified if it revealed the manipulation. Yet, making Beck cry as a result could still be considered harsh.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while Beck's actions were in the wrong, the author's response could be seen as disproportionate. The author's actions might have caused further harm to Beck, even if Beck was at fault. The author might not have considered other ways to address the situation, like discussing it directly or reporting the manipulation through proper channels without personal retaliation.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: Beck's manipulation is wrong, but the author's retaliation is also harmful. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author acted based on uncovering a lie and exposing it to the authorities, that might be different from outright sabotage. The key is whether the author's actions were a necessary response or an overreaction.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, even if someone is wronged, retaliating in a way that harms others is still considered wrong. So even if Beck was manipulative, the author's actions caused emotional harm to Beck. Therefore, the author might still be in the wrong for taking it upon themselves to stop Beck's award, regardless of Beck's actions. \n\nAlternatively, if the author merely informed the committee of the truth, which led to the nomination being withdrawn, that's different from actively sabotaging. But the description says the author \"purposely stopped\" Beck, which might imply more active interference. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while perhaps understandable given the betrayal, are ethically questionable because they involve harming another person in retaliation. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). But there's a strong argument that Beck's behavior was worse. However, the question is about the author's actions specifically. Since the author caused harm to Beck, even if justified by the situation, it's a matter of whether the ends justify the means. In most cases, the answer would be A.\n"
