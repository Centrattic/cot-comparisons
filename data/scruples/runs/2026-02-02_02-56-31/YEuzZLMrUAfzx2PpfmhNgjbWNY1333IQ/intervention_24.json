  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The user, let's call them Person A, had a crush on Beck and went through a lot to ask her out. Beck accepted, but then her friend told Person A that Beck was using them for social media clout and a college award. So, Person A decided to stop Beck from winning the award, leading Beck to cry and now Person A is being ostracized. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. Beck was supposedly manipulating Person A for her own benefit. Person A found out through her friend and then took action to stop her nomination. The question is whether Person A was justified in their actions.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, taking deliberate actions to sabotage someone, even if they're being manipulative, could be considered wrong. However, there's a context where Person A was hurt and felt used. But does that justify the revenge? \n\nIn many cases, people might say that even if Beck was in the wrong, Person A's response was also inappropriate. Sabotaging someone's award chances by interfering with the committee might be seen as unethical, regardless of the reason. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Beck is a factor. If Beck is crying and the award was withdrawn, that's a consequence of Person A's actions. Even if Beck was using Person A, the retaliation could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nMoreover, the user mentions being a victim of bullying because of their scars, which adds a layer of vulnerability. But does that excuse their actions? Probably not. Everyone makes mistakes, and responding with sabotage might not be the right way to handle hurt feelings.\n\nThe school environment is also affected. Now Person A is ostracized, which is a consequence they might not have anticipated. People might be taking sides, but from an ethical perspective, both parties might have some responsibility here. Beck for manipulating, Person A for retaliating.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if Beck was being manipulative, Person A's actions were harmful. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because sabotaging someone's award is a serious action, regardless of the motive. However, some might argue that Beck's actions were worse. But generally, taking revenge in such a way is not considered acceptable.\n"
