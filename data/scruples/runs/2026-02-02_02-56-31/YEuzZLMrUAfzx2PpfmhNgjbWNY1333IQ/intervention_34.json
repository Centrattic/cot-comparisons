  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they did the right thing by stopping their classmate from winning an award after she manipulated their feelings. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe user, who has a history of bullying due to facial scars, had a crush on Beck. Beck used the user's feelings to build her social media image for a college application award. The user discovered this through a friend, felt betrayed, and took action to have Beck's nomination withdrawn, leading Beck to cry and the user being ostracized.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Manipulating someone's emotions for personal gain is definitely wrong. Beck's actions were deceitful and hurtful. However, the user's response was to sabotage Beck's award chances. While Beck's actions were inconsiderate, retaliating by interfering with her award could be seen as taking justice into their own hands. \n\nLegally, if the award was based on false pretenses, the committee might have grounds to withdraw the nomination. But the user didn't go through proper channels; instead, they used personal knowledge to influence the outcome. This could be unethical because it's about exposing the truth, but the method might be questionable. Also, the user's actions led to Beck's emotional distress, which adds to the complexity.\n\nThe user's intent was to seek justice for being manipulated, but the method might not be the right approach. It's important to address the manipulation through appropriate avenues rather than personal retaliation. The user's history of bullying might explain their anger, but that doesn't justify illegal or unethical actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck was in the wrong, the user's actions, though understandable in their frustration, were not the correct way to handle the situation. They should have reported the manipulation to the relevant authorities instead of taking matters into their own hands. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
