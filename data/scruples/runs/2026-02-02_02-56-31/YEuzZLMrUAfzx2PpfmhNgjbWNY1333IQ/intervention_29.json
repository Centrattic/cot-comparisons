  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe user is 17 and has been dealing with bullying because of facial scars from an accident. They had a crush on a classmate named Beck. They went out on a date, and for a week, Beck was kind to them. But then they found out that Beck was only being nice to get a \"positive role model\" award for her college application. The user was really hurt and went to stop Beck from winning the award, which led to Beck crying and the user getting more ostracized.\n\nSo the main question is, did the user do something wrong by stopping Beck from winning the award? Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, Beck used the user for her own benefit. She pretended to be kind, maybe even manipulative, to get an award. The user felt betrayed. But how does that justify making Beck cry and ruining her chances? The user's actions seem retaliatory. Even though Beck's actions were wrong, intentionally sabotaging her award and causing emotional harm is also wrong.\n\nBut wait, the user was hurt and felt manipulated. They might be justified in their feelings, but taking matters into their own hands by withdrawing the nomination? That's a problem. The award is probably supposed to recognize genuine actions, so if Beck was faking it, the award might be undeserved. But does that mean the user has the right to interfere? Probably not. The proper way would be to report it to the authorities or let the committee handle it.\n\nAlso, the user's actions led to Beck crying and the user becoming more ostracized. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the user's response is harmful. Revenge isn't a good solution. It's understandable to feel hurt, but the way the user handled it is unethical and possibly unethical. So the answer might be A, the user is in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, Beck's actions were manipulative and fake, which is really bad. The user was a victim of emotional manipulation. But even so, causing harm to Beck isn't the right response. The user should have trusted the system to handle the award process, or maybe talked to a teacher or authority figure. Taking direct action to sabotage someone else's award is not the right approach, no matter how hurt you are.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the user is in the wrong (A) because they took retaliatory actions that harmed another person, even if the other person was wrong. The correct approach would be to address the issue through proper channels, not personal revenge.\n"
