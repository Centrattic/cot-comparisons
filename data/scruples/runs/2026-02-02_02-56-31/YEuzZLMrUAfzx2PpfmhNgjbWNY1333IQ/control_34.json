Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who has been bullied due to facial scars, had a crush on a classmate named Beck. He went to great lengths to ask her out, and she accepted. However, he found out that she was using him for her own gain\u2014specifically, to get a \"positive role model\" award by pretending to be kind to someone she considered ugly. Upset, he intentionally stopped her from winning the award, leading her to cry and now facing more ostracism.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. Beck manipulated the author's feelings for her own benefit, which is definitely wrong. She used him to boost her image, which is selfish and harmful. However, the author's response was to sabotage her award. Even if her actions were unethical, does that justify the author's retaliation?\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. Beck's actions were deceitful, but the author's response involved going to authorities to withdraw her nomination. Is this a justifiable act of revenge or a separate wrongdoing? If the author lied or provided false information to get her nomination removed, that's definitely wrong. However, if he simply informed the committee of her manipulation, which was true, then maybe he's exposing her deceit. But even then, the method of doing it\u2014using personal grievances to influence an award\u2014could be problematic. \n\nThe author's motivation is important. He was hurt and seeking justice, but his actions caused harm to Beck and himself. Even if Beck was in the wrong, sabotaging her award might not be the right approach. The author could have reported her actions through proper channels without personal involvement. Instead, he took it upon himself, leading to more issues. \n\nAlso, considering the consequences, the author is now more ostracized. His actions might have been a form of revenge rather than a fair resolution. While Beck's manipulation is condemnable, the author's retaliation crosses into unethical behavior by undermining the award process. The correct approach would have been to address the manipulation through appropriate means, like talking to her or authorities, without directly causing her to lose the award. \n\nTherefore, even though Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response was also inappropriate. He should have handled it in a way that doesn't involve sabotaging someone else's chances, regardless of their faults. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
