Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck, spent time and effort to get close to her. Beck was only being nice because she wanted to win an award, which is for her college application. The author found out through a friend that Beck had manipulative intentions. Then the author went to the authorities to get Beck's nomination withdrawn, leading Beck to cry and the author facing more ostracism.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, Beck used the author for her own gain, which is wrong. On the other hand, the author took matters into their own hands by contacting the authorities. Normally, if someone is being manipulated or lied to, they have a right to feel hurt. But the author's response was to sabotage Beck's award, which could be seen as revenge. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's method of exposing the truth might be the right way, but intentionally making someone cry could be considered harsh. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they were already dealing with bullying due to their appearance. This adds context about their vulnerability. However, the author's actions might have caused Beck unnecessary distress. The award might have been based on false claims, so the author could be standing up for themselves. But is it their place to decide Beck's award fate? Maybe they should have reported the falsified information through proper channels rather than directly causing her nomination to be withdrawn. \n\nIf the committee withdrew the nomination upon learning the truth, then maybe the author's role in that process was a necessary step to correct a wrong. However, the emotional impact on Beck is a factor. The author might have acted out of hurt and frustration, which is understandable, but the method might not be justified. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author was wronged by Beck, but their retaliation could be seen as overstepping. The correct action would be to report the false information to the committee, but the author might have done that. However, if the committee acted on their own after the author provided evidence, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author took direct action to remove the nomination, that could be problematic. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's actions might be seen as justified in exposing the manipulation, but the emotional consequences on Beck could still mean the author is partly at fault. However, given Beck's initial deceit, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer is tricky, but leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they took personal revenge, even if their motives were hurt. But if they reported the truth through proper channels, maybe it's B. The key is whether the author's actions were a justified response to being deceived. Since the author's actions led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn, which might have been the right outcome if the nomination was based on lies, then maybe it's B. But the act of making Beck cry and facing more ostracism might mean the author is in the wrong. Hmm, this is really a tough one. I think the answer is A because the author's retaliation was harsh and personal, even if Beck was in the wrong. They could have addressed it without making Beck cry. So A for yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
