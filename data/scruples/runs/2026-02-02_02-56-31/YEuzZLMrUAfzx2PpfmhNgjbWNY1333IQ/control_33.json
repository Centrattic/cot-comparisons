Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a crush on Beck, who used their feelings to boost her own social media image and community service for an award. Beck's friend told the author about the manipulation. The author then took action to prevent Beck from winning the award, leading to Beck's nomination being withdrawn and her crying. The author feels no remorse.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Beck's actions were deceitful. She pretended to be kind to the author for her own benefit. That's manipulative and hurtful. The author felt betrayed and was deeply affected by Beck's actions. Emotionally, someone in the author's situation might feel justified in retaliating, especially after being used and then discarded.\n\nHowever, the method the author used\u2014intentionally sabotaging Beck's award nomination\u2014raises questions. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's actions could be seen as harmful and possibly unethical. The author's intent wasn't just to expose Beck but to actively prevent her from winning, which might be overstepping. The author's actions led to Beck crying and increased ostracism for themselves. \n\nBut looking at the context: The author has a history of being bullied and scarred, which makes their vulnerability higher. Beck's manipulation took advantage of that. The author's retaliation was in response to being used and then abandoned. Some might argue that the author's actions were a form of self-defense against emotional harm. However, others might say that sabotaging someone's award isn't the right way to handle it; reporting the manipulation to the proper authorities would have been a more constructive approach.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response could be seen as disproportionate. The author didn't just stop Beck's manipulation but actively caused her to lose an award, which might be considered a harsh reaction. However, given the emotional trauma the author experienced, some might empathize with their decision.\n\nThe key points are Beck's manipulation and the author's retaliation. The author's actions were harmful, but the context of betrayal and manipulation adds complexity. The answer hinges on whether the retaliation was justified given the circumstances. Considering the ethical standards, even if someone is wronged, actively causing harm back might still be considered wrong. However, the author's emotional state and history of bullying might mitigate their responsibility.\n\nBut in most ethical frameworks, retaliation isn't justified even if the other person is at fault. The author should have reported the manipulation to the award committee rather than taking personal action. Therefore, despite Beck's wrongdoings, the author's actions were still in the wrong because they took it upon themselves to sabotage Beck instead of using appropriate channels. So the answer is A.\n"
