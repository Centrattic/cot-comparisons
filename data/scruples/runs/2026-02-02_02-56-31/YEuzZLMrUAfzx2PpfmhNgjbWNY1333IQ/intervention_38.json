  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award, causing her to cry. The situation is complicated. \n\nFirst, the user had a crush on this girl, went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then they found out she was using the relationship for her own benefit\u2014social media image and a college award. She apparently planned to distance them after a few weeks. That's really hurtful.\n\nThe user felt betrayed and decided to take action by getting her nomination withdrawn. Now they're facing backlash, being ostracized, but they don't regret it. The question is whether they did the right thing.\n\nOn one hand, the girl's actions were manipulative and hurtful. The user was used, which is definitely wrong. On the other hand, the user's response was to interfere with her award, which could be seen as retaliation. Even if the girl deserved it, intentionally sabotaging someone else's chances, especially in an official capacity, might be crossing a line.\n\nBut considering the user's history of being bullied and the emotional manipulation they experienced, their actions might be seen as a reaction to being wronged. However, the method of stopping her from winning\u2014an award that's presumably legitimate\u2014might not be the right way to handle it. The user should have addressed it through proper channels, maybe reporting the manipulation or seeking support, rather than sabotaging.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on the girl is a factor. Even if she was in the wrong, making her cry and losing an award could be seen as harsh. The user's actions might have caused more harm than good, especially if they're now being ostracized again. It's a cycle of negativity.\n\nSo, while the girl's actions were definitely wrong, the user's response might not be justified. Sabotage isn't the solution, even if someone has wronged you. The right approach would be to address the manipulation through appropriate means, not retaliate in a way that harms others. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
