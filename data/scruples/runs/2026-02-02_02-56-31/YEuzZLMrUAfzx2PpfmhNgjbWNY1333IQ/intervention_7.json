  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the person is 17 and has had a tough time with bullying because of their appearance. They had a crush on someone named Beck, who they thought was genuinely nice. They made a big effort to ask her out, which shows a lot of effort and emotional investment. Then, they found out that Beck was using them for a social media image to win an award called 'positive role model' for her college application. She had friends pretend to be nice to him and then distance themselves after March.\n\nThe person felt betrayed and decided to take action. They checked the award's nominations and found Beck's name. Then, with help from friends and family as alibis, they somehow had her nomination withdrawn. Beck is now crying, and the person feels no remorse, even though they're now more ostracized.\n\nSo, the question is whether the person is in the wrong. On one hand, Beck used the person's feelings for her own gain, which is definitely hurtful and unethical. The person felt they were being manipulated and then discarded. On the other hand, the person took actions that directly affected Beck's chances at the award, which might be considered sabotage. They admitted to purposefully stopping her from winning, leading to her crying and likely other consequences.\n\nThe key points here are intent and method. Beck's actions were deceitful and harmful, but the person's response was to retaliate in a way that could be seen as vengeful. Even though they had a good reason, sabotaging someone's award nomination isn't a typical or legal way to handle betrayal. The person might not be the one in the wrong entirely, but they did take it upon themselves to cause harm in return. The answer might depend on cultural or moral views on revenge versus justice. However, in most ethical frameworks, taking matters into one's own hands like that is generally frowned upon, even if the other person was wrong. So, the person is in the wrong because their actions were intentional sabotage, even if the motive was justified.\n"
