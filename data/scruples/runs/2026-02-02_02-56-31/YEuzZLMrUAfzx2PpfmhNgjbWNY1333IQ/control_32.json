Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author, let's call them Person X, had a crush on a classmate named Beck. They went through a lot of effort to ask her out, and things seemed to go well. However, Beck's friend revealed that Beck had been manipulating her friends to be kind to Person X for a short time to win a \"positive role model\" award for her college application. Beck's intention was to boost her image, and she didn't genuinely care for Person X's feelings. \n\nPerson X discovered this and decided to take action by contacting the award committee to have Beck's nomination withdrawn. As a result, Beck's nomination was taken off, and Beck is now upset. Person X feels justified because they were hurt and manipulated, and now they're facing ostracism but have no remorse.\n\nNow, the key points to consider here are:\n1. **Consent and Deception**: Beck manipulated her friends and used Person X's feelings for her own gain. This is a form of emotional manipulation and deceit.\n2. **Intentions of Person X**: Person X's actions were a direct response to being wronged. They felt betrayed and took steps to retaliate, which led to the withdrawal of Beck's nomination.\n3. **Ethical Implications**: While Beck's actions were unethical, Person X's retaliation involved contacting the committee without perhaps understanding the full consequences. Was it right to take such an action?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while Beck's actions are clearly wrong, Person X's response might be considered a form of vigilantism. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Person X acted out of hurt and anger, which is understandable, but they also caused harm to Beck by invalidating her award. \n\nHowever, Beck's manipulation was a violation of trust and possibly a form of emotional abuse. Person X might argue that they were protecting themselves from further harm and exposing Beck's deceit. But in doing so, Person X might have overstepped by interfering with Beck's award. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the principle of \"do no harm\" is important. Person X's actions harmed Beck's opportunities, which could be seen as wrong, regardless of Beck's actions. However, if Beck's nomination was based on false pretenses, then Person X's action might be seen as exposing a lie, which could be justified.\n\nAnother angle is the intention behind the actions. Beck's intent was self-serving and exploitative. Person X's intent was to correct an injustice they faced. The consequences for Person X (being ostracized) versus the consequences for Beck (losing the award) need to be weighed. \n\nIn terms of legal and moral standards, even if Beck was in the wrong, Person X's method of confronting the issue might not be the appropriate way. The correct approach would be to report the unethical behavior through proper channels, not to take personal action that could be seen as defaming Beck's application.\n\nSo, while Beck's actions are clearly wrong, Person X's method of retaliation might not be the morally correct response. Therefore, Person X might be in the wrong for taking direct action against Beck's nomination instead of seeking a more constructive resolution.\n"
