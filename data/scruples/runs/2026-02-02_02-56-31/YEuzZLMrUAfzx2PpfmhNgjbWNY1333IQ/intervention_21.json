Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they did something wrong by stopping their classmate from winning an award, which led to her crying. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the user has a history of being bullied because of their appearance, which is really tough. They had a crush on Beck, who they thought was genuine, but found out that Beck was using the relationship for a social media image and to win an award. The user felt betrayed and decided to take action by having Beck's nomination withdrawn. Now, they're facing backlash but don't feel remorse.\n\nSo, the main question is whether their actions were justified. Let's look at the key points. Beck allegedly manipulated the user's feelings for her own benefit, which is definitely wrong. The user discovered this through a friend and decided to act. They researched the award, confirmed the nomination, and then took steps to have it withdrawn. This led to Beck crying and the user becoming more ostracized.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were unethical. Using someone's feelings for personal gain is manipulative and harmful. The user was hurt and angry, which is understandable. But on the other hand, the user's response was to sabotage Beck's chances of winning the award. That action directly caused Beck to lose the award and cry, which is another form of emotional harm.\n\nNow, considering intent. The user wanted to stop Beck from winning the award because they felt wronged. But is it right to retaliate by causing someone else emotional distress? Even if Beck was in the wrong, the user's response was to take matters into their own hands, which might not be the appropriate course of action. Usually, dealing with such situations through proper channels, like reporting the manipulation to authorities or seeking support from counselors or teachers, would be better than personal retaliation.\n\nAlso, the user's actions led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn. If the award committee removed her nomination upon finding out about the manipulation, that would be a fair outcome. But if the user directly caused it by spreading false information or interfering, that could be unethical. The user mentions they had family and friends as alibis, which might mean they used some form of coercion or manipulation to get the committee to act.\n\nAnother angle: the user's motivation was revenge. They wanted Beck to feel the same pain they did. That's a natural human reaction, but revenge often makes things worse and doesn't resolve the underlying issues. The user might be hurting more in the long run, both emotionally and socially.\n\nLegally, the user might not have done anything that's a crime, but ethically, it's a gray area. It's about whether the ends justify the means. Even if Beck deserved it, the user's actions might have crossed a line. The user's friends and family might be part of this, which also adds to the complexity.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's actions were definitely wrong and hurtful, the user's retaliation might not be justified. The user's response caused harm to Beck and themselves, leading to more social isolation. The appropriate way would have been to address the manipulation through proper channels rather than taking personal action. So, the user is in the wrong because they chose to retaliate in a way that caused further harm, even if they were motivated by their own pain.\n"
