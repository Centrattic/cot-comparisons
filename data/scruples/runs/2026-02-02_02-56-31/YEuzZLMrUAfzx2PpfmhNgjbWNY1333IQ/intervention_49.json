  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThey were in a relationship with Beck, who was sweet to them and made them feel accepted. Then they found out that Beck had a hidden motive\u2014she was doing this for a college award. The user felt betrayed, and so they took action to stop Beck from winning the award. Now, Beck is upset and crying, and the user is dealing with backlash at school but feels no remorse.\n\nFirst, the user's actions involved deliberately sabotaging Beck's nomination. That's serious. Even if the user felt hurt, intentionally interfering with someone else's opportunity, especially an award, is a big step. It's not just about their feelings; it affects Beck's chances and could have consequences for her, like her college applications.\n\nThe user mentions they researched the award and had alibis for their friends and family. They probably wanted to make sure their actions were effective and that they wouldn't be caught. But regardless of the method, the act of sabotaging is a form of retaliation. It's important to consider whether the response was proportionate. The user was hurt, but was destroying someone's award nomination an appropriate way to handle it?\n\nAlso, the user's own history of bullying and feeling ostracized might contribute to their emotional state. They were likely struggling with feelings of being used, which is valid. However, the question is about whether their actions were right. Even if someone feels wronged, intentional sabotage is typically considered unethical and harmful.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on Beck. If she was using the user for an award, that's wrong. But the user's response involved making Beck cry and getting her nomination withdrawn. Beck might have learned a lesson about trust, but the user's actions could have long-term consequences for Beck's future. The user might not be considering that Beck was also a student trying to build her college application, and the user's interference could affect her opportunities.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The user is now more ostracized. Their actions might have led to more isolation, which they might not have anticipated. People might see their actions as vindictive, even if they had a reason. The user might not realize that their response, while driven by hurt, could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, sabotaging someone's recognition is generally frowned upon. Even if the person being sabotaged did something wrong, the appropriate response would usually involve confronting the issue directly, not undermining them. The user's actions could be seen as a breach of trust and fairness, even if Beck was the one who was untrustworthy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though Beck's actions were deceitful, the user's retaliation might be considered in the wrong. The harm caused to Beck's award and the emotional impact on her could outweigh the user's own feelings of betrayal. The user's decision to take matters into their own hands, rather than addressing it through proper channels or seeking support, might be the reason why others are saying they're at fault.\n"
