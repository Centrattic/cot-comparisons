Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who has some facial scars and has been bullied, had a crush on a girl named Beck. He went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then he found out that she was using him for her own gain\u2014specifically, to get a \"positive role model\" award by pretending to be kind to him. He got really upset and decided to stop her from winning the award, which made her cry. Now people are saying he's in the wrong, and he's confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of Beck. She allegedly pretended to be nice to the author to boost her own image for an award. That's manipulative and hurtful. She used his feelings for her own benefit, which is definitely wrong. The author felt betrayed and hurt, which is understandable.\n\nThen, the author's response: he researched the award, checked the nominations, and somehow got her name removed. He has no remorse and feels satisfied. But the problem is how he went about stopping her. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author took matters into his own hands, which could be seen as interfering improperly. Did he have the right to do that? If he contacted the committee or spread information that wasn't true, that could be problematic. However, if he simply provided truthful information that she was being inauthentic, maybe it's a different story. The key here is whether his actions were ethical or if he crossed a line.\n\nThe author was already ostracized and had a hard time, so his actions might have been driven by hurt and anger. But taking revenge by undermining someone else's award, even if they were manipulative, can be seen as wrong because it's a form of retaliation. The consequences were that Beck ended up crying and he became more ostracized. \n\nIn terms of morality, while Beck's actions were despicable, the author's response might not be justified. It's important to address harm without causing more harm. However, the line is blurry. If Beck's nomination was based on false pretenses, exposing that might be right. But if the author used deception or unethical methods to remove her name, that's wrong. The story doesn't specify if he used unethical means, just that he \"went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friends and family as alibi.\" Maybe he provided truthful information that she was being inauthentic, which could be a legitimate action. But maybe not.\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The author was deeply hurt and vulnerable. But even so, retaliation isn't usually considered acceptable. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he did something unethical to sabotage her, then yes. If he simply reported her for genuine misconduct, maybe not. However, the way he framed it as \"pursposely stopping her from winning\" sounds like sabotage. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on the methods used. Since the details are a bit vague, but the act of interfering in an award process is generally not advised. So probably the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he took revenge instead of addressing it through proper channels, causing harm to her and himself.\n"
