Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is complicated, so I need to analyze it step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they stopped their classmate, Beck, from winning an award by providing evidence to the committee that her nomination should be withdrawn. The key here is understanding Beck's actions. According to the author, Beck was pretending to be kind and accepting of them, but in reality, she was using the author for her own gain\u2014specifically, to boost her image for a college award. Beck's friends were part of this act, and it was all a setup to collect community service hours for the award.\n\nThe author felt manipulated and used. After discovering this, they took action to expose Beck's deceit. The result was that Beck's nomination was withdrawn, and she cried as a result. The author now faces social backlash but feels justified because of how they were treated.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Beck's actions were unethical\u2014manipulating someone's feelings for personal gain. The author had the right to feel betrayed and seek some form of justice or retribution. However, the method they used involved actively sabotaging Beck's nomination. Even if Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response could be seen as revenge. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author obtained evidence of the fraud and presented it to the authorities. If Beck was indeed being nominated based on false information (pretending to help someone when it was a setup), then the author providing proof to the committee could be seen as exposing a lie. In that case, the author might be acting in the right, as they corrected a false nomination. However, the emotional aspect complicates things. The author's motivation was personal hurt, which might cloud the moral judgment of their actions. \n\nThe key factors are:\n1. Beck's deceitful behavior.\n2. The author's response was to uncover the truth and report it, which is generally right.\n3. However, the author's primary motivation was personal revenge, not just exposing the truth for the award's integrity.\n\nIf Beck's nomination was based on falsified community service, then the author's action might be justified. But if the award committee would have discovered the fraud on their own, the author's interference could be seen as unnecessary. However, the author's emotional state and the betrayal they felt must also be considered. They acted out of a sense of injustice and to correct a wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, even if Beck was acting in bad faith, the author's method of stopping her could be seen as harsh. The consequences for Beck (losing the award and crying) might be considered excessive, especially if the author's intent was to get back at her. The author might have other means to address the emotional hurt without involving a public sabotage that could affect Beck's college application.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response involved taking action that could be seen as vengeful. Even if the truth was exposed, the method used might be in question. The line between justice and revenge is thin here. However, if the author provided factual evidence of a fraudulent nomination, it's possible their action was a legitimate way to correct the situation, but their personal motivation complicates this. The answer might depend on the specifics of the award's rules and whether the author's actions were in line with those procedures.\n"
