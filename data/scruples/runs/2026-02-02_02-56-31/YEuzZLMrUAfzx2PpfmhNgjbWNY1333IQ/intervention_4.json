  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they were wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award after she used them for her own benefit. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user had a crush on Beck and went through a lot to ask her out. They felt accepted and happy for a while. Then Beck's friend told them that Beck was using them for her college application by pretending to be kind and then planned to distance herself. The user, feeling betrayed, took action to remove Beck from the awards, which led to Beck crying and the user becoming more ostracized.\n\nSo the main question is whether the user did the right thing. On one hand, Beck manipulated the user's feelings for her own gain, which is really hurtful. The user was already dealing with bullying and self-esteem issues, so being used must have been devastating. On the other hand, the user took a direct action that affected Beck's chances at an award, which could be seen as retaliatory and maybe even crossing a line. \n\nBut let's consider the context. The user was in a vulnerable position, having been bullied and scarred, and then being used. Their actions were a response to being manipulated. However, the method they used\u2014contacting authorities, getting others involved\u2014might have been unethical or inappropriate. Even if Beck deserved it, intentionally sabotaging someone else's award could be seen as harmful. \n\nBut wait, the user's motivation was based on being wronged. They weren't just being vindictive; they were hurt and wanted to stop Beck from getting an award she didn't truly deserve. However, the means of stopping her might have been inappropriate. The user might not have gone through proper channels or considered the consequences beyond Beck's reaction.\n\nAlso, the result was that Beck was devastated and the user's social situation worsened. Even if the user feels justified, their actions could have long-term consequences for both parties. The user might have acted out of pain, but does that justify their actions? It's a tough call. \n\nIn terms of ethics, retaliating by undermining someone else's achievements could be seen as wrong, regardless of the reasons. However, the initial betrayal by Beck was severe. It's a balance between justice and the method used. The user might not be entirely in the wrong because they were reacting to being manipulated, but their actions were harmful and possibly unethical. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because the method of stopping Beck was inappropriate, even if the motivation was understandable. However, some might argue that Beck's actions were worse. The user's actions caused harm, so it's likely A.\n"
