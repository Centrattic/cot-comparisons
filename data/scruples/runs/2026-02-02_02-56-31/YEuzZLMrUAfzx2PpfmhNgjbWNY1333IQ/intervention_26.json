Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user, who's been through some bullying due to their scars, had a crush on a girl named Beck. They spent time getting to know her, even went on a date, and things were going well. But then the user found out that Beck was using them for a \"positive role model\" award for her college applications. She had her friends be nice to the user for a while, then planned to distance them after March. The user then took action to stop her from winning the award, which led to Beck crying and the user being ostracized.\n\nHmm, so the user's actions were deliberate. They researched the award, confirmed her nomination, and had people verify their alibi before causing her nomination to be withdrawn. The user admits to doing this on purpose and feels no remorse. Now, the user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ethical aspect. Deliberately sabotaging someone's award nomination is generally considered wrong. Even if the person being targeted did something manipulative, intentionally causing harm in return is a form of retaliation. The user might feel justified because they were hurt, but revenge often doesn't make the action right.\n\nSecond, the consequences: Beck ended up crying and her nomination was withdrawn, which might have affected her college applications. The user, on the other hand, is now more ostracized. But the user feels satisfied, which complicates things. However, the user's actions could be seen as a breach of trust or even a violation of the award's rules if they falsified information or spread lies.\n\nBut wait, the user's friend or family had an alibi? Did they do something like report Beck's manipulation to the committee, or did they actively work against her? If they provided truthful information that led to Beck's nomination being rescinded, maybe there's a case for it being justified. But if they lied or spread false information, that's definitely wrong.\n\nThe user mentions that Beck was using them for an award, which makes her actions inconsiderate and manipulative. However, that doesn't necessarily give the user the right to retaliate. The appropriate response might have been to confront Beck, report the situation to the award committee, or seek support from others without taking action that harms Beck's chances.\n\nIn terms of emotional harm, Beck's actions were hurtful, but the user's response caused her further distress. The user's motivation was personal satisfaction, which is a red flag. Acting out of revenge, even if the initial harm was real, isn't typically considered morally justified. It's important to resolve conflicts through ethical means rather than personal retaliation.\n\nConsidering all that, even though Beck's behavior was exploitative, the user's decision to sabotage her award was a deliberate act of revenge. That makes the user at fault here. So the answer would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
