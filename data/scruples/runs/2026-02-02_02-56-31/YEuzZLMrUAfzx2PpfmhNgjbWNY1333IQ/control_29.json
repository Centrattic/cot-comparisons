Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by stopping their classmate from winning an award, leading her to cry. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck and went through a lot to ask her out. They felt accepted and happy, but then found out Beck was using them for her own benefit\u2014posting things on social media to boost her image for an award. The author discovered this through a friend, got angry, and took action by having the award nomination withdrawn. Now, Beck is crying, and the author feels ostracized but has no remorse.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Beck's actions were manipulative. She pretended to be kind and interested in the author but was actually using them for her college application. That's definitely unethical. However, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's award chances. The author didn't confront Beck directly or report the manipulation to the school in a formal way. Instead, they took it upon themselves to remove Beck's nomination, possibly through some underhanded methods (like getting the committee to withdraw it, with alibis from friends and family). \n\nThe problem here is that the author's actions were revengeful. Even though Beck was in the wrong, the author's method of retaliation might have crossed a line. Sabotaging someone else's award nomination could be considered unethical or even a violation of school policies. The author might have used misleading information or manipulated the process to get Beck's nomination removed. This could harm Beck's chances unfairly, even if she did act wrongly.\n\nOn the other hand, Beck's actions were manipulative and deceitful. She used the author's feelings for her own gain, which is hurtful and exploitative. The author felt betrayed and hurt, which is understandable. However, taking matters into their own hands doesn't make the action right. The proper course would be to address the situation through appropriate channels, like talking to a counselor or reporting the manipulation formally. \n\nThe author might feel justified because Beck was the one who started the deceit, but the method of response was not appropriate. The author's actions led to Beck crying and being ostracized, which is a negative outcome. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's retaliation could be seen as a form of bullying or revenge, which is also wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though Beck's actions were bad, the author's response was not the right way to handle it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
