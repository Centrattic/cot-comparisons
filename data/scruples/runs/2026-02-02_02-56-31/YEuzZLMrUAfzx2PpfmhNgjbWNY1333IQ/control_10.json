Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author did the right thing by stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation is pretty complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of being bullied due to facial scars from an accident. They had a crush on Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and initially had a good time. But then Beck's friend revealed that Beck was using the relationship to boost her social media image for a college award. The author felt betrayed, found out about the award nomination, and then took action to have her nomination withdrawn, leading Beck to cry and the author facing more ostracism.\n\nNow, the key points here are deception and retaliation. Beck supposedly manipulated the author's feelings for her own gain, which is definitely wrong. However, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's award nomination. The question is whether this retaliation makes the author wrong.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were unethical and hurtful. She used someone's genuine feelings for her own benefit, which is manipulative. On the other hand, the author took it upon themselves to take down Beck's nomination without going through proper channels. Even if Beck's intentions were bad, the author's method of stopping her\u2014possibly through spreading information or other means\u2014could be considered unethical as well. It's a form of revenge, which might not be justified even if the original action was wrong.\n\nAlso, consider the consequences. The author is now more ostracized and faces more backlash. But they feel no remorse, which might indicate that their actions were impulsive or not well-thought-out. While Beck's actions were hurtful, does that justify the author's actions? It's a gray area. In a way, the author is taking justice into their own hands, which isn't advisable. The appropriate course might have been to report Beck's behavior to the authorities through the proper channels instead of directly meddling with the award nomination.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on Beck. She was crying, which shows she was affected, but her initial actions were harmful. However, the author's actions might have violated privacy or ethical boundaries. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, both parties made mistakes. Beck manipulated a relationship, and the author retaliated in a way that might be considered unethical. So, while Beck's actions are clearly wrong, the author's retaliation might still be considered wrong because it's not a sanctioned form of justice. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
