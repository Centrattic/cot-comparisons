Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a crush on a girl named Beck, they started dating, but then Beck's friend told the author that Beck was only being nice to him to win an award. Beck was using the author's feelings to boost her social media image and college applications. The author then took action to stop Beck from winning the award, which made her cry. Now the author is being criticized for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Beck's actions. If she was intentionally manipulating the author's feelings for her own benefit, that's pretty unethical. Using someone's emotions for personal gain is wrong. But then the author's response was to sabotage her award. Even if Beck was in the wrong, does that justify the author's actions?\n\nThe author took steps to have Beck's nomination withdrawn. That could be considered unethical or even a violation of school policies. The author might have spread information or contacted the committee behind the scenes. While Beck's actions were hurtful, the author's retaliation could be seen as going too far. It's a cycle of harm\u2014Beck used the author, and the author retaliated, causing Beck emotional distress.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were bullied and had scars, which adds context to their feelings of being treated unfairly. But does that excuse their actions? Maybe not. Retaliation isn't the healthiest or most constructive response. The author could have sought support from a counselor or authority figures to address the situation without taking matters into their own hands.\n\nHowever, Beck's manipulation was a betrayal. The author felt used, which is a valid emotion. But the method of dealing with it\u2014intentionally ruining Beck's chances for an award\u2014might be crossing a line. Even if Beck deserved it, the author's actions could have consequences for both parties. \n\nIn terms of ethics, most people would say that taking revenge is not the right approach. The author is now ostracized, which might be a consequence of their actions. The situation is complex, but the author's response seems to escalate the conflict rather than resolve it. Therefore, while Beck's actions were wrong, the author's retaliation likely makes them equally at fault.\n"
