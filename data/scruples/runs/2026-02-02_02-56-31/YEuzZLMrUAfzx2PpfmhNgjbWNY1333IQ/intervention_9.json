  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they did the wrong thing by intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award, which led to her crying. They were hurt because this girl they had a crush on used them for her own benefit, like for social media posts and college applications. The user then took action to\u64a4\u56de\u5979\u7684\u63d0\u540d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5979\u96be\u8fc7\u3002\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user had a crush on Beck, invested time and effort into the relationship, only to find out that Beck was using them for her own gain. That's definitely hurtful. The user felt manipulated and decided to retaliate by interfering with her award nomination. \n\nBut the question is whether the user is in the wrong. On one hand, Beck's actions were unethical and hurtful. She used the user's feelings for her own benefit, which is manipulative. On the other hand, the user took matters into their own hands, which might not be the right approach. \n\nLegally, if the award nomination was based on false or unethical criteria, maybe there's a case to report it through proper channels. But the user didn't go through official means; they probably sent a message directly to the committee, which could be seen as unethical or even illegal if they lied. \n\nEmotionally, the user was hurt, but retaliating by causing someone else to cry isn't a healthy resolution. It might lead to more harm, like the user becoming more ostracized. Also, taking revenge doesn't address the root issue and can create a cycle of negativity.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while Beck's actions were wrong, the user's response also harmed another person. Both actions are problematic, but the user's actions likely caused direct harm to Beck and their own social standing. \n\nConsidering the aftermath, the user now feels more isolated, which might not be the best outcome. The right approach might have been to confront Beck, set boundaries, and perhaps report the situation to authorities if there was unethical behavior in the award process. \n\nSo, even though Beck was at fault, the user's method of retaliation is questionable. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but their actions were still harmful. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since they took unethical steps to retaliate, the answer is likely A (yes, they are in the wrong), but the nuance is important.\n"
