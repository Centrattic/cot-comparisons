  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award after she manipulated them for her own benefit.\n\nFirst, the situation: Beck (the girl) pretended to be nice and even formed a relationship with the user to boost her social media image and win an award. The user found out, reported her, leading to her nomination being withdrawn. Now the user is facing backlash but feels justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception, emotional manipulation, and the user's retaliation. Beck's actions were clearly manipulative and hurtful. She used the user for her own gain, which is unethical. The user discovered this and took action to stop her from winning the award, which was based on false pretenses.\n\nBut the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Legally, if the award committee has a process to handle such nominations, maybe the user didn't follow the proper channels. But ethically, exposing someone who's lying to gain an award might be seen as the right thing to do. However, the method of stopping her\u2014maybe by reporting her\u2014is one thing, but if the user did something harmful beyond that, like spreading false information, it could be different. The user mentioned they confirmed with the authorities and had alibis, so maybe they used the right channels.\n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. The user was already dealing with bullying and self-esteem issues. Being manipulated and then retaliating might be seen as understandable, but intentionally making someone lose an award they didn't deserve could be justified. However, causing her to cry and facing ostracism might be considered harsh.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were wrong. On the other, the user's response might be seen as taking justice into their own hands. The user might not be in the wrong for exposing the truth, but the method and the consequences could be debatable. However, the user's actions prevented an undeserving person from winning an award, which could be seen as the right move.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Since Beck was the one who acted deceptively, the user might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that the user should have handled it through proper channels rather than directly intervening. But given the emotional impact Beck had on the user, maybe the user's actions are justified.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because Beck manipulated the user for her own gain, and the user corrected that by stopping her from getting an award based on a lie.\n"
