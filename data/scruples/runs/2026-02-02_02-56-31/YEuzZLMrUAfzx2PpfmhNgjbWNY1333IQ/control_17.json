Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author (let's call them Person A) had a crush on their classmate Beck. They went to a lot of effort to ask her out, and then their relationship seemed to blossom. However, Beck was using Person A for social media posts to boost her own image for a college award. The friend of Beck revealed this, and Person A then took action by stopping Beck from winning the award, leading Beck to cry and the author facing backlash.\n\nNow, the key points here. Beck's actions: she pretended to be kind to someone she saw as \"ugly\" to gain social media clout and a college award. That's manipulative and morally wrong. She used Person A's feelings for her own gain. That's definitely unethical and could be considered emotionally abusive.\n\nOn the other hand, Person A's response was to sabotage Beck's award nomination. They went to the authorities and had alibis, which suggests they took deliberate steps to ruin Beck's chances. Even though Beck's actions were wrong, Person A's retaliation involved direct interference in Beck's academic or extracurricular efforts, which could have serious consequences. \n\nBut here's the thing: Beck initiated the manipulation. She didn't respect Person A's feelings and used them. Person A, after being wronged, took matters into their own hands. However, the question is about whether Person A is in the wrong. \n\nLegally and ethically, even if Beck did something wrong, retaliating by undermining her award might be considered a form of revenge. It's not a legal action, but in a moral context, is it justified? The user is 17, which means they're a minor, and their actions might be seen as a response to emotional harm. \n\nThe community's reaction is that almost everyone says the author is wrong, but maybe they're not considering the manipulation Beck caused. However, the author's action caused harm to Beck as well, even if she deserved it. The line between justified self-defense and revenge is thin here. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, revenge is discouraged because it perpetuates a cycle of harm. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's action might not be the right response. However, considering the emotional context and the fact that Beck manipulated a vulnerable person, some might argue the author had a right to retaliate. \n\nBut the key is whether the author's actions were wrong. The act of interfering with the award process is a violation of the award's integrity, even if motivated by personal reasons. So ethically, the author might still be in the wrong because they didn't use appropriate channels (like reporting Beck's manipulation to authorities properly) but instead took direct action to hurt Beck. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while Beck's actions were despicable, the author's retaliation involved unethical behavior that caused harm, even if it was a response to that harm. However, there's a strong argument that Beck's manipulation was the root issue. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing, so their action to sabotage the award is problematic regardless of Beck's actions. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
