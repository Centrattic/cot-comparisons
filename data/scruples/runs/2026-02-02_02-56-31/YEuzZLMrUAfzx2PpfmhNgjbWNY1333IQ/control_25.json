Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a crush on a girl named Beck, went out with her, but then found out that Beck was using the author to build her social media image for a \"positive role model\" award. The author then took action to stop Beck from winning the award, leading to Beck crying and the author being ostracized.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author's actions were justified or not. Let's break it down. The author discovered that Beck was manipulating them for a college application award. That's pretty harsh. The author felt betrayed and used, which is understandable. But did they have the right to interfere with the award nomination?\n\nLegally, maybe not. The author went to the authorities and had their friend and family as alibis. That part sounds like they tried to report the truth, which might be ethical if the award was based on false information. But the method of stopping the nomination\u2014maybe the author sent messages or provided evidence to the committee? If they reported the truth, that's a different ballgame than sabotaging. But the way it's phrased, the author \"purposely stopping\" Beck from winning. If that involved lying or spreading false information, then it's wrong. But if they provided honest information that showed Beck's actions were insincere, maybe it's justified.\n\nEmotionally, the author was hurt. Being used like that can leave someone feeling angry and betrayed. The author's actions led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn. Beck cried because of that. The author now feels ostracized but has no remorse. \n\nThere's also the aspect of how the author handled it. Did they confront Beck first? The author says they found out through a friend of Beck's. Maybe Beck's actions were unethical, but the author's response could have been more mature. Like, confronting Beck, ending the relationship, and letting the award committee handle it through proper channels. Instead, the author took matters into their own hands, which might be seen as revenge rather than a justified action.\n\nAlso, the author's self-esteem issues due to their scars and past bullying might have played a role. They felt used, and the betrayal was more painful because they opened up and were accepted briefly. But does that excuse sabotaging someone else's award? Not necessarily. The line between standing up for oneself and taking vengeful action is thin here.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the award was based on false claims (like helping the author interact with friends when it was actually a setup), then the committee might have a responsibility to investigate. The author reporting this could be in line with holding the award process accountable. However, if the author acted out of anger without giving Beck a chance to explain or address it through proper channels, they might have overstepped.\n\nSo, considering all angles: Beck's manipulation is wrong, but the author's method of response could be problematic. The key is whether the author's actions were a justified report of unethical behavior or a vengeful act. The story doesn't clarify if the author provided evidence to the committee to check the validity of Beck's nomination or if they did something more underhanded. The answer might hinge on that. If the author simply informed the committee of the truth, maybe it's not their fault. But if they lied or spread rumors, they are at fault. The question says the author \"purposely stopping\" her from winning, which might imply intentional sabotage. Given that Beck's actions were unethical, the author's response could be seen as a form of justice, but it's still a gray area.\n\nBut in most moral frameworks, taking revenge isn't considered right, even if the person was wronged. The proper action would be to address the issue through the correct channels. The author might have a valid reason to feel wronged, but their method of dealing with it might be wrong. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they took matters into their own hands rather than letting the appropriate authorities handle it, leading to Beck's emotional distress.\n"
