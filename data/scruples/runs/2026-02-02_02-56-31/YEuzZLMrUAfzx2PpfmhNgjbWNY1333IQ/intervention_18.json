  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a crush on a classmate named Beck, who ended up accepting their friendship and even went out on a date. Then they found out that Beck was using their relationship for her own benefit to win an award, which made the person really upset. In response, they took action to stop her from winning the award, which resulted in Beck crying and the person now being ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. Beck's actions: she pretended to be kind and friendly, leading the person on, and then used the situation to boost her own image for an award. That's pretty underhanded. The person in question discovered this, got angry, and decided to take matters into their own hands by getting her nomination withdrawn. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the person is in the wrong for doing this. On one hand, Beck's behavior was manipulative and deceitful, which is definitely wrong. On the other hand, retaliating by interfering with her award nomination could be seen as unethical or even illegal, depending on how it was done. The person says they researched the award and used their friend and family as alibis, which might imply they took some steps to sabotage it. \n\nEthically, revenge can be a tricky area. Even if someone is wronged, taking direct action to harm them back might not be the right approach. However, the person might feel justified given the emotional hurt they experienced. But legally and morally, undermining an award nomination is a form of sabotage. It's important to consider whether the person used appropriate channels to address the situation. For example, reporting the manipulation to the award committee or seeking support from teachers or counselors. Instead, directly intervening could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the person's actions led to Beck crying, which is a negative outcome. Even if Beck was in the wrong, causing emotional harm to someone else isn't ideal. The person now feels ostracized, which they might have anticipated, but their lack of remorse raises questions about their justification.\n\nIn summary, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the person's response of sabotaging the award nomination is problematic. It's a form of retaliation that causes harm and doesn't address the issue constructively. Therefore, the person is in the wrong for their actions, even if they were motivated by feeling betrayed. The correct approach would have been to seek support through appropriate channels rather than taking direct action against Beck.\n"
