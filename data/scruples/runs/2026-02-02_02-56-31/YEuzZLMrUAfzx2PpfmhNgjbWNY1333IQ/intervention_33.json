  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a crush on this girl, Back, and after a nice time together, they found out she was using them for her own benefit to win an award. The person then took action to stop her from winning the award, which led to her crying and them facing more ostracism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The person was deeply hurt when they discovered that their relationship with Back was a setup for her to gain social media clout and an award. That's a lot of emotional pain. They felt betrayed, which is valid. But then they decided to take matters into their own hands by getting her nomination withdrawn. \n\nNow, the question is whether this was the right action. On one hand, revenge can be tempting when someone feels wronged, but it's important to consider the consequences. By withdrawing her nomination, the person is directly interfering with someone else's opportunity. Even if Back used them, stealing her award could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the fact that the person is facing more bullying now might indicate that their actions had unintended consequences. While they might feel justified in their actions because of how they were treated, using underhanded methods to retaliate could be seen as morally wrong. \n\nAnother angle is the method they used. They involved others (friends and family as alibis) and possibly spread information to get her nomination removed. This could be considered unethical or even a violation of rules if they lied or spread false information. \n\nHowever, the person's background of being bullied and scarred adds context. They've endured a lot, and this situation might have been a breaking point. But intent matters. Even if their intentions were to stop someone from exploiting them, the method of retaliation might not be the right approach. \n\nIn ethical terms, the principle of \"an eye for an eye\" often leads to more harm. Instead of confronting her directly or seeking support through appropriate channels, the person chose to undermine her, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, while the person's pain is understandable, their actions in retaliating might be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong). But there's also empathy for their situation.\n"
