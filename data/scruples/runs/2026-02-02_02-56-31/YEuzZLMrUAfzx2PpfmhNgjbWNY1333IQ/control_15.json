Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did wrong by stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation involves the author, who has been bullied, feeling betrayed when they found out their crush, Beck, was using them for social media posts to win an award.\n\nFirst, the key points here: Beck allegedly used the author for her own benefit, posting things that made the author feel used. The author then decided to withdraw Beck's nomination, leading to Beck's emotional distress. \n\nNow, considering the actions taken. The author didn't just confront Beck but went as far as to sabotage her award chances. Even if Beck was in the wrong, does the author have the right to take such action? Manipulating the nomination process might be unethical or even against the award's rules. The author's actions caused emotional harm to Beck, which is a significant consequence.\n\nThen, there's the emotional aspect. The author has a history of being bullied, which adds context to their feelings of betrayal. However, that doesn't justify retaliating in a way that harms someone else. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if Beck was using the author, the author's response was to actively prevent her from winning, which could be seen as a form of revenge rather than addressing the issue directly.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling ostracized more now. That's a consequence of their action, but does that make them wrong? Not necessarily, but the action itself\u2014interfering with an award nomination\u2014is questionable. The author could have confronted Beck directly, reported the manipulation, or sought support from authorities. Instead, they chose a personal vendetta approach, which is where the wrongdoing might lie.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people are generally expected to resolve conflicts through appropriate channels rather than taking matters into their own hands. The author's actions might have been driven by pain, but the method used is problematic. Even if Beck's intentions were selfish, the author's retaliation crossed a line. The emotional harm caused to Beck, leading her to cry, is a direct result of the author's sabotage. \n\nSo, while Beck's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response of sabotaging her award is not justified. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
