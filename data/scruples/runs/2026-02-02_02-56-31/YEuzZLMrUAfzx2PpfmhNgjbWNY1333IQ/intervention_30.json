  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is 17 and has a history of being bullied due to facial scars. They had a crush on a girl named Beck for a long time and finally asked her out with a lot of effort. The relationship seemed to go well initially, but then they found out that Beck was using their relationship for social media to boost her own image and win an award. She was pretending to be kind and then planned to distance themselves after March. The user, feeling betrayed, took action to stop her from winning the award, which led to her crying and the user becoming more ostracized.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. So, first, I need to consider the ethical implications of the user's actions. The user discovered that Beck was manipulating the relationship for her own benefit. That's a serious betrayal. The user's actions involved checking the award nominations and possibly interfering. But is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were deceitful and hurtful. She used the user's feelings for her own gain, which is wrong. The user had every reason to feel hurt and angry. However, retaliating by sabotaging her award nomination is a different issue. The user's actions caused Beck to lose the nomination, which might have consequences for her college applications. The user might not have considered the broader impact of their actions beyond their personal hurt.\n\nThe user's motivation was revenge and a desire for justice, but is that a valid reason to act in a way that harms someone else? Even if Beck was in the wrong, the user's actions might be considered unethical because they directly interfered with Beck's opportunities. The user didn't report the behavior through proper channels, like telling a teacher or counselor, and instead took matters into their own hands. This could be seen as vigilantism rather than seeking a fair resolution.\n\nAlso, considering the user's history of being bullied, they might have felt powerless and used this as a way to regain control. However, the way they chose to respond could lead to more harm, both for Beck and themselves. The user now faces more ostracism, which might not be fair, but their actions could be seen as equally problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the user's response isn't justified. It's important to address harm without causing further harm. The user might have been seeking justice, but the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the user is at fault for their actions even if their intentions were to correct a wrong done to them. So, the answer would be A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
