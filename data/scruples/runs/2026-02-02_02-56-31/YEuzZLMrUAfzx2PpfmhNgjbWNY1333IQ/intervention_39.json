Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award, which led her to cry. They describe a situation where they were in a relationship with Beck, who they later found out was using them for her own social media image and college applications. The user then took action to withdraw her nomination for an award, resulting in her being ostracized and her nomination being pulled.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user had a crush on Beck, invested a lot of effort into the relationship, and felt betrayed when Beck's friend revealed that Beck was using the user. The user then took action by contacting the award committee, possibly through their friends or family as alibis, leading to Beck's nomination being withdrawn. Now the user is facing backlash but feels justified.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angles. Did Beck's actions cross a line? If Beck was manipulating the user for her own gain, that's unethical. However, the user's response involved sabotaging Beck's award nomination. Even if Beck deserved it, sabotaging someone's opportunity is generally considered wrong. The user's actions led Beck to cry and caused her nomination to be withdrawn, which affects Beck's chances for the award.\n\nThe user might feel justified because of the betrayal, but the method they used to retaliate is questionable. It's about whether the ends justify the means. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the user's action of interfering with the award process could be seen as unethical and possibly illegal, depending on how it was done. The user's motivation was revenge, which is a common human reaction, but it doesn't necessarily make the action right.\n\nAlso, the user mentions being ostracized now, but they have no remorse. This suggests they feel justified, but others around them are saying they're in the wrong. The social aspect here is important because community standards often frown upon revenge, especially when it harms someone else's opportunities.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on both parties. The user was bullied and felt used, which is painful. But Beck was also affected by the user's actions. The situation is a cycle of harm. Even if Beck was manipulative, the user's response perpetuates the harm.\n\nLegal perspective: If the user fabricated information or lied to the committee, that's problematic. If they just informed them about Beck's behavior, maybe not. But without knowing the specifics of how they withdrew the nomination, it's hard to say. However, the user used the Facebook page and possibly spread information, which might involve defamation or other issues.\n\nEmotionally, the user is dealing with betrayal and seeking justice. But acting out of hurt doesn't negate the ethical implications. The user's actions may have caused more harm than good, leading to a worse situation for everyone involved.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the user's response of sabotaging her award nomination is also ethically questionable. The appropriate action would have been to confront Beck directly, report the behavior through proper channels if there was harm, or seek support from authorities without retaliating. Therefore, the user is in the wrong (A) for their actions, even if they were motivated by a sense of betrayal.\n"
