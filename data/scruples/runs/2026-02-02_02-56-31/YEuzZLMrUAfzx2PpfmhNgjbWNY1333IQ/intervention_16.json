Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a crush on a girl named Beck, who they thought was genuine. They went through a lot of effort to ask her out, and for a while, it seemed like things were going well. But then they found out that Beck was using their relationship for her own benefit\u2014specifically, to get a \"positive role model\" award for college applications. She had her friends be nice to the user to create a fake image, and then planned to distance themselves after a certain date.\n\nThe user felt really hurt and betrayed because Beck's actions were manipulative. In response, they took action to stop her from winning the award, which led to Beck crying and the user becoming more ostracized. The user is now struggling with whether they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the user in the wrong for stopping Beck from winning the award? Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Beck's actions: She used the user's feelings to boost her own social media image and college prospects. That's definitely unethical and manipulative. The user was genuinely invested in a real relationship, which was exploited. That's a serious breach of trust.\n\nNow, the user's response. They went to the authorities to check the nominations, used friends and family as alibis, and somehow managed to get Beck's nomination withdrawn. The user claims to have no remorse and feels satisfied. But the consequences were that Beck was upset and the user is now ostracized.\n\nThe key ethical points here are about retaliation and the consequences of one's actions. Even if Beck did something wrong, does that justify the user's actions? Retaliation can often make things worse. The user's actions caused harm to someone else (Beck), even if that person was at fault. The user is now facing social repercussions, which they expected perhaps, but that doesn't make their actions right.\n\nAnother angle: The user's motivation was revenge or a desire to stop Beck from using their feelings. However, the ethical thing might have been to confront Beck directly, perhaps with support from others, rather than interfering with her award. By doing so, the user took a more passive-aggressive approach that backfired.\n\nAlso, considering the user's history of being bullied, they might have acted out of hurt and a desire for justice. But acting out in a way that harms another person, even if they were wrong, can lead to a cycle of negativity. The user might not feel remorse because they believe Beck \"deserved\" it, but that doesn't negate the harm done to Beck and the user's own situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, intentionally sabotaging someone else's opportunity, even if they were manipulative, is generally considered unethical. The user's actions, while perhaps understandable given the betrayal, cross a line into harming another person. The user should have addressed the situation in a way that doesn't involve undermining someone else's achievements, even if those achievements were obtained through manipulation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Beck was wrong, but the user's response was also wrong. Therefore, the user is in the wrong (A).\n"
