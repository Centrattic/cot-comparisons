  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award after she manipulated their feelings. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe person had a crush on Beck, went to a lot of effort to ask her out, and they became friends. Then Beck's friend revealed that Beck was using the relationship to boost her social media image for a college award. The user felt betrayed and decided to have Beck's nomination withdrawn. Now, Beck is upset, and the user is facing backlash.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the user's actions were justified. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Beck used the user's feelings for her own gain, which is definitely manipulative and wrong. The user felt hurt and wanted to prevent her from winning the award, which they saw as undeserved. They might argue they were protecting themselves and exposing her deceit.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's method of stopping Beck involved some form of interference. If they contacted the award committee or provided information that led to her disqualification, that could be seen as unethical or even a violation of privacy or rules. Also, the user is now facing social consequences, which is a result of their actions.\n\nThe user might not have malicious intent beyond wanting to stop Beck from being recognized for something the user believes was insincere. However, the means of stopping her might be questionable. Deliberately sabotaging someone's chance, even if they're being manipulative, could be considered wrong because it's still an act of retaliation that harms another person.\n\nAlso, the user's actions might have gone beyond just exposing the truth. If they took steps to directly prevent Beck from winning without going through proper channels, that's problematic. But if they reported the manipulation to the committee properly, maybe that's a different scenario.\n\nBut in this case, the user mentions they went to the authorities and had their friends and family as alibis, which suggests they took direct action. The committee then withdrew Beck's nomination. So, the user's actions caused Beck to lose the award, leading Beck to cry and the user to be ostracized.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is balancing personal rights and the consequences of one's actions. While Beck's behavior was manipulative and hurtful, the user's response of sabotaging her award might not be the right way to handle it. It's possible that a better approach would have been to confront Beck directly or seek support from a teacher or counselor instead of retaliating.\n\nMoreover, the user's actions could be seen as taking justice into their own hands, which might not be fair. They might not have the authority to decide Beck's fate. Even if Beck deserved it, the method of removal was not the user's place to enforce.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user did something that caused harm to Beck, even if they felt justified. The user's satisfaction in the outcome doesn't negate the fact that the method used was unethical. So, while Beck's actions were wrong, the user's response also has its own issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be that the user is in the wrong (A), because they retaliated in a way that's not appropriate, even if the other person was at fault. It's important to address manipulation through proper channels and not through sabotage.\n"
