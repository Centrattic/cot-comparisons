Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. So, the user is 17 and has a history of being bullied because of their scars. They really like a girl named Beck, go through a lot of effort to ask her out, and she says yes. But then they find out that Beck was only being nice to them to win an award, and she's planning to distance herself after. The user then takes action to stop her from winning the award, leading Beck to cry and the user becoming more ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The user's actions were based on being deceived. Beck used them, which is definitely wrong. But the user then decides to sabotage Beck's award. Is that justified? On one hand, Beck's actions were manipulative and hurtful. On the other hand, the user's retaliation involved undermining an award, which could be seen as unethical. The user might be acting out of pain and betrayal, but does that make it okay?\n\nAlso, the user mentions that they have a history of being bullied and feeling ostracized. This context might make their reaction more understandable emotionally, but doesn't necessarily excuse the action. The user is taking a proactive step to prevent Beck from getting recognition, which could be considered a form of revenge. Even if Beck deserved it, is it right to take matters into one's own hands?\n\nAnother angle is the impact. Beck is crying, and the user is now even more ostracized. The user might feel justified, but their action has caused emotional harm to Beck. Is causing someone to cry a fair consequence? Also, the user's motivation was to seek justice for being used, but the method might be problematic. The award was probably meant to recognize positive behavior, and the user's intervention might have prevented Beck from receiving it for unethical reasons, which could be seen as a positive. But the user's approach bypassed proper channels, like reporting the manipulation to the authorities instead of sabotaging.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The user was wronged, but their response was also harmful. The question is whether the ends justify the means. If Beck was indeed using people for the award, stopping her could be seen as preventing further harm. However, the method of doing so might not be appropriate. The user could have reported Beck to the award committee or spoken to a teacher instead of taking direct action. By doing it themselves, the user might be contributing to a cycle of revenge and causing more harm than good.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's actions were inexcusable and hurtful, the user's response involved taking action that directly affected Beck's award, which could be considered wrong because it's a form of personal retaliation rather than reporting the issue through proper channels. So, the user is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
