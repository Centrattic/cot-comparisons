Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a crush on Beck, who manipulated them to gain social media attention for a college application award. Beck pretended to be kind and accepted the author's advances, but all along, she had a plan to distance herself after March. The author found out through a friend and then took action to remove Beck's nomination for the award, which succeeded. Now, Beck is upset, and the author is being criticized.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Beck used the author's feelings for her own benefit, and the author retaliated by sabotaging her award. The question is whether the author was wrong in doing so.\n\nOn one side, Beck's actions were manipulative and dishonest. She led the author on, used them for image, and then planned to cut them off. That's definitely unethical and hurtful. The author was in a vulnerable position because of their past trauma and the bullying they've faced. Their feelings of betrayal and anger are understandable.\n\nOn the other side, the author's response was to actively interfere with Beck's award nomination. This is a direct violation of the award's process. Even if Beck was manipulative, sabotaging someone's opportunity, even if they deserve it, is not the right approach. The author's actions caused Beck to cry and led to the author being ostracized more, which complicates things.\n\nBut then again, Beck's actions were malicious. The author might feel justified because they were the victim of a scam. However, the method of retaliation\u2014intentionally ruining Beck's chances\u2014could be seen as crossing a line. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's action is still unethical and possibly illegal if they falsified information or hacked the nomination. However, the post mentions that the author found a Facebook page and confirmed the nomination, then had friends and family as alibis. It's unclear if there was any illegal activity, just that the author informed the committee to remove Beck's name.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongness, the author might feel justified, but in reality, retaliating by sabotaging someone else's achievements is generally considered wrong. The right approach would be to report the manipulation to the appropriate authorities or seek support without taking matters into one's own hands. The author's actions disrupted a process they weren't part of, possibly undermining the integrity of the award.\n\nSo, while Beck's behavior was clearly wrong, the author's response is also problematic. The author's actions may have been an attempt at justice, but the method used is not acceptable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they took unethical action, even if the motive was revenge for being manipulated.\n"
