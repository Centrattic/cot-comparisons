  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a crush on a girl named Beck, asked her out, and things seemed to go well. But then they found out that Beck was using their attention to boost her own image for a college award. She was pretending to be kind and interacting with the user as part of a scheme to get a \"positive role model\" award. The user, feeling betrayed, took action to stop her from winning the award, which ended up making Beck cry and caused the user to be ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The user was manipulated by Beck, who used their feelings for personal gain. That's pretty hurtful. But does that justify the user's actions in stopping Beck from winning the award? The user went to the authorities with evidence, got their nomination withdrawn. But was that the right way to handle it?\n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were deceptive and exploited the user's emotions. That's not okay. On the other hand, retaliating by sabotaging her award application might not be the best approach. The user's actions caused Beck emotional distress and affected their school reputation. Even if Beck was in the wrong, does the user have the right to take matters into their own hands?\n\nI think there's a balance here. While Beck's behavior was manipulative and hurtful, the user's response was to actively interfere with her award, which could be seen as unethical. The user might have felt justified given the betrayal, but revenge isn't typically considered the right solution. Maybe the user should have reported the manipulation to the authorities in a proper way, rather than directly causing Beck to lose the award. \n\nAlso, the user's actions led to their own increased ostracization, which is a consequence they might not have anticipated. While they feel satisfaction now, the long-term effects might be negative. So, even though Beck was wrong, the user's actions could still be considered wrong because they took revenge instead of addressing it through appropriate channels.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though Beck's actions were bad, the user's retaliation might not be the right approach. Therefore, the user is likely in the wrong.\n"
