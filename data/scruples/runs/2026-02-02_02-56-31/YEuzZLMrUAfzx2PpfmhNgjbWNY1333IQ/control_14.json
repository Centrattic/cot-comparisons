Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and they had a good time. Then Beck's friend revealed that Beck was using the author to boost her image for an award. The author found out Beck's plan, which was manipulative and deceitful. The author then took action to have Beck's nomination removed, leading to Beck's emotional distress.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Beck's manipulation, the author's retaliation, and the consequences. The author felt betrayed and hurt, which is understandable. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were unethical. She used the author's feelings for her own benefit, which is definitely wrong. The author had a right to feel hurt and seek some form of justice. However, the author's method of retaliating by interfering with the award process might be problematic. Deliberately sabotaging someone's nomination, even if they deserved it, could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The author didn't go through proper channels to address the issue, like confronting Beck directly or reporting the manipulation to the appropriate authorities in a legitimate way. Instead, they took action that directly harmed Beck, which could be considered revenge rather than justice.\n\nAlso, the author's actions led to Beck crying and being ostracized. Even if Beck was manipulative, causing emotional harm in return might not be the right approach. It's important to consider the ethics of retaliation. While Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response might have crossed a line. The author's justification is that Beck used them, but the method of stopping her from the award could be seen as equally harmful.\n\nSo, while Beck is at fault for her manipulation, the author's actions in directly sabotaging the award nomination could still be considered wrong because it's retaliatory and not handled through proper means. Therefore, the author is partially in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that they took deliberate steps to ruin Beck's chances, even if justified by the circumstances, it's a gray area. But typically, taking matters into your own hands and causing harm, even in response to being wronged, is considered the wrong approach. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
