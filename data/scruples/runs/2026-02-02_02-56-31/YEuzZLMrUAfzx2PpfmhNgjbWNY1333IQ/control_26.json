Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about someone who stopped their classmate from winning an award by providing information that led to her nomination being withdrawn. The classmate, referred to as Beck, had apparently used the author's feelings for social media clout and a college application award. The author, after feeling betrayed, took action that caused Beck to lose the award and is now facing backlash themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Beck's actions were deceitful; she pretended to be kind to the author for her own benefit. The author discovered this and decided to retaliate by exposing her. The question is whether this retaliation is justified.\n\nOn one hand, Beck manipulated the author's emotions for her own gain, which is clearly wrong. The author was vulnerable after an accident and had formed a genuine emotional connection. Beck's exploitation of that for an award is exploitative and unethical. The author's actions could be seen as a form of justice, holding Beck accountable for her deceit.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's method of stopping Beck involved actively interfering with her award nomination. This could be considered unethical because it involves undermining someone else's actions, even if those actions were wrong. The author's actions may have crossed a line by using the information they discovered to directly sabotage Beck's opportunity, which could be seen as revenge rather than a justified response.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the author. They were already ostracized and vulnerable, and this incident likely caused them significant emotional distress. Their decision might stem from a place of self-defense and protecting their own well-being, especially after being used. However, the method of retaliation could have been handled differently, perhaps by reporting Beck's actions to the appropriate authorities instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nEthically, there's a debate between justice and revenge. If the author reported Beck's manipulation through proper channels, that might be more justifiable. But since they took direct action to remove Beck's nomination, it might be seen as taking revenge, which some might argue is not the right approach, regardless of Beck's wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the consequences for the author are significant\u2014being ostracized more. But they might feel that the emotional relief from stopping Beck outweighs the social consequences. However, the broader implications involve whether it's acceptable to retaliate against someone's unethical behavior by engaging in similar unethical behavior.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the principle of \"do not do evil to do good\" applies. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's actions may not be justified if they involve dishonesty or sabotage. Alternatively, in a situation where the system (like the award committee) didn't address Beck's manipulation, the author's actions might be seen as necessary to correct an injustice.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions are a form of retaliation. While Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response of directly sabotaging her award nomination could be seen as equally unethical. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for retaliating in a harmful way, even if their intentions were to address a prior wrong.\n"
