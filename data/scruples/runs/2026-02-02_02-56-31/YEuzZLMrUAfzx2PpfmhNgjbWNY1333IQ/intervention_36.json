Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award after finding out she was using them for her college application. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user had a crush on Beck, they went on a date, and then found out Beck was manipulating people to be nice to them for an award. The user then took action to have her nomination withdrawn, which made Beck cry and caused the user to be ostracized.\n\nSo, the key points here: the user felt betrayed, took action based on that betrayal, and now is questioning their actions. The question is about whether it was the right thing to do.\n\nNow, considering the options. Option A says the user is in the wrong. Option B says they're not. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, sabotaging someone's award nomination might be seen as a wrong action, regardless of the motivation. Even if the other person was being manipulative, the user's response could be considered unethical or even bullying. However, there's context about the user being bullied themselves, which might add nuance. \n\nBut actions have consequences. The user's actions affected Beck's opportunities and caused her emotional distress. Even if Beck was using them, the user's retaliation could be seen as disproportionate. The user might not be entirely in the wrong, but they did take a harmful action. \n\nOn the other hand, Beck's manipulation was morally wrong, which could justify the user's feelings. But does that justify sabotaging her? That's a tricky part. There's no clear right answer here, but usually, ethical behavior involves addressing issues through appropriate channels rather than personal vendettas. \n\nThe user's motivation is important. If Beck was lying to the award committee, then the committee should have found out on their own. The user's action might be seen as interfering in a process that should be evaluated by the right people. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if Beck was at fault, the user's action was likely wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A. But the user's history of being bullied adds complexity. However, that doesn't make the action right. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
