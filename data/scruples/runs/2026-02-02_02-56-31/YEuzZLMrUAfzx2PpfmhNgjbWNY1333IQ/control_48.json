Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a crush on Beck, who they believed genuinely liked them. They went on a date and felt accepted. Then they found out Beck was using them for a \"positive role model\" award by pretending to be nice. The author then took action to stop Beck from winning, leading to her nomination being withdrawn and her crying.\n\nSo, the key points here. Beck was manipulating the author for her own gain, using their feelings. The author discovered this deceit and took action. The question is whether the author was justified in doing so.\n\nThe author's actions involved researching the award, confirming her nomination, and then taking steps to make sure she didn't win. The result was Beck losing the nomination and the author becoming more ostracized. The author feels no remorse but is now facing backlash.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. Beck's actions were unethical\u2014using someone's emotions for personal gain, faking kindness to get an award. The author, upon discovering this, took a proactive step to counteract it. But was it the right way to handle it?\n\nLegally, if the author used unethical methods (like spreading false information or interfering) to stop Beck, that's wrong. But if they simply informed the committee of Beck's deception, maybe not. However, the author mentions going to authorities to confirm the nomination and getting alibis. Maybe they provided evidence of Beck's false actions, which could be justified. However, the method of stopping her might involve privacy violations or other issues.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author was a victim of manipulation and may feel justified in exposing it. But using underhanded tactics to prevent someone from winning an award could still be considered wrong, even if the person was in the wrong. The fact that the author is now facing ostracism might be a consequence of their actions.\n\nAlso, the author's emotional state is important\u2014they were hurt and frustrated. However, retaliating by ruining someone else's chances, even if that person did wrong, could be seen as taking justice into their own hands. The proper course would be to report the manipulation to the appropriate authorities rather than take direct action to sabotage.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response might not be justified. Sabotaging her award could be seen as crossing a line, even if it's a reaction to being used. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
