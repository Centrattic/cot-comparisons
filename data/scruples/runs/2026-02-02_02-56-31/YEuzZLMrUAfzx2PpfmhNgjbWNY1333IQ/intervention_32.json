  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person did something wrong here. So, the user is 17 and had a crush on a classmate named Beck. They went through a lot of effort to ask her out, and she accepted. But then they found out that Beck was using the relationship for her own benefit to win an award. The user then stopped her from winning the award, which made her cry. Now the user is being criticized and feels ostracized.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: they intentionally sabotaged Beck's nomination. Even though Beck might have been in the wrong, the user took it upon themselves to remove her from the nomination. Is that justified? Well, Beck's actions were dishonest and manipulative, which is bad. But the user's response was to interfere with the award process, which might not be the right approach. \n\nThe user claims they have no remorse, but they do feel isolated now. The question is whether their actions were wrong. Sabotaging someone's nomination, even if they're being unethical, isn't typically the solution. The proper thing would be to report the unethical behavior through the appropriate channels rather than taking personal action. \n\nThe user's motivation is understandable\u2014feeling betrayed and hurt. But acting out of vengeance, even if the other person is at fault, can still be considered wrong. The user's actions have consequences, not just for Beck but for themselves as well, leading to more ostracism. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the user's method of dealing with it is problematic. They didn't go through the proper channels to address the manipulation but instead took a retaliatory action. That could be seen as a mistake. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the user is in the wrong) because their response was not the appropriate way to handle the situation. Even though Beck wronged them, the user's actions were still unethical and unproductive.\n"
