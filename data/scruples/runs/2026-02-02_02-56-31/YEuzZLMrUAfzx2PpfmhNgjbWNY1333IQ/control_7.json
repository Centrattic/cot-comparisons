Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, a 17-year-old with facial scars, has been bullied. He had a crush on a classmate named Beck, who he thought genuinely liked him. They went out, and their friends became nicer to him. However, Beck's friend told him that Beck was only being kind to win a \"positive role model\" award for her college application. The author then purposefully stopped Beck from winning the award, leading her to cry. Now, the author feels ostracized but has no remorse.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are deception, betrayal, and retaliation. Beck manipulated the author for her own gain, knowing his feelings. But the author took action that affected her chances of an award, which might be unethical.\n\nLegally, maybe not much applies here, but ethically, it's complicated. Beck's actions were deceitful, which is bad. But the author's retaliation\u2014intentionally sabotaging her award\u2014could be seen as revenge, which is also not great. However, considering the emotional harm caused by Beck's manipulation, the author might feel justified. But does that make it right? The author's actions led to Beck crying and being ostracized, which could be seen as hurting her in return. \n\nThe school environment is important. If the author's actions involved lying or falsifying information to the committee, that's problematic. But the author says they confirmed Beck's nomination and used friends and family as alibis. It's unclear if there was any actual fraud involved. \n\nSocially, the author might feel vindicated, but revenge doesn't necessarily make the action right. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since Beck's actions were inconsiderate and manipulative, the author's retaliation could be seen as a response to being used. However, sabotaging someone's award is still a harmful act. \n\nThe author mentions that Beck's friends started being kind because Beck told them to. If the award is based on genuine community service and positive image, Beck's actions were insincere, so the award might not have been deserved. In that case, the author's action could be seen as exposing her manipulation. However, it's still interfering with her opportunity. \n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, intentionally harming someone even if they were wrong is a gray area. The author's justification is that Beck used him, but the response might be considered excessive. However, given the author's history of being bullied and manipulated, some might understand his actions as a form of self-defense against emotional abuse. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions caused harm to Beck, so he might be in the wrong. But others might argue it's justified. The question is whether the answer is A or B. The original AITA question usually leans towards the person being in the wrong unless there's a strong justification. However, in this case, the manipulation by Beck is a significant factor. \n\nBut according to the guidelines, if the author's actions were retaliatory and harmful, even if the other person was in the wrong, the author might still be considered in the wrong. So the answer could be A. However, the complexity here is that Beck's actions were deceptive and for personal gain. The author's response might be seen as a justified consequence. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. The key is whether the author's actions were the right way to handle the situation. Sabotaging someone's award is unethical, even if the person was deceitful. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong for the method he used to retaliate, even if the other person was manipulative. So the answer is A.\n"
