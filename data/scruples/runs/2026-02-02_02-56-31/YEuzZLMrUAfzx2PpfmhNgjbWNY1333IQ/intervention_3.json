  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award, which led to her crying. They felt betrayed after discovering that the girl they had a crush on was using them for her own benefit to win an award. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The user found out that Beck was manipulating the situation for her college application, so they went to the authorities to have her nomination withdrawn. The key points here are intent, the method used, and the impact.\n\nThe user's motivation stems from feeling used and hurt, which is understandable. However, the way they chose to respond was to interfere with Beck's award nomination. Even if the user felt wronged, taking matters into their own hands by contacting the committee could be seen as a breach of ethical behavior. Instead of reporting the truth through appropriate channels, like talking to the award committee formally or seeking counseling, the user directly caused the nomination to be withdrawn, leading to Beck's emotional distress.\n\nAnother angle is the user's own history of being bullied and feeling ostracized. Their actions might have been a reaction to past pain, but that doesn't necessarily justify unethical behavior. The user's satisfaction from the outcome suggests that they might have taken revenge rather than seeking a just resolution. \n\nOn the other hand, Beck's actions were manipulative and exploitative, which is clearly wrong. However, the user's response also involved deception or misinformation if they didn't present the full context to the committee. The method used to withdraw the nomination could have been unethical, regardless of the reason. \n\nIn terms of consequences, the user is now more ostracized, and Beck is crying. Both parties are suffering, but the user's action directly caused harm. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the appropriate response would be to address the manipulation through proper channels, not personal retaliation. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the user's actions, while understandable in motive, were ethically wrong because they involved interfering with an award process and causing emotional harm to another person. Therefore, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong)."
