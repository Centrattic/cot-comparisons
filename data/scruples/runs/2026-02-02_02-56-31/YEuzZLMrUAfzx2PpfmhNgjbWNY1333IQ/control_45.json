Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author stopping their classmate, Beck, from winning an award by making her cry. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of being bullied due to facial scars from an accident. They had a crush on Beck, went to great lengths to ask her out, and their relationship seemed to blossom. But then Beck's friend revealed that Beck was using the author for her own benefit\u2014posting about their relationship on social media to create a \"positive role model\" image for a college application award. The author, feeling betrayed and using information from the friend, contacted the award committee to withdraw Beck's nomination, leading to her crying and the author becoming more ostracized.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Beck allegedly manipulated the author for social media image and an award. The author, upon discovering this, took action to stop her nomination. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, Beck's actions seem manipulative and inconsiderate. However, the author's response was to interfere with the award process. Is that justified? The author admits to no remorse and feels satisfaction, which might indicate they believe Beck deserved it. But is revenge or sabotage an appropriate response?\n\nLegally, if the award process was being misrepresented, the author might have a point. But ethically, taking matters into their own hands without going through proper channels (like reporting the issue to the committee first) could be problematic. The author didn't confront Beck directly or let the committee decide, which might have been a more appropriate approach.\n\nAlso, the aftermath caused Beck to cry and the author to be ostracized. The author's actions led to emotional distress for both parties. While Beck's actions were clearly unethical, the author's retaliation might be seen as equally harmful. Revenge can perpetuate a cycle of harm.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: Beck is wrong for manipulating the author's feelings for personal gain. The author is wrong for retaliating in a way that caused harm to Beck and possibly violating the award's procedures. The author's lack of remorse suggests a lack of empathy for Beck's feelings, even if Beck was manipulative.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because their response was vengeful and caused further harm. However, Beck's manipulation is definitely the root issue. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. The answer likely points to A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while Beck was the initial wrongdoer, the author's retaliation isn't justified and caused direct harm. However, some might argue the author had a valid reason. Need to weigh the balance here.\n"
