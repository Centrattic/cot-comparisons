Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award after finding out she used them for her college application. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The user had a crush on Beck, who pretended to be nice to them for a few days. Beck's friend told the user that Beck was doing this to get a \"positive role model\" award. The user then took action to have Beck's nomination withdrawn, which made her cry. Now the user is facing backlash but feels justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user discovered that Beck was using them for personal gain, leading to emotional harm. The user then took steps to prevent Beck from winning the award. The user doesn't feel remorse and is questioned by others about their actions. \n\nNow, considering the ethics of the situation. Beck's actions were deceptive and manipulative, which is clearly wrong. However, retaliating by interfering with her award nomination might not be the right approach. While Beck's intentions are bad, the user's response involves sabotage, which can be seen as harmful and unethical as well. \n\nThe user might feel justified because Beck used them, but the method of retaliation could have consequences beyond just the award. It's possible that Beck's actions were wrong, but the user's actions could have their own negative repercussions, like the school environment becoming more hostile towards the user or others. \n\nAlso, the user's history of being bullied and having scars adds context to their emotional state, but doesn't excuse the retaliatory action. The question is whether stopping someone from winning an award is a fair response to being used. \n\nIn many cases, the appropriate action would be to confront the person, report the behavior to authorities, or seek support, rather than taking matters into one's own hands. The user's action might be seen as taking justice into their own hands, which is not typically advised because it can escalate conflicts and lead to more harm.\n\nHowever, there might be arguments that Beck's manipulation was a bigger wrong, so the user's action was a form of justice. But generally, ethical guidelines suggest that retaliation is not the solution, even if the initial wrongdoing was significant. \n\nTherefore, while Beck was in the wrong for manipulating the user, the user's decision to actively prevent her from receiving the award could be considered ethically wrong as well. The user's actions caused harm to Beck and potentially made the school environment worse. The user might not feel remorse, but from an ethical standpoint, it's more about whether the action was appropriate, not just the feelings involved.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the user is in the wrong) because the retaliation, while understandable, is not the correct approach. The user should have addressed the situation through proper channels rather than sabotaging Beck's award.\n"
