She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, and even physical assault. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and she's been arrested before for domestic violence. The user called the police again because they feared for their safety and their parents' well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is in immediate danger and there's a history of violence, calling the police is a reasonable action. The sister has already been arrested once, so this isn't the first time. The user's actions could be seen as protecting themselves and their family, which is a valid reason. \n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The parents are upset because they feel the user ruined their daughter's life. But from the user's perspective, they're trying to stop ongoing abuse. The sister's refusal to seek help and her continued violent behavior suggests that the situation isn't improving on its own. \n\nThe key points are the sister's violent actions, the history of arrests, and the user's fear for safety. Legally, reporting domestic violence is justified. Ethically, protecting oneself and others from harm is right. The parents' anger might stem from wanting to protect their child, but that doesn't excuse the sister's behavior. \n\nI think the user is in the right here. They took a necessary step to ensure safety. Answer B.\n"
