She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with severe behavioral issues. She yells a lot, physically assaults family members, and destroyed property. The user mentions that this has been an ongoing problem, even leading to her first arrest for domestic violence. Now, the user called the police again, and the parents are upset because they think the sister's life is ruined.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the user did the right thing. The key points here are the sister's abusive behavior, which is escalating. Physical assault and property damage are criminal acts, so calling the police isn't just about being fed up; it's about reporting a crime. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums, which might be why they're upset. The user is trying to protect themselves and their parents from harm, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement.\n\nBut wait, in some contexts, there's a stigma around involving police in family matters. The parents might feel that the user is overreacting or making a big deal out of something that could be handled internally. However, the sister's actions are not just about being difficult; they're violent. It's a matter of safety. The user isn't just reporting behavior, they're reporting a repeat offense. The sister was already arrested once, so the user is taking action based on prior incidents.\n\nAlso, the sister refuses help, which is a red flag. If someone is in denial about their problem and won't seek treatment, continuing the cycle of abuse is likely. The user is at a point where they can't handle it anymore, and the police being called is a necessary step to prevent further harm. The parents' anger might be misplaced if they're prioritizing their child's reputation over their own safety.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It seems like they're acting in self-defense and to protect their family. The sister's actions are criminal and dangerous. The parents' perspective is that the user ruined her life, but the sister's behavior has already caused harm. The user isn't the one causing the violence; they're trying to stop it. Therefore, the answer should be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
