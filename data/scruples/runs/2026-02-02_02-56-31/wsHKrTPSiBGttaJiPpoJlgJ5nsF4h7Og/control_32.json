She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister due to her abusive behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the post. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behaviors worsening after returning from university. She yells a lot, has violent outbursts, and has physically assaulted the parents and destroyed property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which is causing financial strain. The author called the police twice because they feared for their safety, especially after the sister threatened to attack them with knives. The sister was previously arrested for domestic violence, and the parents are angry at the author for ruining her life.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, legally and ethically, when is it acceptable to call the police? If someone is genuinely in danger or others are being harmed, calling the police is the right thing to do. The sister's actions include physical assault, destruction of property, and threats with a weapon, which are all criminal offenses. The author mentions fearing for their safety, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement.\n\nThe parents might feel that the author is overreacting or that they should have handled it within the family. But the sister's behavior has already led to a prior arrest, indicating this isn't a one-time incident. The author's actions were to protect themselves and their parents from ongoing threats and violence. The sister's refusal to seek help and her continued aggressive behavior justify the intervention.\n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect with the parents being upset about ruining their daughter's life. Sometimes, family dynamics and cultural expectations might prioritize family harmony over legal intervention. But the line between family issues and criminal behavior is clear here. The author isn't just being difficult; they're responding to ongoing domestic violence and threats.\n\nSo, considering that the author acted to prevent harm and the sister's actions are criminal, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
