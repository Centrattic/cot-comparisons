She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior: she's narcissistic, materialistic, and has a history of screaming, throwing tantrums, and even physical violence. The user mentions that the sister has hit their parents and destroyed property. There's also a previous arrest for domestic violence, and this is the second offense. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which is causing financial strain. The user feels that their sister's threats (like with knives) are serious enough that they no longer keep knives in the house. The user called the police out of fear for their safety and their parents' well-being.\n\nNow, legally, if someone is engaging in domestic violence, calling the police is appropriate. The sister has a history, so the user is taking action to prevent further harm. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined their sister's life, but the sister's actions are the root cause. The user isn't the one committing violence; they're reporting it. The sister's refusal to seek help also plays a role here. The user's actions seem to be self-defense and protecting their family. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because they're taking a stand against abuse.\n"
