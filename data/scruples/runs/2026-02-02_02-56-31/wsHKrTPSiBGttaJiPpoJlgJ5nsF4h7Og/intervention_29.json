She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, is aggressive, and has even physically assaulted their parents. The user mentions that their parents are working class and worked hard to fund her education. The user themselves earned a full ride to college. The sister has been arrested once before for domestic violence and the user called the police again, leading to her second arrest. The parents are upset with the user for ruining their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. The user called the police because of physical assault and threats. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the user genuinely feared for their safety, then calling the police is a reasonable response. Legally, calling the police to report a threat or actual assault is not wrong. The user also mentions that they and their parents tried to get her help, but she refused. So there's an effort to address the issue non-legally first.\n\nThe parents are upset because they feel the user ruined their daughter's life, but the sister's behavior is escalating and dangerous. The user's actions were to protect their family. The sister's refusal to seek help and continued aggression makes the user's decision more understandable. In such cases, self-protection and protecting family members is a valid reason. So the answer would be B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
