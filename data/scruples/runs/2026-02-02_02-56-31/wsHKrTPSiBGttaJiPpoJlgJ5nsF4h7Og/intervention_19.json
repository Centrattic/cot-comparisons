She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that's gotten worse after being abroad. She yells a lot, hits the parents, destroys property, and even threatened to use knives. The user had to work hard for a full ride to college to avoid their parents going into debt, and they've already had her arrested once before for domestic violence.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the sister's behavior, which seems abusive. The user's parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands and not protecting the user. The user felt they had no choice but to call the police again, especially since there's a previous arrest and the sister is now a second offender. \n\nI need to consider if calling the police was the right action. From a legal standpoint, if someone is physically assaulting another person or threatening them with weapons, calling the police is appropriate. The user was protecting their parents and themselves from harm. The parents might be upset because they don't want their child to be arrested, but that doesn't make the user wrong for seeking legal help when necessary.\n\nAlso, the sister has refused professional help, which complicates things. The user isn't responsible for their sister's mental health if she's unwilling to seek it. The user's actions were about safety, not just annoyance. So, in this case, the user is probably in the right. The parents might not see it that way, but the user's decision to involve the police is justified given the severity of the abuse and the previous offense.\n"
