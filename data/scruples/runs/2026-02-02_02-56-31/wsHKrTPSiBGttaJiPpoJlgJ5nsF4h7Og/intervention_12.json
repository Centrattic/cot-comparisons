She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with a narcissistic and materialistic personality that's gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, is physically abusive towards the parents, and destroyed property. The user called the police twice, leading to her arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined her life, and the sister refuses help. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is engaging in domestic violence, including physical assault and threats, calling the police is a legitimate action to protect oneself and others. The sister already has a prior offense, so the situation is escalating. The parents might feel conflicted because they might see the sister as a child, but the user's safety and their parents' safety are paramount.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are enabling the sister by giving in to her tantrums, which could be part of the problem. The user is trying to stop the abuse, even if it causes family tension. The sister's refusal to seek help compounds the issue. \n\nThe question is whether the user did the right thing. The user had a valid reason to fear for their safety and their parents', so calling the police to address domestic violence is justified. The parents' anger might stem from their own feelings of guilt or a desire to protect their child, but the user isn't in the wrong for acting to stop abuse. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
