She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister. From the details given, the sister sounds like she has significant behavioral issues\u2014yelling constantly, physically assaulting family members, destroying property, and even threatening to use knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums, and they're upset with the user for taking action.\n\nFirst, the user called the police because they and their parents were in fear for their safety. The sister has a history of domestic violence, even being arrested before. The user's actions were to protect themselves and their family. Legally, if someone is in imminent danger, calling the police is the right thing to do. Also, the sister's refusal to seek help despite the family's attempts shows she's not addressing the problem. The parents' anger seems to stem from wanting to protect their child rather than the well-being of the whole family.\n\nBut I should consider the cultural context. In some cultures, family issues are kept private, and involving authorities might be seen as extreme. However, the sister's actions are criminal (assault, property damage), so reporting them isn't just a family matter. The user isn't in the wrong for preventing harm. The sister's behavior is abusive, and the user acted to stop it. So the answer should be B.\n"
