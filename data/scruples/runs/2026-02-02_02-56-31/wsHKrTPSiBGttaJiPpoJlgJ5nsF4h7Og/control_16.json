She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister. The situation is that their sister is very narcissistic and materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, is physically abusive towards their parents, and there's a history of domestic violence. The user called the police again because they were scared for their family's safety.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the sister's physical assault, destruction of property, and threats with knives. The parents have tried to accommodate her, but she's not getting help. The author called the police to protect themselves and their parents. \n\nIn most cases, if someone is in immediate danger and the authorities are called to handle a known abuser, that's a legitimate action. The sister already had a prior arrest for domestic violence, so the author was aware of the risks. The parents are upset because they feel it ruined the sister's life, but the author's priority was safety. \n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help and the repeated offenses make the situation serious. The author isn't just overreacting; they're trying to prevent further harm. So the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
