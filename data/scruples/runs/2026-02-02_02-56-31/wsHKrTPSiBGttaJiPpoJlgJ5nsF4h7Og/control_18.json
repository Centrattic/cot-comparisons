She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user called the police on their sister because she's been acting out, hitting parents, destroying property, and threatening them with knives. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined their sister's life. The sister has a history of this, even been arrested before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws around domestic violence and police intervention. If someone is threatening with knives and physically assaulting family members, that's a serious issue. Calling the police in such a case is usually seen as a responsible action to ensure safety. The user mentions fearing for their and their parents' well-being, which is a valid reason to involve authorities.\n\nThe parents are upset because they might feel protective of their child, even if the child is abusive. But the user's actions were to protect themselves and their parents from harm. The sister's behavior is also documented, with a prior arrest. The user tried to get her help through professionals, but she refused. \n\nSo, the key points are: the sister's violent behavior, the user's attempt to seek help, and the justified fear for safety. The user's action of calling the police seems like a reasonable response to prevent further harm. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
