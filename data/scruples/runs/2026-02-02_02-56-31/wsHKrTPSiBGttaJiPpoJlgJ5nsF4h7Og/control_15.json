She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation describes a sister with narcissistic and abusive behavior, including physical assault and property destruction. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author felt compelled to call the police again because of the threats and fear for their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister has a history of violence, including domestic violence charges. The author mentions that this is the second offense. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined the sister's life, but the author is concerned about their safety. \n\nLegally, calling the police when there's a threat to safety is generally justified. Especially if there's a history of abuse and the person has been arrested before. The author isn't just reacting to a minor dispute but to ongoing violent behavior and threats. \n\nEthically, the author is prioritizing their safety and their parents' well-being. The sister's refusal to seek help and continued harmful actions make the situation more severe. The author didn't take matters into their own hands beyond reporting the abuse, which is a responsible action. \n\nThe parents' anger might stem from cultural or emotional factors, but the author isn't obligated to let abuse continue. The key here is that the author acted to stop imminent harm, which is a valid reason. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They took legal steps to protect themselves and their family from ongoing abuse and threats. The sister's actions are the main issue here, not the author's decision to involve authorities.\n"
