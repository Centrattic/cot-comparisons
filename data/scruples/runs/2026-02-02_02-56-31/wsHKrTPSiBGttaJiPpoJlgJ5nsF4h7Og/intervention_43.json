She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a sister who's been acting out, and the person called the police on her. The sister has a history of yelling, threatening, and even physical violence. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The person is frustrated because their sister is being abusive, and they called the police the second time, leading to an arrest. Now the parents are angry at them for ruining their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's behavior includes screaming, threatening with knives, and physical assault. The parents are not standing up to her and instead cave in, which is allowing the behavior to continue. The person called the police because they were scared for their safety and their parents' well-being. They mention the sister was already arrested once for domestic violence, and this is the second offense. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, if someone is in immediate danger and a threat is present, calling the police is a reasonable action. The sister's actions meet the criteria for domestic violence, especially since she's physically assaulting family members and threatening with weapons. The person is acting to protect themselves and their family from harm, which is a valid reason. \n\nThe parents' anger might stem from wanting to protect their child, even if that child is abusive. They might feel that the legal system will have harsh consequences for their daughter, hence the belief that the person ruined her life. But from a standpoint of safety, the person isn't wrong to take action when their family is in danger. \n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help or accept that she has issues adds to the problem. The person is trying to enforce boundaries and protect their home environment. Since the sister has a history of violence, the police response is appropriate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. They're taking necessary steps to ensure their safety and their family's safety. The parents' enabling behavior is part of the problem, but the person isn't responsible for that. Their action of calling the police was justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
