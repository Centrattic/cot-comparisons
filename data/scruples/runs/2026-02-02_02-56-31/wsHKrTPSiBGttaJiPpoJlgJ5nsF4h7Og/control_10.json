She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation is pretty intense. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, hits the parents, and destroys property. The parents keep giving in to her demands, which the author is upset about. The author called the police again because they're scared and the sister has a history of domestic violence. The parents are now angry with the author for ruining the sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did the right thing by involving the police. The sister's actions include physical assault and property damage, which are criminal offenses. The author mentions that the sister has been arrested before for domestic violence, so this is a repeat offense. The parents are enabling her by not setting boundaries, which is a problem. The author is trying to protect themselves and their parents, which is understandable.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect here? In some cultures, calling the police on a family member might be seen as extreme. The parents' reaction suggests they might value family harmony over legal action. However, the sister's behavior is escalating and dangerous. The author has a right to safety. The sister's refusal to seek help is another factor. \n\nThe key points are that the police were called due to actual criminal behavior (assault, destruction of property), not just yelling. The author feared for their safety and the parents' well-being. Even if the parents are upset, the author is acting in self-defense and to protect others from harm. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're taking necessary steps to address a dangerous situation that others aren't handling.\n"
