She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, and even physically assaulting their parents. The user mentions that the sister was previously arrested for domestic violence and this is her second offense. They also tried to get her help, but she refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The sister is 21 and has been abusive, both verbally and physically. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which is causing ongoing harm. The user acted to protect themselves and their parents from potential serious injury or worse, by calling the police again. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user's actions are about seeking safety. Even if the parents are upset, the sister's behavior is dangerous and illegal. The user can't be blamed for reporting a crime, especially one that involves violence. The parents might feel it's ruining the sister's life, but that's their perspective. The user's safety and the safety of others should take precedence. \n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to get help is a red flag. If she's a threat, the user has a right to involve authorities. So, the answer is probably B, they are not in the wrong. But I should make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The user's reasoning is about protecting their family from ongoing abuse, and the sister's actions are criminal. The user isn't the asshole here.\n"
