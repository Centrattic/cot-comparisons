She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation seems pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, and it's gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, is violent towards the parents, and even destroyed property. The parents won't stand up to her, caving in when she throws tantrums. The author worked hard to get a full ride to college to help the parents, while the sister's lifestyle is lavish and funded by working-class parents. The sister has been arrested once before for domestic violence, and the author called the police again after threats involving knives. The parents are angry because they think the author ruined the sister's life.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's violent and abusive behavior, the threat to safety (knives, previous arrest), and the parents not taking action. The author felt they had to call the police to protect themselves and their family. Legally, if someone is in danger and the authorities are called to address violence or threats, that's a justified action. The parents might be upset about the consequences, but the author's priority was safety. The sister's refusal to seek help and continued harmful behavior supports the author's decision. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
