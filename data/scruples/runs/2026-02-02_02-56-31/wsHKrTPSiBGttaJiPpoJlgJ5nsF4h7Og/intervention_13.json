She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a 21-year-old sister with narcissistic and materialistic traits that have gotten worse after studying abroad. She yells a lot, is physically abusive, and the parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The user called the police twice, leading to the sister's arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset, feeling like the user ruined their daughter's life. The user is frustrated and wants her out of their lives.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the user's actions were justified. The sister is physically assaulting family members and threatening them with knives. The user reports this to the police because they fear for their safety. Legally, if someone is in immediate danger, calling the police is the right step. Domestic violence is a serious crime, and reporting it is a responsible action. The parents' enablement is a separate issue, but the user isn't responsible for the sister's behavior. The sister's refusal to seek help exacerbates the problem. The user's main concern is safety, so their action seems justified. However, the parents' anger adds complexity. But the question is about whether the user is in the wrong. Since they acted to protect themselves and their family from abuse, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). However, maybe there's a nuance if the user overstepped, but given the severity of the sister's actions, it's hard to see how calling the police is wrong. The sister already had a prior offense, so the user's action could prevent further harm. The parents' reaction might stem from their own issues with enabling, not the user's action. So, the answer is B.\n"
