She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. So first, I need to assess the situation based on the details provided.\n\nThe sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that's escalated since returning from university. She yells a lot, has thrown tantrums, and even physically assaulted their parents and possibly destroyed property. The user mentions that the sister was previously arrested for domestic violence, and this is her second offense. The user called the police again because they feared for their safety and their parents' well-being. The parents are upset because they feel the user ruined their sister's life.\n\nNow, legally, if someone is committing a crime, like domestic violence or assault, it's within the user's rights to call the police. The sister's actions are criminal, and reporting them isn't a personal attack but a legal duty to protect others. The parents' reaction might be due to cultural or family dynamics where they're protecting the child, but that doesn't make the user wrong for acting to stop abuse.\n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help and her ongoing abusive behavior justify the user's actions. The user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing safety and using legal means to address the situation. So the answer should be B.\n"
