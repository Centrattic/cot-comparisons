She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation is that the sister has been acting out, being abusive, and the parents are enabling her. The user felt they had to call the police because of the threats and physical violence.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister is 21, narcissistic, materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse. She yells a lot, threatens with knives, and has physically assaulted the parents. The user called the police a second time, leading to her arrest. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined her life. The user worked hard to avoid their parents' financial burden, while the sister's lifestyle was funded by the working-class parents.\n\nThe main question is whether the user is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the sister is committing crimes like domestic violence, assault, and threatening with a weapon, then calling the police is a responsible action. The user mentions fearing for their safety and their parents', which is a valid reason to involve authorities.\n\nThe parents might have a cultural or emotional perspective where family issues are handled internally, but the sister's actions are criminal. The user isn't just reporting a minor issue; it's about stopping violence. The sister already has a prior arrest, so there's a pattern of behavior.\n\nThe parents' anger could be because they feel the user is being harsh or that they should have handled it differently. However, the user's duty to protect themselves and their family from abuse is paramount. It's not about ruining a life but preventing further harm. The sister's refusal to seek help also adds to the justification.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). They acted to protect their family from a known abuser. The parents' perspective is understandable but doesn't outweigh the necessity to stop criminal behavior.\n"
