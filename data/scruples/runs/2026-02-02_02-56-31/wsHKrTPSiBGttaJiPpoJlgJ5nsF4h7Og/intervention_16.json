She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior: narcissistic, materialistic, yelling a lot, even physical assault on parents and property. The parents are working class and have given in to her demands because of her outbursts. The user worked hard for a full ride to college, so they're probably feeling resentful about the sister's lifestyle being funded by their parents.\n\nThe sister has been arrested before for domestic violence, and the user called the police again after she threatened them with knives. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined her life. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if someone is threatening violence or has a history of domestic violence, reporting them isn't wrong. The user was in fear for their safety and their parents', so calling the police is a reasonable step. The sister's actions are illegal, and the user is protecting themselves and their family.\n\nThe parents might be angry because they don't want to see their child in trouble, but that doesn't make the user's action wrong. The sister's refusal to seek help or change her behavior is a red flag. The user isn't the asshole here; they're standing up for their safety. Answer B.\n"
