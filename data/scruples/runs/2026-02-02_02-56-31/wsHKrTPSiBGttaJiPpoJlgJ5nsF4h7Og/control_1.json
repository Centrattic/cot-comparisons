She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, physical assaults, property damage, and domestic violence. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author called the police a second time because of the threats and fear for their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author had a legitimate fear for their safety, calling the police is a reasonable step. The police are supposed to handle domestic violence cases, and if there's a prior arrest, this could be a second offense, which might warrant further legal action. So legally, the author might be justified in seeking help to protect themselves and their family.\n\nThen, the parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. But the parents also didn't set boundaries, allowing the sister to act out. The sister's behavior is harmful, and the author is trying to protect the family. The sister's refusal to seek help makes the situation worse. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is in a difficult position. They're trying to stop abuse, which is their right. The sister is the one engaging in abusive behavior. The parents' anger is misplaced because the author is acting in self-defense and to protect others. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They took a necessary step to ensure safety, especially with a prior offense and ongoing threats. The sister's actions are the issue here, not the author's response to protect the household.\n"
