She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a lot of abuse and dysfunction in the family. The sister's behavior is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and escalating to physical violence, including threatening to use knives and actually hitting parents. The user mentions that their parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands during tantrums, and that they've tried to get help for the sister without success.\n\nSo, the key points here: the sister is violent, there's a history of domestic violence, the user called the police twice, and now the parents are upset with the user. The user is questioning whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is in immediate danger or there's a history of domestic violence, calling the police is a reasonable action. The user mentions that their sister was arrested before for domestic violence, so this is a second offense. Legally, reporting domestic violence is encouraged, especially if there's a threat to safety. The user's actions might be justified from a legal standpoint.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The user is trying to protect their family from abuse. The sister's behavior is harmful, and the parents aren't addressing it. The user's decision could be seen as a last resort to ensure safety. However, the parents are upset that the user \"ruined her life,\" which might reflect cultural or family values where protecting a child is prioritized over addressing abuse.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? If there's actual physical abuse and threats, then the user isn't wrong for seeking help from authorities. The parents' reaction might be due to their own priorities or not wanting to confront the reality of their daughter's actions. The sister's refusal to seek help and continue harmful behavior adds to the justification.\n\nHowever, sometimes in family conflicts, there can be nuances. Maybe the user didn't explore all possible avenues, but the prompt says they tried to get her help and she refused. The user's fear for their safety is valid. So overall, the user isn't in the wrong; they acted to protect themselves and their parents from abuse. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
