She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with escalating abusive behavior, both emotionally and physically. \n\nFirst, the sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, which has worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, is violent, and has attacked family members. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands to avoid the tantrums. The writer, who has worked hard for a full ride to college, is now taking action by calling the police for her second domestic violence offense. The parents are upset because they feel the writer ruined their sister's life.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's violent behavior, the risk to the family's safety, and the previous arrest. The author's action was based on fear for their and their parents' well-being. Legally, calling the police when someone is violent and poses a threat is justified. The parents might be upset, but the author is protecting the family from abuse. The sister's refusal to seek help and her history of violence support the author's decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
