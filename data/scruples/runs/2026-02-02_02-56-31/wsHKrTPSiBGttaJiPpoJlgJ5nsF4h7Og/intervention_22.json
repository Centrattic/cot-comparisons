She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, yelling, physical assault, and destruction of property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The user had to work hard for a full ride to college, while the sister's education was a financial burden. The sister has been arrested before for domestic violence and threatened to use knives, leading the family to not keep knives at home. The user called the police again, leading to the sister's second arrest, and now the parents are angry at the user.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user's actions were justified. The sister's behavior includes physical assault, which is a criminal offense. Domestic violence is a serious matter, and calling the police is a legitimate response to protect oneself and family. The sister's refusal to seek help and the parents' inability to set boundaries might be contributing to the cycle. The user's decision to involve law enforcement could be a necessary step to ensure safety. However, the parents' anger suggests there's family tension and maybe a cultural or personal belief that the user overstepped. But legally, if there's a threat of violence, calling the police isn't wrong. The user isn't the one committing violence; they're seeking help to stop it. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
