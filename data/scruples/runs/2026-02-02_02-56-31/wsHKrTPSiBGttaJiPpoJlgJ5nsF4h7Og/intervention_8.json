She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, now worse after being abroad. She yells a lot, is physically abusive, hit parents, destroyed property, threatened with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in during tantrums. The user worked hard for a full ride to college, while the sister's education was funded by the working-class parents. The sister was already arrested once for domestic violence, now the user called the police again.\n\nThe parents are angry at the user for \"ruining her life.\" The user fears for their safety and their parents'.\n\nLegal aspects: If someone is being physically abusive and threatens with weapons, calling the police is justified. Domestic violence is a crime, so reporting it isn't wrong. The sister's actions are criminal, so the user is acting in self-protection and for their family's safety.\n\nParental enablement: The parents caving in might contribute to the sister's behavior, but that doesn't make the user wrong for taking action. The user's responsibility isn't to enable abuse. The sister's refusal to seek help shows she's not addressing her issues, which is a red flag.\n\nEmotional aspect: The user is stressed, fearing for their safety. The parents are upset because they see their child's life being ruined, but the sister's actions are the root cause. The user isn't the one committing crimes here.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the user could have tried other means first, but given the sister's history and refusal to help, and the immediate danger, calling police is a necessary step. The user isn't in the wrong for protecting themselves and their family.\n\nSo, answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
