She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister. Let me break down the details. The sister is 21, came back from university, and her behavior has gotten worse. She's narcissistic, materialistic, yells a lot, and even physically attacks the parents. The user's parents keep giving in to her demands, which is causing a lot of stress. The user called the police twice, leading to her arrest for domestic violence. Now the parents are upset with the user for ruining her sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's actions. Physical assault and destroying property are serious. Domestic violence is a felony, so calling the police in that situation is a responsible action, especially if there's a history of it. The sister was already arrested once before, so this is a repeat offense. The user mentions fearing for their safety and their parents', so self-protection is a valid reason.\n\nBut the parents are upset because they think the user ruined their daughter's life. This might be a cultural or family dynamic issue. The parents may prioritize family over legal consequences, feeling that the legal system will harshly punish their daughter. The user, on the other hand, is trying to protect the family from ongoing abuse.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's criminal behavior and the user's intent to stop abuse. Legally, reporting domestic violence is not only right but encouraged. The user isn't in the wrong for seeking help from authorities to protect themselves and their family. The parents' disapproval doesn't make the user the asshole if the sister's actions are genuinely abusive and illegal.\n\nAlso, the sister refuses help, which means the situation isn't going to improve without external intervention. The user's actions are a last resort after other measures (like trying to get her to see a professional) failed. So, in this context, the user's choice to call the police is justified. Answer B makes sense here."
