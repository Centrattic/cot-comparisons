She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe sister is 21, came back from university in Australia, and her behavior has gotten worse. She's narcissistic, materialistic, yells a lot, and acts like a child when she doesn't get what she wants. The parents won't stand up to her, so she's getting everything she wants through tantrums. The sister has physically attacked the parents and destroyed property. The author has called the police twice, leading to the sister's arrest for domestic violence. Now the parents are angry with the author for ruining their daughter's life.\n\nFirst, the sister's actions clearly involve physical violence and threats, which are serious. The author mentions the sister has a history of domestic violence, with the second offense. The author's actions were to protect themselves and their parents, which seems justified. But the parents are upset because they don't want to ruin their daughter's life, maybe because they still love her and don't want her to go to jail or have a criminal record.\n\nIs there a legal aspect? If the sister was arrested for domestic violence, the author had a right to call the police when there was a threat to their safety. The sister's refusal to seek help or change her behavior adds to the problem. The author worked hard to get a full ride, while the parents worked hard to fund the sister's education. The sister's actions are causing harm and financial strain, which adds to the stress.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently? Like trying more interventions before calling the police? But given that the sister already has a prior arrest and continues to threaten with knives, and the author and parents are in fear, calling the police again seems necessary. The police are supposed to handle domestic violence situations, so the author isn't overstepping their role. The parents' anger might be because they feel the problem is being escalated too quickly, but the author is acting in self-defense.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking action to protect themselves and their family from abuse. The sister's behavior is inexcusable, and the author's actions were necessary to seek help from authorities. Answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
