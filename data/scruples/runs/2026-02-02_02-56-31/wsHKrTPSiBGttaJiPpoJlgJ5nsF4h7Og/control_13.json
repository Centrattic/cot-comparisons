She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, hits the parents, destroys property, and even threatened to attack them with knives. The parents are working class and already supported her expensive lifestyle. The author felt they had to call the police again because of the fear for their safety. The sister was previously arrested for domestic violence.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The key points here are the sister's physical assault on the parents, use of threats with knives, and repeated incidents. The author mentions fear for their well-being, which is a valid concern. Calling the police in such a case is typically a responsible action to ensure safety and address criminal behavior.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. But the sister's actions are criminal and potentially dangerous. The author might be standing up for their family's safety, which is a priority. The sister's refusal to seek help and her prior offenses also factor in. The author isn't just being petty; they're reacting to ongoing abuse and threats.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family matters should be handled internally. However, when there's physical violence and threats, especially with a history of domestic violence, involving law enforcement is appropriate. The author's past efforts to get her help (professional and medication) failed, so escalating the situation is understandable.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. Their actions are to protect themselves and their parents from harm. The sister's behavior is the real issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
