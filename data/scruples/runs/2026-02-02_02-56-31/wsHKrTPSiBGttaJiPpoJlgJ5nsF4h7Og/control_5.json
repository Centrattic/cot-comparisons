She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with a history of abusive behavior\u2014yelling, threatening with knives, physically assaulting parents, and refusing help. The parents are enabling her, and the author took action to have her arrested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is threatening violence, especially with weapons, and has a history of domestic violence, calling the police is a reasonable step. The police are there to protect people from harm. The author mentions that the sister has been arrested before, so this is a recurring issue.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to protect their family. The sister's behavior is harmful and dangerous. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which isn't helping her or the family. The author's frustration is understandable, especially given their own sacrifices and the sister's refusal to seek help.\n\nHowever, the parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life. But the sister's actions are already damaging her own life through her behavior. The author's intervention might be necessary for everyone's safety. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't in the wrong for seeking help when there's a clear threat. The sister's actions justify the call to the police. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
