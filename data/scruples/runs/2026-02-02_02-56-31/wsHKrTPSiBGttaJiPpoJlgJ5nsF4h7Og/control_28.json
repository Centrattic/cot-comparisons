She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves the sister being narcissistic and materialistic, with a history of screaming, threatening with knives, physically assaulting parents, and destroying property. The sister was previously arrested for domestic violence, and the author called the police again, leading to a second arrest. The parents are angry, thinking the author ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The key points here are the sister's behavior: she's causing harm through verbal abuse, threats, physical assault, and property damage. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author is protecting themselves and their parents by involving the police, which is a legal authority. \n\nIn legal terms, if someone is a victim of domestic violence or threats, they have the right to report it. The sister's actions meet the criteria for domestic violence, especially since she's attacking family members and threatening with weapons. The author called the police out of fear for their safety, which is a valid reason. The sister's refusal to seek help exacerbates the problem. \n\nHowever, the parents are upset because they feel the author is ruining their child's life. This might be due to cultural values or a desire to protect their daughter, even if her behavior is harmful. The author might be seen as taking the matter too far if the police response was excessive, but given the sister's history and the threats, it's a reasonable step. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's actions are clearly abusive and dangerous. The author's decision to report her could be seen as necessary to ensure safety, especially when the parents are unwilling to set boundaries. The sister has a history, so the author isn't overreacting but acting on a pattern. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're protecting themselves and their family from abuse and potential harm. Their actions are justified given the circumstances.\n"
