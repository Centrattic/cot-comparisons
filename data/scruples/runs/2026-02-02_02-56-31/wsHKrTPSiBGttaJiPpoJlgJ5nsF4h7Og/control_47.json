She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The person is asking if they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister. \n\nFirst, the sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, screams when she doesn't get her way, and even physically assaults the parents and damages property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and they're upset with the author for calling the police.\n\nSo, the author called the police twice now because of the sister's violent behavior. The sister has a history of domestic violence, including threatening to use knives, and the family doesn't keep knives anymore because of that. The parents think the author ruined their sister's life by getting her arrested again.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about self-defense and the safety of the family. If someone is being violent and threatening, calling the police is a reasonable step to protect oneself and others. The sister's actions\u2014like physically assaulting parents and threatening with knives\u2014seem like clear signs of domestic abuse. The author mentions fearing for their well-being, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement.\n\nThe parents might be in denial or in denial about the severity of the situation, but the author's action is about stopping abuse. The sister's refusal to get help and the prior arrest indicate a pattern of behavior that's not going to change without intervention. The author's motivation is to protect their family, which is understandable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're taking action against abuse, which is a serious issue. The answer should be B (No).\n"
