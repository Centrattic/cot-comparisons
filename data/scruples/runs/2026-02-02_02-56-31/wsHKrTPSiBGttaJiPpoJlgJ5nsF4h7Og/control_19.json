She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe sister is 21, returned from university abroad. She's described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that's gotten worse. She yells a lot, screams when she doesn't get her way, and even physically assaults the parents and destroys property. The parents keep giving in to her demands. The author mentions that their sister has already been arrested once for domestic violence and this is the second offense. The author called the police again because they feared for their safety, and now the parents are angry at them for ruining the sister's life.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's aggressive and violent behavior, including physical assault. The author's actions were to involve the police to protect themselves and their parents. The parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their child's life. But the author is prioritizing their safety.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, legally, if someone is a threat to others, calling the police is appropriate. The sister's actions are criminal\u2014domestic violence and property destruction. The author is protecting their family, which is a valid concern. The parents might have their own issues enabling the sister, but the author isn't responsible for that. The sister's refusal to seek help doesn't help either.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would be B (No) because they acted to prevent harm. Even though family dynamics are complex, the immediate safety of oneself and family members is a priority.\n"
