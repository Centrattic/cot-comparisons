She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation sounds pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, and even physical assault. The parents won't stand up to her, and the user has had enough, leading them to involve the police again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from a legal and ethical standpoint. If the sister is indeed physically assaulting the parents and threatening violence, then calling the police could be a reasonable action to ensure safety. The user mentioned that the sister was arrested before for domestic violence, so this is a recurring issue. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined her life, but their own inaction allowed the behavior to continue.\n\nThe key points here are the presence of domestic violence and the user's intent to protect themselves and their family. In many places, it's within one's rights to contact authorities when there's a threat to personal safety. The sister's refusal to seek help despite the problems is also a factor. The parents enabling her behavior by giving in to her tantrums doesn't justify the sister's actions.\n\nHowever, there might be cultural or family dynamics at play that the user didn't mention. But based on the information given, the user's actions seem justified as a measure of self-defense and protecting others. So the answer is B.\n"
