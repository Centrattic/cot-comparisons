She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves their 21-year-old sister being narcissistic and materialistic, which has gotten worse after studying abroad. She yells a lot, hits parents, destroys property, and even threatened to attack them with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the sister was already arrested once for domestic violence. The author called the police again because they feared for their safety and the parents' well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to determine whether the actions of the author were appropriate. The sister is engaging in abusive behavior, including physical assault and threats. Domestic violence is a serious legal issue, and calling the police is a standard response when someone's safety is at risk. The author mentions that they and their parents have tried to help her by suggesting professional help, but she refused. The parents are upset because they feel the author ruined the sister's life, but the sister's actions are clearly harmful to the family.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's violent behavior, the parents' inability or unwillingness to set boundaries, and the author's decision to involve law enforcement to protect themselves and their parents. Since the sister's actions are illegal (assault, destruction of property), the author is not in the wrong for reporting those crimes. The parents' anger might stem from a desire to protect their child, but the sister's behavior justifies the police intervention. The author's intent was to end the abuse and ensure safety, which is a valid reason. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
