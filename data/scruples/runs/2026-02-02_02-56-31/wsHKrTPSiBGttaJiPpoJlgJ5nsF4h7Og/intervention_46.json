She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their sister who's acting out, and they called the police on her again. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe sister is 21, came back from studying in Australia. She's been narcissistic and materialistic, and it's gotten worse. She yells a lot, even for small things. The user is disturbed by the constant yelling. Parents won't say no, which probably enables her behavior. She's even physically assaulted parents and threatened with knives. The user had her arrested before, and now again because of fear. Parents are upset with the user for ruining her life.\n\nSo the user's main points: they're protecting themselves and their parents from abuse. The sister's actions are violent, and they're calling the police to stop it. The parents, however, are upset with the user for taking that action.\n\nLegally, if someone is a threat to safety, calling the police is justified. Domestic violence is a crime, and reporting it is the right thing. The sister has a history of this, so the user isn't overreacting. The parents' reaction might be due to stress or wanting to protect their child, but the user is in a dangerous situation.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the user could've handled it another way? But if the sister is violent and unresponsive to other help, police intervention is necessary. The parents not wanting to take action doesn't make the user's action wrong. The user's safety is paramount.\n\nSo the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong. They're protecting others from abuse.\n"
