She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of aggressive behavior, including yelling, threatening with knives, and physical assault. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and they're upset with the user for involving the police again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the sister has already been arrested once for domestic violence and this is a second offense, then calling the police again when there's a threat or actual assault isn't wrong. The law is there to protect people from harm. The user mentioned fearing for their own and their parents' well-being, so self-defense and protecting family members is a valid reason to call the police.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The parents might feel that the user is causing harm to their child, but the sister's behavior is abusive and dangerous. The parents enabling her by giving in to her demands isn't healthy either. The user's action, while it might strain family relations, is about safety and stopping abuse.\n\nThe sister refusing help and escalating the situation makes the user's decision more understandable. The user's parents' anger might come from a place of favoring their child over the well-being of the whole family. However, the user isn't the one committing offenses; they're taking steps to protect everyone.\n\nSo, considering the facts, the user isn't in the wrong. They're acting to prevent further abuse and ensure safety. Answer B.\n"
