She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let's go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, which has gotten worse after studying abroad. She yells a lot, is aggressive, and even physically assaults her parents. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands during tantrums. The author mentions that the sister was already arrested once for domestic violence and is now facing a second offense. The author called the police again because they feared for their safety, and now the parents are upset with them.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if someone is engaging in domestic violence, including physical assault and threats with weapons, calling the police is a reasonable action to ensure safety. The sister's behavior is criminal, and the author is reporting a crime. The parents might feel that the author is causing harm to their child, but the sister's actions are illegal and dangerous. The author isn't just making a personal choice here; they're involving law enforcement to stop a known offender who has already been arrested once. \n\nThe parents' reaction could be due to cultural or family dynamics where they might prioritize protecting their child over addressing the criminal behavior. However, the author's actions are in self-defense and to protect their family from further harm. Since the sister has a history and the author has legitimate fears, it's a matter of public safety. \n\nI don't see any indication that the author exaggerated the situation or made false reports. The sister's actions are documented (previous arrest, threats, property damage, physical assault). So legally and morally, the author is justified in reporting the sister to protect themselves and their parents. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
