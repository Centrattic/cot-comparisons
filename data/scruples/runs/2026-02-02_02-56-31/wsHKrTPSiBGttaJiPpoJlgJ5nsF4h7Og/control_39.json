She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissism, materialism, and escalating behavior\u2014screaming, yelling, physical assaults on parents, destroying property, and even threatening to use knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands during tantrums. The user called the police twice, leading to her arrest for domestic violence, and now the parents are upset.\n\nFirst, the sister's actions: physical assault and threats are serious. Domestic violence is a crime, so reporting it isn't just about conflict resolution but safety. The user mentions fearing for their safety and their parents', which is a valid reason to involve authorities. The sister was already arrested once, so this is a repeat offense. The parents might be in denial or prioritizing their child's feelings over their own safety. \n\nThe user's actions: calling the police in response to ongoing abuse is a responsible action. They\u2019re trying to protect their family. The sister's refusal to seek help and continued harmful behavior makes the situation more dire. The parents being angry might stem from cultural factors or denial of the problem, but that doesn't make the user wrong for acting in self-defense and to protect others. \n\nThe key points are the sister's criminal behavior, the user's reasonable fear, and the necessity of police involvement. The answer should be B (not in the wrong) because the user was protecting their family from abuse.\n"
