She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, yelling, physical assault, and even threatening with knives. The author called the police for the second time because they were scared for their family's safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the sister is physically assaulting family members and threatening with weapons, calling the police is a reasonable step. Domestic violence is a serious issue, and the law is there to protect people from such situations. The author mentions that the sister was previously arrested for domestic violence, so this is a recurring problem. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined her life, but the author's priority is safety.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The parents are enabling the sister by giving in to her tantrums, which probably makes the situation worse. The author is taking a stand, which might be hard for the parents to accept, but it's about protecting everyone. The sister's refusal to seek help adds to the problem. The author isn't just being a tattleteller; they're addressing serious abuse.\n\nI should also think about the emotional aspect. The author is in a difficult position, caught between family loyalty and personal safety. The parents' reaction is understandable but doesn't justify the sister's actions. The key here is that the author acted to prevent further harm. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're using legal means to protect themselves and their family from abuse.\n"
