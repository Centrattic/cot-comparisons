She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that's gotten worse after studying abroad. She yells a lot, is physically abusive to the parents, and has threatened to use knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author called the police a second time because they were scared for their safety. The sister was previously arrested for domestic violence, and now the parents are upset with the author for ruining her life.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's abusive behavior and the author's attempt to get help. The parents are not protecting the author from the sister's violence. The author felt they had to involve the police to ensure safety. In many places, calling the police to report domestic violence is not only a right but a responsibility, especially when there's a history of abuse and threats. The sister's actions are criminal, and the author is taking steps to protect themselves and their family. The parents' anger seems misplaced because the sister is the one committing crimes. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
