She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the sister is 21, returned from university in Australia, and her behavior has gotten worse. She yells a lot, is narcissistic, materialistic, and now physically assaults the parents. The user mentions that the parents are working class and worked hard to fund her education, which the user managed a full ride to avoid debt. The sister has been arrested once before for domestic violence, and this is the second offense. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined her life, but the user is trying to protect themselves and their parents from harm.\n\nSo, the user's action was calling the police again. The key points here are about self-protection and the safety of family members. The sister's behavior includes physical assault and property destruction, which are serious. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which is not appropriate, especially if she has a history of violence.\n\nIn terms of the user's perspective, they were acting to prevent further harm. The sister has already been arrested before, so there's a pattern here. The user isn't just handling this through family means anymore; they took a legal step. The parents are angry, but their enabling might be part of the problem. The user worked hard to avoid burdening their parents, so they have a valid concern here.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, if someone is in danger, calling the police is a responsible action. The sister's actions are criminal (domestic violence), so reporting them isn't just a family matter anymore. The user might be seen as standing up for their parents and themselves, especially if they've tried other methods like getting her to see a professional. The sister's refusal to seek help adds to the justification for intervention.\n\nHowever, the parents' reaction suggests there might be cultural or emotional factors at play. Maybe they see the sister's behavior as a phase, or feel protective. But the user's priority should be safety. It's possible the parents are in denial about the severity of the situation. The user's action could be necessary to get the sister to face consequences and for the family to get support.\n\nSo, the user isn't the asshole here. They took a step to protect their loved ones from a dangerous situation. The sister's actions are the problem, and the parents' enablement is also an issue. The user made a tough choice to involve authorities, which is the right thing to do when there's a threat of violence.\n"
