She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister due to her aggressive and abusive behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and having worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, is physically abusive towards the parents, and there's a history of domestic violence. The author called the police a second time because of the threats and incidents, which led to the sister's arrest. The parents are upset with the author, and the sister refuses help. The author is considering cutting ties.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal perspective, if someone is in a situation where there's domestic abuse and threats, calling the police is a reasonable and responsible action. The sister has a prior arrest for domestic violence, so the author is following up on a pattern. The author mentions fearing for their safety and their parents', which is a valid reason to contact authorities.\n\nThe parents disapprove because they feel the author ruined the sister's life, but the sister's actions are the root cause. The author is trying to protect the family from ongoing harm. The sister's refusal to seek help exacerbates the situation, making the author's actions more justified.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the author could have tried other methods first, but given the severity of the abuse and the prior incident, waiting might put the family at greater risk. The author has a right to self-defense and to ensure their family's safety. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they're taking necessary steps against abuse.\n"
