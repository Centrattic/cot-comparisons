She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies, who has become more aggressive after returning from university. She's been yelling a lot, physically assaulting family members, and even threatening to use knives. The author called the police again because they were scared for their safety and their parents' well-being. The parents are upset, thinking the author ruined the sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if calling the police was the right action. The sister's behavior includes physical assault and threats, which are criminal offenses. Domestic violence is taken seriously by law enforcement, so reporting it isn't necessarily wrong. The author mentions a previous arrest, so it's a repeat offense. The parents might feel protective, but the author's safety is a priority. \n\nHowever, there's a cultural or family dynamic aspect here. The parents might value family harmony over legal action, leading to conflict. The sister's mental health could be a factor, but she refuses help. The author's actions were to protect themselves and their parents, which is reasonable. \n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. In AITA contexts, the focus is on the actions and their justification. Since the sister's behavior is abusive and criminal, the author's response seems appropriate. The parents being upset is a consequence but doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
