She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, especially after returning from university in Australia. She yells a lot, is aggressive, and even physically assaults their parents. The parents are working class and have given in to her demands every time she throws a tantrum. The person in question called the police on her twice because of the threats and physical violence, including a previous arrest for domestic violence. Now the parents are upset with them for ruining their sister's life. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wanting to get her out of their lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and morality here. If there's a threat of violence, especially with weapons, and the sibling has a history of domestic violence, calling the police is a reasonable step to ensure safety. The person mentions that the sister threatened to attack them with knives, so they don't even keep knives in the house anymore. That's a clear danger.\n\nThe parents' perspective is important too. They might feel protective of their child and see the call to the police as harsh. But their enabling behavior by giving in to every tantrum might have contributed to the sister's continued bad behavior. The person in question is acting out of fear for their safety and their parents' well-being. They have a right to protect themselves from abuse.\n\nThe sister refusing help and being uncooperative is also a factor. If she's not willing to seek professional help, then the family's attempts to help her are ineffective. The person's action was to stop the abuse, not just to get her out of their lives, which might be a different issue. So, is the person in the wrong? It seems like they were acting in self-defense and to protect their family from a dangerous situation. The parents' anger is about the consequences for their sister, but the priority should be safety. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
