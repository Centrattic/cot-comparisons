She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nTheir sister is 21, came back from university in Australia, and has been acting more narcissistic and materialistic. She yells a lot at them, hits the parents, and destroyed property. The parents are working class and funded her university, which the user managed a full ride to. The sister was already arrested once for domestic violence and this is the second time. The user called the police again, leading to her arrest, and now the parents are angry at them for ruining the sister's life. The user is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user did the right thing by contacting the police. If their sister is physically assaulting their parents and threatening with knives, that's domestic violence. Even if the family is close, the law typically protects individuals from such threats. The user's action might be justified to protect their parents and themselves.\n\nThe sister's behavior is escalating and dangerous. The user mentioned fear for their well-being. In cases of domestic violence, calling the police is a common and advised step to ensure safety. The sister's refusal to seek help despite previous arrests makes the situation more serious. The parents might feel caught between protecting their child and the consequences of her actions, leading to their anger.\n\nHowever, the parents think the user ruined the sister's life. That's a conflict here. The user might have family tensions. But the user's priority is safety. It's possible the parents don't fully grasp the severity or are in denial. The user's right to protect themselves and their family from harm is a key point. In most legal and ethical frameworks, reporting crimes, especially domestic violence, is right. So the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
