She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of narcissistic and materialistic behavior that's gotten worse after studying abroad. She's been screaming, yelling, being aggressive, and even physically assaulted the parents. The user mentions that the sister threatened to use knives, so they removed all knives from the house. They called the police twice, leading to an arrest for domestic violence. Now the parents are angry at the user for ruining their sister's life.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's abusive behavior, the threat to safety, and the user taking action by calling the police. The parents are upset, but the user is protecting themselves and the parents from ongoing abuse. Legally, if someone is in danger and they call the police to stop domestic violence, that's a justified action. The sister's actions are criminal, and reporting them isn't being an asshole. The parents might be prioritizing their child's happiness over safety, but the user is acting in self-defense and to protect their family. The sister's refusal to seek help also plays a role here. The user isn't in the wrong; they're taking necessary steps to stop abuse. Answer B."
