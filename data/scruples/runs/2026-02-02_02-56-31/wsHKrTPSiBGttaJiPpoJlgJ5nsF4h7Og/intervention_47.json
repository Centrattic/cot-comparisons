She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the user is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user has a 21-year-old sister who's been acting really poorly, especially after returning from university in Australia. She's described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a tendency to throw screaming fits when she doesn't get her way. The sister yells at the user for minor things like leaving the door open. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. There's also mention of physical abuse towards the parents and threats with knives, leading the user to call the police twice. The sister was arrested once before, and this is the second offense. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined their daughter's life. The user is asking if they're the asshole for wanting her out of their lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister is physically assaulting the parents and making threats with knives, then calling the police would be a reasonable response. Domestic violence is a criminal matter, and reporting it is the right thing to do. The user mentions that the sister was already arrested once for domestic violence, so this is a repeat offense. The user's fear for their safety and their parents' safety is valid here. \n\nNext, the emotional and family dynamics. The parents are enabling the sister by giving in to her tantrums, which might be part of the problem. The user, feeling unsafe and seeing the parents being abused, took action by calling the police. The parents are upset because they might see their child being arrested as a betrayal, but the user's primary responsibility is their own safety and their parents' safety. \n\nThe sister's behavior is clearly problematic. She's acting out, refusing help, and escalating to violence. The user's actions were to protect themselves and their parents, which is a legitimate reason to involve law enforcement. \n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect to consider. In some cultures, family matters are handled internally, and involving the police might be seen as extreme. The parents might come from a background where they prioritize family unity over legal intervention, which could explain their anger. But the user's right to safety should override that, especially when there's a history of violence and threats. \n\nThe user also mentions working hard to get a full ride to college to avoid burdening their parents, which shows they've made sacrifices. The sister's behavior is not only affecting the user's well-being but also the parents' financial and emotional health. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the user acted to stop domestic violence and protect their family. Legally, they were justified. Emotionally, it's a family conflict, but the safety of individuals is paramount. The sister's actions are criminal, so reporting them isn't being an asshole; it's the responsible thing to do. The parents' anger is about the consequences for their daughter, but the user isn't at fault here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
