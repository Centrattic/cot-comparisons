She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation is pretty intense. The sister is 21, came back from university, and has a bad temper, yells a lot, and even physically attacks the parents. The user had to call the police twice, and the parents are upset because they think the user ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a history of aggressive behavior, including physical assault and destruction of property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums, which is causing financial strain. The user is trying to protect their family from abuse. The sister was already arrested once for domestic violence, now it's the second time.\n\nLegally, if someone is in immediate danger, calling the police is the right thing to do. The user mentions fearing for their safety and their parents'. The sister's refusal to seek help or change her behavior makes it a recurring issue. The parents' anger is because they might feel protective or don't want to face the consequences for their daughter. But the user's actions are to prevent further harm.\n\nThe user's actions seem justified because they're taking steps to ensure their safety and their family's. The sister's behavior is escalating and dangerous. The parents not addressing the problem is part of the issue. The user isn't the asshole here; they're trying to stop abuse. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
