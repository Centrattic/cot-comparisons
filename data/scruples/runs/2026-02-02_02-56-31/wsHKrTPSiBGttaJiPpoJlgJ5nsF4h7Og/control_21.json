She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, physical abuse, and even threatening with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which is causing the author a lot of stress and fear. The author called the police twice, leading to her sister's arrest for domestic violence. Now, the parents are upset because they think the author ruined her sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is physically assaulting family members and threatening with weapons, calling the police is a reasonable step to ensure safety. The author mentions fearing for their and their parents' well-being, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement. The sister was already arrested once before, so this is a pattern of abusive behavior. The parents might be in denial or too protective, but they can't be the sole protectors if there's a legal issue happening. \n\nThen there's the emotional and psychological aspect. The sister's behavior is extreme, and the author is trying to protect the family from harm. The sister refuses help, which complicates things. The author's actions are motivated by concern for safety, not just annoyance. \n\nBut some might argue that the author is overreacting or causing unnecessary conflict by involving the police. However, given the severity of the sister's actions\u2014physical assault, threats, and property damage\u2014it seems justified. The parents' anger could stem from cultural expectations or fear of family shame, but the author's safety should come first. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is likely not in the wrong. The sister's actions are the main issue here, and the author is taking steps to protect themselves and their family from ongoing abuse.\n"
