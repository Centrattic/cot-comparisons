She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation is that their 21-year-old sister is acting very narcissistic and materialistic, especially after returning from university in Australia. She yells a lot, hits their parents, destroys property, and even threatened to attack them with knives. The parents keep giving in to her outbursts, and the user has called the police twice now, leading to the sister's second arrest. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined her life. The user wants to get her out of their lives and is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister is being physically abusive towards the parents, which is a serious issue. The user is taking action by involving the police, which is typically the right step when someone is in danger. However, the parents are upset, possibly because they don't want to take sides or face the consequences of the sister's actions. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). So, the user is justifying their action by the sister's violent behavior and the parents' inability or unwillingness to set boundaries. \n\nIn such cases, the law usually protects against domestic violence. If the sister is indeed hitting them and threatening with weapons, the user has a responsibility to protect their family. Calling the police is not an action taken lightly in these situations. The parents' reaction might stem from fear, shame, or cultural factors where family reputation is important. But that doesn't make the user wrong for seeking help. \n\nAdditionally, the sister's refusal to seek professional help is a red flag. The user is trying to intervene for their parents' safety, which is a valid concern. The user's own efforts to avoid burdening their parents with college debt might add to their frustration. \n\nI should consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if the user had a history of conflict, but the main issue here is the sister's violence. The police are supposed to handle domestic violence cases, so the user's action is appropriate. The parents being angry could be because they feel betrayed or don't want to lose their child, but the user is not responsible for the sister's behavior. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), because the user is acting to protect their family from serious harm, which is a responsible and justified action.\n"
