She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister for repeated abuse and threats.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a history of screaming, yelling, and even physical violence, including hitting parents and threatening them with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author called the police twice, leading to the sister's second arrest for domestic violence. Now, the parents are upset with the author, thinking they ruined the sister's life.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer A says yes, B says no. I need to consider legal, ethical, and familial perspectives.\n\nLegally, if the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author has a reasonable fear for their safety, calling the police could be justified. The sister's actions, like threatening with knives and physical assault, are criminal. The author mentions the sister was already arrested once, so this is a repeat offense. In many places, reporting domestic violence is not only allowed but encouraged to protect victims and prevent further harm.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect themselves and their parents from abuse. The sister's behavior is abusive and dangerous. The parents are enabling her, but the author is taking a stand. The sister has refused help, so the author's actions might be necessary to ensure safety.\n\nFamilially, this is a tough spot. Parents might feel that the author is causing harm by getting the sister arrested, but the alternative is living in a dangerous environment. The author's decision could be seen as a last resort to protect the family.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried more non-confrontational methods first, but the sister refused help. Also, the parents' anger is a factor, but their enabling behavior allowed the sister's abuse to continue. The author might be in the right to prioritize safety over family harmony in this case.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong because they are addressing threats to safety, which is a valid reason to involve authorities. The sister's actions are criminal, and the author is taking responsibility to protect their family. Answer B.\n"
