She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a sister who's been acting out, being really aggressive, yelling a lot, even physically assaulting their parents. The parents won't stand up to her, and the author finally called the police again because they were scared for their safety. The sister has a history of domestic violence, and this is the second time she's been arrested. Now the parents are angry at the author for ruining their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The sister is hitting the parents and threatening them with knives. That's domestic violence, which is a criminal offense. The author called the police to protect their family, which seems like a reasonable response when there's a threat of violence. The parents are working class and have been funding her education, but she's not showing any respect or control. The author worked hard to get a full ride, so maybe they feel the family's sacrifices are being abused.\n\nBut the parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. However, the sister's behavior is already causing harm. If the sister is violent, then the author's action was to prevent further harm. It's not just about the sister's life but the safety of the whole family. The sister refuses help, so the situation is escalating. The author felt the need to involve the police, which is the proper channel for such threats. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried other avenues first, but the sister has a history of violent behavior. If the police were called once before and it didn't change her behavior, then a second time might be necessary. The key here is whether the author acted in self-defense and to protect others from harm. In legal terms, if there's a credible threat, calling the police is justified. The parents' anger might come from a place of trying to protect their child, but if the child is the abuser, that's a different dynamic. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions were to prevent further abuse and protect their family. The sister's behavior is the issue here, not the author's attempt to seek help through the police.\n"
