She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that's getting worse since returning from university. She yells a lot, especially at the user, and the parents keep giving in to her demands. The sister has physically assaulted the parents and threatened to use knives, which is a serious issue. The user had her arrested before for domestic violence, and now they did it again. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined their sister's life.\n\nThe user's main concern is their safety and their parents' well-being. They worked hard to get a full ride to college to avoid burdening their parents, but the sister's behavior is causing stress and fear. The sister refuses help, claiming everything's her fault. The user wants to remove her from their lives and is wondering if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and property destruction, calling the police is a reasonable step to protect oneself and family. The parents might be in denial or prioritizing their child's feelings over safety. The user's actions are about self-defense and preventing further harm. Since the sister is an adult and has previously been arrested, the user isn't necessarily overstepping; they're using legal means to address a clear threat. The answer should be B (No), as the user is justified in protecting their family.\n"
