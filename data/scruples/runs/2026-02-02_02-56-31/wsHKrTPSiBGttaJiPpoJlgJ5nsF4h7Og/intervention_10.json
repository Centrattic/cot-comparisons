She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister who's been acting out, being narcissistic, yelling a lot, and even physically assaulting her parents. The person in question called the police on her sister for domestic violence, and now their parents are upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister is indeed engaging in domestic violence, like hitting the parents and threatening with knives, then calling the police might be a justified action. Domestic violence is a criminal offense, so reporting it isn't wrong. Especially if there's a history of such incidents, like a previous arrest, then the situation could be escalating. The person might be trying to protect their family by taking legal action.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are upset because they think the sister's life is ruined. They might be in denial about her behavior or feel that the family should handle it internally. The parents might not want to involve the police because of shame or fear of legal consequences for their daughter. However, their inaction could be enabling the sister's abusive behavior. \n\nThe person's motivation is self-protection and the safety of their parents. They mention that the sister has destroyed their home life, forced them to remove knives, and caused constant fear. In such a case, seeking external help through the police is reasonable. The sister's refusal to get help or take responsibility might make the situation more desperate, so the person's actions could be seen as necessary to stop further harm.\n\nBut there might be cultural or family dynamics at play. Some families prioritize keeping matters in-house, which could explain the parents' anger. However, the person isn't the one committing the violence; they're the one taking a stand against it. So legally and ethically, they might be in the right. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because they're reporting a crime to protect others.\n"
