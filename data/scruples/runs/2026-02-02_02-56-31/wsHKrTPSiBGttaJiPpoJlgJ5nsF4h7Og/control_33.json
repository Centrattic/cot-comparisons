She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user describes their sister as narcissistic and materialistic, and this has gotten worse after she studied abroad. She yells a lot, is aggressive, and even physically assaults family members. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands after her tantrums. The sister has been arrested before for domestic violence and now the user called the police again. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined their daughter's life. The user is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's behavior. Physical assault, destruction of property, threatening with knives\u2014these are serious issues. The sister has a history of domestic violence and hasn't sought help despite the family's efforts. The user acted out of concern for their safety and their parents' well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are upset, possibly because they don't want their daughter to face legal consequences. The user's action might have seemed harsh, but it's in response to ongoing abuse. Legally, calling the police when someone is threatening or attacking you is justified. The user mentions fearing for their safety, which is a strong reason to involve authorities.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? They took action to protect themselves and their family. The sister's behavior is the root problem here. The parents might have different views on how to handle it, but the user isn't obligated to enable harmful behavior. The answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
