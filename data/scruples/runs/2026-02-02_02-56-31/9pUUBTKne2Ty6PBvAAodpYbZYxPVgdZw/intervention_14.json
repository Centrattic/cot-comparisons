  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person here is in a tricky situation. They had a relationship with someone they met at a wedding, who turned out to be married and in a closeted same-sex relationship. Now they're questioning whether exposing the cheater is the right move, even though it might out him.\n\nFirst, they had consensual relationships with the man, who was married. So from a legal standpoint, the person isn't breaking any laws here. But morally, they're conflicted because they know the husband is cheating. They want to inform the wife but don't want to out him because of his family's potential reaction. \n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. Let's break it down. The man is in a committed marriage but has been unfaithful. The person here didn't know about the marriage when they started the relationship. They even respected his privacy by not outing him when he asked. Now that they know he's cheating, they feel a duty to inform the wife. \n\nBut there's a conflict here between the duty to the wife and the privacy of the husband. If they tell the wife, they might be exposing the husband's sexuality to his potentially unsupportive family. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. \n\nThe person isn't at fault for the affair because they didn't know the husband was married. They were honest about keeping his secrets. The dilemma is whether to prioritize the wife's right to know or the husband's privacy. Neither choice is straightforward. If they choose to tell the wife, they might be helping her but outing the husband. If they don't, they might be enabling the cheating. \n\nSo, are they in the wrong? If they decide to tell the wife, they might be seen as interfering but trying to do the right thing. If they don't, they might be protecting the husband but letting the infidelity continue. Since they didn't know the husband was married initially, they aren't at fault for the affair. The main issue is the moral dilemma, not their actions leading up to it. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong for their initial actions, but the situation is complex.\n"
