  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing someone who cheated and is in a heterosexual marriage while being closeted. They had an affair with the husband, found out he's married, and now want to tell the wife but worry about outing him as gay, which could cause family issues.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: they slept with a married man. That's cheating, so from a moral standpoint, they might feel guilty. But their question is about whether they're wrong for exposing him. \n\nThe key points are the cheater's closeted status and the user's dilemma about outing him versus protecting the wife. The user is conflicted between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy. \n\nIf the user tells the wife, it would out him as gay, which could lead to family problems. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, the user's main question is whether they're wrong for exposing him even if it means outing him. \n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but the user's moral stance is that they feel obligated to tell the wife. But how do they reconcile that with outing him? Also, the user is the one who had the affair, so maybe they're in the wrong for being part of the cheating. \n\nBut the user's main action is considering exposing the cheater. If they do it in a way that out him, they might be violating his privacy. However, if the wife deserves to know, maybe it's justified. The user is trying to do the right thing but is conflicted. \n\nSo, the user's question is whether they are in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. The answer depends on whether they acted wrongfully in the affair first. Since they were part of the cheating, they might share some responsibility. But if they're trying to inform the wife, that's a different aspect. \n\nIn terms of the options, A is \"Yes, I am in the wrong.\" B is \"No.\" The user is asking if their planned action makes them wrong. Considering they were part of the infidelity, they might be at fault. However, the dilemma is about exposing the cheater. If they do it anonymously, maybe that's better. But the user is unsure. \n\nThe user might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but their own actions (cheating) could be seen as their fault. The question is specifically about exposing the cheater, so maybe the answer is B (No), but the user's own actions (cheating) are where they're in the wrong. However, the question is whether the exposure makes them wrong. \n\nIn moral terms, outing someone without their consent is a violation of privacy. Since the user was complicit in the affair, they might not have the right to out him. So, the user might be in the wrong for exposing him. Alternatively, the wife's right to know is a competing interest. \n\nThis is a tough call. The user's main action is the exposure. If they out him by telling the wife, they're violating his privacy. Even if the wife should know, the method of informing her would be problematic. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for that action. So answer A.\n"
