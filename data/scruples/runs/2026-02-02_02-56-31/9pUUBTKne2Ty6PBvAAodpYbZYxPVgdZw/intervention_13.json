  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person in question had an affair with someone who is married and in the closet. They were told not to reveal anything, but later found out the man is married. Now they're conflicted about whether to expose him, which would out him, or protect him.\n\nFirst, the ethical dilemma here is between the right of the wife to know she's been cheated on and the man's right to his privacy regarding his sexuality. The person might feel guilty because they had an affair themselves, but they also understand the harm of infidelity. \n\nThe user is considering exposing the cheater, which would mean outing him as gay. There's a risk of family conflict if the parents find out, but the wife has a right to know. However, the user might not be the best person to inform the wife, as it's a third party. They could be seen as overstepping if they don't have a direct relationship with the wife. \n\nAlso, the user's own actions in the affair could be seen as contributing to the problem. They might be trying to justify their actions by exposing him, but it's a complex situation. Legally, they might not have a duty to inform the wife, but morally, they might feel a responsibility. \n\nThe key points are confidentiality vs. the duty to warn. If there's a way to inform the wife without outing him publicly, maybe through a private conversation where the identity is revealed but the context of his sexuality is handled carefully, that could be an option. But if outing is the only way, the user might be causing more harm than good, especially if the parents are unsupportive. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the user's actions in the affair are questionable, but the decision to expose the cheater is a separate issue. They might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but they could be overstepping by taking it upon themselves. The answer hinges on whether their actions to inform the wife are justified despite the potential consequences.\n"
