I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having an affair with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. The author is conflicted about whether to expose the man's infidelity to his wife, which would also out him as gay, potentially causing family issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author slept with someone who's married and having children. The man is also gay and wants to stay closeted. The author knows he's cheating, possibly with others via Grindr. The dilemma is whether to tell the wife, which would out him, or stay silent.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's actions: They had a sexual relationship with someone who is married without the spouse's knowledge. The man is cheating, but the author didn't know he was married initially. Wait, the author found out later that he's married. So, the affair was consensual between the author and the married man, but the author didn't know about the marriage until after multiple encounters. \n\nThe author is now considering exposing the man's infidelity to his wife, which would out him as gay. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do that. \n\nSo, the author is in a complicated position. On one hand, he's involved in an affair, which is a betrayal of the married man's spouse. On the other hand, he's trying to inform the spouse of the infidelity, which is a moral action, but it also out the man as gay against his wishes. \n\nBut wait, the author is the one who had the affair without the spouse's knowledge. So, the author is part of the cheating. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to expose the man's infidelity. \n\nThe author's own actions (cheating) are wrong, but the question is whether they are in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater (which would reveal his infidelity but also his sexuality). However, the author's own complicity in the cheating may make them complicit in the betrayal. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The main issue here is whether the author's potential action of informing the wife is wrong, considering the consequences for the man's privacy and family.\n\nIf the author is considering coming forward, but they themselves are also part of the problem (having engaged in the affair), that might make them complicit. However, the act of informing the wife could be seen as a moral duty to the wife, even if it upsets the man's family. \n\nBut the author's own actions (cheating) are wrong, so they are in the wrong in that aspect. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, which is a separate action. \n\nIn most cases, cheating is always wrong, but here the author is trying to correct their mistake by informing the wife. However, their own actions complicate their moral standing. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they were involved in an affair without the spouse's knowledge, making them complicit. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong in the situation of considering exposing the cheater. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though their own actions were wrong. But the act of exposing someone else's affair while being part of it is tricky. \n\nBut in WIBTA scenarios, the user is usually asking if they are in the wrong for their own actions. In this case, the main action is the author's participation in the affair. The question is whether they are in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater. However, the initial act of cheating is the main issue here. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the entire situation. Since the author had an affair with a married man and is now considering exposing him, the answer is likely A (Yes) because the author is complicit in the cheating. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, which would include their participation in the affair. However, the specific action of wanting to expose the cheater might be seen as a positive, but the fact that they were part of the cheating makes them complicit. \n\nSo, the correct answer is A because the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair, regardless of their intent to inform the wife later. Their initial actions were wrong, and that's the main issue.\n"
