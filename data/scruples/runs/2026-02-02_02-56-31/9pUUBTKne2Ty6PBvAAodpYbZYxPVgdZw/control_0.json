I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a man who was married and gay, but in the closet. The author found out about the marriage and the cheating. Now, they're considering telling the wife but worried about outing him.\n\nThe author's main dilemma is between the wife's right to know she's been cheated on and not wanting to out him. So, the key points here are: the author is considering reporting the cheating, which would involve the husband's sexuality.\n\nThe author is in a position where he's had multiple affairs with a married man. Normally, if someone is cheating, the person they cheated with might be at fault for not respecting the committed relationship. However, the husband's deception is significant here\u2014he was married, had kids, and was in the closet. The author claims they didn't know he was married; he didn't disclose that. But the author also knew he was gay and in the closet, so maybe there's an assumption of honesty on both sides?\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. The author's actions involved cheating themselves, which is unethical. But the main issue is whether they're wrong for planning to inform the wife. If the author is considering exposing the cheating, which is the right thing for the wife to know, but it would out him, then it's a moral dilemma.\n\nThe author is torn between two wrongs: not wanting to out the man (which is respecting his privacy) vs. the wife's right to know. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing by the wife, given the husband's deceit. However, the author's own actions in the affair could make them complicit. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for the act of exposing the cheater.\n\nIn such cases, the ethical stance would depend on whether the author's intention is to help the wronged party (the wife) despite the collateral consequences. The author isn't the one cheating; the husband is. The author is a third party who's now trying to correct the wrong. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing, even if it's difficult.\n\nBut there's a nuance here: the author had consensual affairs. Legally and morally, the husband is the one who violated his marriage. The author isn't the one who broke the vows. So, if the author is trying to inform the wife, they might be doing a good deed, even if it out the husband. However, the author's own actions in the affair might be considered morally wrong, but the question is specifically about the act of exposing the cheater.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for the exposure. Since the husband is the one who cheated and lied, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. Therefore, the answer might be B (No). But there's a counter: the author shouldn't meddle in another marriage, especially since they were part of the affair. But if the author is trying to prevent further harm, maybe they're justified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because they were part of the cheating and shouldn't take it upon themselves to expose him. But given the husband's deceit, it's a tricky situation.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the husband's deception and the wife's right to know, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform her, even if it out him. So the answer would be B.\n"
