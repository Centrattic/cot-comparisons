  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a complicated situation where they had a relationship with a married man who's also closeted. They're trying to decide whether to expose him to his wife without outing him.\n\nFirst, the user had consensual sexual encounters with someone who was already married and not out. The man was in a committed marriage with kids, which adds to the severity of the cheating. The user says they wouldn't have done it if they knew, but they still continued after finding out. That's a bit confusing. If they knew he was married, they probably wouldn't have started, but they kept going after finding out. That might mean they were aware of the cheating aspect but didn't stop immediately. \n\nNow, the user is considering telling the wife. They're worried about outing him because of his family's potential reaction. The dilemma is between protecting his privacy (not outing him) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. \n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, so there's no obligation to report it. However, ethically, it's a different story. The user might feel a moral duty to inform the wife, but doing so could out him, which he's not ready for. The user might be trying to weigh between two bad options. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? They were in a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. But they did have his initial consent (even if he was hiding his marriage). However, continuing after knowing he's married makes them complicit in the infidelity. The user's intention now is to expose the cheating but without outing him, which is tricky. If they can't do it without outing, they might have to choose between two harms. \n\nThe user might be in the wrong for continuing the relationship after knowing the man was married. Also, their plan to inform the wife without outing him might not be feasible, leading them to a situation where they either out him or let the wife be unaware. Either way, they might be violating his privacy. \n\nBut the user is also considering the man's well-being and family, which shows they're trying to be considerate. However, the act of cheating itself is a problem. So the answer might hinge on whether the user's actions (cheating) make them wrong regardless of their plan to expose him. \n\nIn summary, the user was part of an affair, which is cheating. They might be in the wrong for that. The question of whether they're in the wrong for exposing him depends on the method and intent. If they do it without his consent, it's violating his privacy, but if they do it to help the wife, it's a moral obligation versus privacy. But the initial cheating part makes them partly at fault.\n"
