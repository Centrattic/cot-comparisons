I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sleeping with someone (the usher) who is married and in the closet about being gay. The author is now conflicted about whether to expose the cheating husband, which would out him, or keep it secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author initially had a consensual relationship with the usher, who was in a confidential situation. The usher is married, and the author found out he's cheating. The author is considering telling the wife about the affair, which would out him as gay, potentially causing family issues. The author is worried about outing him but also feels the wife has a right to know.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the ethical aspects. The author's actions: having a relationship with someone who is married is cheating. But the author didn't know he was married at the time. However, after finding out, the author continued the relationship? Wait, no\u2014the user says they hooked up five more times after the wedding. Wait, the user says they found out a week ago that he's married. Wait, wait, let me check again. The user says they hooked up five more times after the wedding, then a week ago found out he's married. Wait, that would mean the author continued the relationship even after knowing he was married? Wait, no\u2014the timeline is that the author found out a week ago that he's married. Wait, the user says: \"I found out a week ago that this man is married to a woman...\" So before that, the author didn't know. So the initial encounter was at the wedding, and then more hookups after, but the author didn't know he was married until a week ago. Then, upon finding out, the author confronted him. \n\nSo the author didn't know about the marriage when they had the relationships, but after finding out, they confronted him. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him. \n\nThe author is now considering telling the wife about the affair, which would out him. Is the author in the wrong for wanting to do that? \n\nEthically, the author is in a tough spot. The husband is cheating, which is wrong. The wife has a right to know. However, outing someone's sexual orientation without their consent is a violation of their privacy, especially if they're in the closet. But since the husband is cheating, the author might argue that the wife needs to know about the infidelity, which is a separate issue from his sexual orientation. However, revealing the infidelity might inherently involve revealing that he's having affairs with men, which would out him. \n\nSo the dilemma is whether the author is obligated to inform the wife about the cheating, which would out him, or protect his privacy. The author is not the one who cheated; the husband did. The author is a third party who was involved unknowingly. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility: if the author is not the one who cheated, but is now aware of the cheating, are they morally obligated to report it? It's a gray area. Some might say the author isn't responsible for the husband's actions, so they aren't in the wrong for choosing not to expose him. Others might argue that since the wife is being wronged, the author has a duty to inform her. However, the act of informing the wife would involve outing him, which complicates things. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater (which would out him). The author is not the cheater; the husband is. The author is in a position where they have to decide between two harmful actions: outing the husband or allowing the wife to be cheated on. \n\nIs the author in the wrong if they choose either path? If the author decides not to tell the wife, they might be protecting the husband's privacy but allowing the wife to be cheated on. If they do tell, they're exposing the husband's infidelity (which is part of his being gay) and potentially out him. \n\nBut the author isn't the one who cheated. The husband is. The author is a victim of being used, as they didn't know he was married. The author's actions up to finding out might be seen as consensual, but after finding out, continuing the relationship could be problematic. Wait, the user says that after finding out, they confronted him and he broke down. It's unclear if they continued the relationship after that. The user says \"I confronted him about it and he broke down crying...\" So perhaps the author stopped the relationship at that point. \n\nIn terms of the initial question: Is the author in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater (which would out him)? The answer would hinge on whether the author has a duty to inform the wife. If the author is not the one cheating, they might not be in the wrong for choosing not to expose him, especially since it involves outing him. However, if they do choose to tell the wife, they might be justified in wanting to protect her from the infidelity, even if it comes at the cost of outing him. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions up to the point of considering telling the wife are not malicious. The author didn't know the husband was married, so the relationship wasn't with full knowledge. After finding out, the author is conflicted. The author isn't the cheater, so they aren't in the wrong for being in a relationship with him before knowing. The dilemma is about the next step. \n\nThe answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong for considering either option. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The options are whether they are in the wrong (A) or not (B). Given that the author is not the one who cheated, and they are trying to do the right thing by considering informing the wife, but are conflicted about the consequences, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author is not in the wrong for being in the situation or for considering the options. They are caught in a difficult ethical dilemma, and their intentions are to protect the wife's rights while respecting the husband's privacy.\n"
