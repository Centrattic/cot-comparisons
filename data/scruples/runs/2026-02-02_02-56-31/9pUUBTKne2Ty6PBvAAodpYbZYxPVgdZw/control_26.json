I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person had a relationship with a married man who is in the closet. They slept together multiple times, and the man confessed he's gay but not ready to come out. Now the person is conflicted between telling the wife so she knows about the cheating and not outing him because of the potential family issues.\n\nThe main question is whether the author (the person writing the WIBTA) is in the wrong for planning to tell the wife, which would out him. \n\nSo, the author is in a moral dilemma. On one hand, they want to protect the man's privacy and avoid family conflict. On the other, the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. \n\nBut the author is the one who had an affair with a married man. The man is cheating, which is wrong, but he's also in a closeted situation. The author's actions contributed to the infidelity. However, the question is about the author's current decision to expose the cheater (the man) by informing the wife, which would out him.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they are reporting the infidelity, which is a valid concern because the wife has a right to know. But by doing so, they are also outing the man, which he asked not to happen. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for choosing to out him in order to inform the wife? Well, the man is already cheating, which is wrong. The author is now trying to do the right thing by the wife, but in the process, they are violating the man's privacy. However, the man isn't being \"outed\" if he's married to a woman; the fact that he's having affairs with men is the key here. Wait, the man is married to a woman, so if the author tells her about the affairs, that's not exactly outing him as gay unless they reveal his sexuality. But if the author tells the wife that he's cheating, maybe the wife could figure out he's gay, but maybe not. The author is concerned that telling the wife would out him. Let me check the original scenario again.\n\nThe man is married to a woman. The author is having an affair with him, and he's in the closet. If the author tells the wife about the affair, the wife might not necessarily know he's gay unless the author explicitly says so. But the author is worried that by telling the wife about the affair (which he had with a man), the wife might deduce he's gay, thereby outing him. However, the author is not directly outting him; they're just reporting the infidelity. The wife is the one who could discover his sexuality through the affair. But the author is worried about causing familial issues because the man's parents are not accepting. \n\nSo, the author is in a position where they want to do the right thing for the wife but are hesitant to out the man. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for going ahead with informing the wife, even if it might lead to the man being outed.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author isn't obligated to protect the cheater's secrets, especially since the cheater was deceptive. The cheater is the one who was dishonest, not the author. However, the author did have an affair with a married man, which is ethically questionable. But the main issue here is the decision to inform the wife.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they are helping the wife know about the infidelity, which is a valid action. However, if the act of informing the wife also outed the man, the author might be responsible for that as well. But the author might not have that intent. The dilemma is whether the author should prioritize the wife's rights or the man's privacy.\n\nIn this case, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife about the infidelity, even if it has the collateral consequence of outing the man. The man is the one who is the cheater here, and the author is trying to correct the wrong done to the wife. However, the author's own actions (the affair) were also wrong, but that's separate from the current decision.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, and the man's closeted status doesn't absolve him of his infidelity. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to inform the wife, even if it leads to the man being outed.\n"
