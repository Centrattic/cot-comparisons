I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (a 20-year-old man) had an affair with a man who is married and has kids. They met at a wedding, slept together, and continued seeing each other. The husband is in the closet, not out to his family, and the author is now conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the affair, which would out him.\n\nFirst, the author is in a moral dilemma. On one hand, he doesn't want to out the man, knowing his parents might not accept his sexuality. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, even if it out him.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author had a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. But the author didn't know the man was married when they started. The man lied about his relationship status, so he's the one who's wronged both the wife and the author. Now the author is trying to decide whether to inform the wife, which would reveal the man's infidelity and his sexuality.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to tell the wife? Well, the author was also part of the affair. He's not the one who cheated; he was cheated on by the married man. However, by engaging in the affair, he contributed to the cheating. But he didn't know the man was married when it started. The man used Grindr, which implies he might have multiple partners, so he's the primary wrongdoer.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, he's helping her discover the infidelity. But outing someone's sexuality without consent is a violation of privacy. However, in this case, the act of cheating is a separate issue. The author's dilemma is between protecting the husband's privacy and the wife's right to know. \n\nThe key here is that the husband is the one who broke his marriage vows. The author is in a tricky spot because he's not the one who committed the infidelity. He's trying to decide whether to expose the husband's actions, which would also out his sexuality. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this action. \n\nIf the author is trying to do the right thing by alerting the wife, even though it might out the husband, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, he should consider other ways to inform the wife without outing the husband. For example, maybe he could just tell the wife about the affair without specifying that it's with another man, but that might not be possible if he's on Grindr. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to inform the wife through other means, but the author might not have that option. \n\nOn the flip side, by engaging in the affair, the author might be seen as complicit. However, since he didn't know the man was married, he can't be blamed for that. He was deceived. So he's now trying to make amends. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to tell the wife about the cheating, even if it out the husband. The husband is the one who's at fault here. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, given the circumstances. However, the author should consider the consequences of outing the husband, especially if it causes harm to his family. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the answer would be no, he's not in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him. He's in a difficult position, but his intentions are to do the right thing by the wife, even though it's a tough call.\n"
