I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario carefully.\n\nSo, the author is in a situation where they had a series of affairs with a married man who's also gay and closeted. They found out he's married with two kids, and now they're conflicted about whether to tell his wife, which would out him. The key points here are: the author had consensual relationships with someone who was married, and now they're considering exposing the cheating, which would reveal his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is in a consensual relationship with someone who is married. That's cheating from the man's side, but the author's role here is also questionable. They knew he was in a committed relationship but continued to see him. However, the man was the one in the marriage, so the author might not be at fault for the cheating per se. But they might be complicit in enabling the infidelity.\n\nNow, the bigger issue is whether the author is justified in exposing the cheating, which would out him. The author is conflicted between the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. The man is in a bad position, being closeted and cheating, but the wife is being cheated on.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The initial actions: sleeping with a married man. If the author didn't know he was married, maybe they're not at fault. But they did find out he was married later and continued the relationship. That could be seen as complicit. However, the main question is about whether they're in the wrong now, regarding exposing the infidelity.\n\nMoral dilemmas like this are complex. If the author decides to tell the wife, they might be right in giving the wife information she's entitled to, even if it out her husband. But if the author is considering this without the man's consent, are they violating his privacy? Alternatively, if they don't act, they might be complicit in the ongoing infidelity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, the author's actions in continuing the relationship after knowing the man was married could be seen as unethical. However, the main issue here is the decision to expose the cheating. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife but at the cost of outing someone. Depending on cultural and personal ethics, this could go either way. However, in many perspectives, the cheater (the husband) is at fault, and the author is trying to right a wrong done to the wife. So the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it out the husband. But the author is also in a morally ambiguous position for being part of the affair. However, the act of exposing the infidelity, while it out the husband, could be seen as a necessary step to protect the wife. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there are nuances. Alternatively, the author could be seen as in the wrong for being part of the affair in the first place. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong, not the man. The main question is about the exposure. The author's dilemma is about whether they should act. If they do, they might be right in informing the wife, but if they don't, they might be complicit. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if it means outing the husband, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
