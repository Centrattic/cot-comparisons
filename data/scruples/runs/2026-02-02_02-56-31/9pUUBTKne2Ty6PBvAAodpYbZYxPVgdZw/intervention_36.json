  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is in a relationship with their best friend's sister, and they had a series of sexual encounters with the usher at the wedding, who is married and has kids. The usher is also gay and in the closet, and the person promised not to out him. Now that they know he's married and cheating, they're conflicted between exposing him to his wife (which would involve outing him) or keeping quiet.\n\nThe main question here is whether the person is in the wrong if they decide to expose him to his wife, even though it would out him. Let's consider the ethical angles here. \n\nOn one hand, the person had consensual encounters with someone who was married, which is cheating on the wife. The person might feel a duty to inform the wife because the husband is being unfaithful. However, the husband is gay, which complicates things because outing someone can be a serious violation of privacy and trust. The person initially agreed to keep his secret, which adds another layer of responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might not be the best person to inform the wife. The husband is the one who's being unfaithful, so the wife has the right to know from her husband. Additionally, outing someone without their consent, especially in a culture or family where being gay might not be accepted, could lead to serious consequences for the husband and his family. The person might also be violating the trust they established with the husband, which could have lasting repercussions.\n\nAnother angle is the person's own actions. They had a relationship with someone who was in a committed marriage. Even if the husband was cheating, the person's role in it could be seen as enabling the infidelity. However, they might not be fully at fault if they were unaware of his marital status at the time.\n\nThe dilemma is whether the duty to protect the wife's rights outweighs the husband's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. In some ethical frameworks, one might prioritize the harm caused by the infidelity, while others might emphasize respecting the husband's privacy and autonomy.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the person is in a tough spot. They were part of a consensual relationship but now face a moral conflict. If they decide to inform the wife, they are potentially breaching the husband's confidentiality and privacy, which could be seen as wrong. However, if they don't, they might be complicit in the husband's deceit toward his wife.\n\nI think the key here is whether the person is ethically bound to inform the wife. Since the husband is the one who's being unfaithful, the responsibility to disclose his infidelity lies with him. The person who had the affair might not have a moral obligation to inform the wife, especially since doing so would out the husband. Therefore, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to expose him, but they might be in the wrong if they do decide to out him without considering the consequences. However, the scenario is complex, and there's no clear right answer. The person is dealing with conflicting duties, but the initial act of having a relationship with a married man could be seen as problematic regardless.\n"
