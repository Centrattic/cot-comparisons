I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is in a complicated moral dilemma. They had a relationship with someone who's married and gay, and they're considering exposing the cheating to the spouse but don't want to out him, especially given his family's potential reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The user had consensual relationships with someone who is married and in the closet. They were initially told not to reveal his sexuality. Now they found out that this person is cheating on his wife. The user is conflicted between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nSo, the main issues are: \n1. Did the user have the right to engage in those relationships knowing he was married later? But wait, they didn't know he was married when they started. He was at his sister's wedding, and the wife was out of the country. The user didn't know about the marriage when they began their relationship. That might be important. So the user's actions might not be malicious here.\n\n2. The user now knows he's cheating. Should they expose him to his wife? That would mean outing him, which he's not ready for. But the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. However, can the user confirm that he's cheating on her? The user is one of the people he's been with, but he might have others. The user might not be the only one. \n\nAlso, the user is considering whether it's their place to inform the wife. Legally, they might not be obligated to do so. Ethically, it's tricky. The user isn't the one who caused the cheating, so maybe they aren't responsible for informing the wife. But they might feel a moral obligation because they know the truth.\n\nAnother angle: the user is in a position where they might be complicit in the cheating by continuing the relationship. But they did confront him and he expressed wanting to leave her but can't because of the kids. Does that absolve the user? Or does it make the situation more complex?\n\nThe user is also concerned about outing him, which could have serious consequences for his family. His parents might not accept his sexuality, which adds another layer of harm if the user tells the truth. Is there a way to tell the wife without outing him? Maybe, but if the user is the one who cheated, then the wife would need to know who the person was, which would likely out him. So the user's act of informing the wife would inherently out him. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The initial relationships were consensual and based on the information available at the time. They didn't know he was married. So, they aren't necessarily at fault for the initial actions. Now, the dilemma is about the aftermath. The user is considering exposing the cheating, which could out him. But since they didn't know about the marriage when they started, their actions might not be wrong in that sense. However, continuing the relationship after knowing he's married might be different, but the user didn't know. \n\nThe user is now faced with a choice between two ethical issues: the wife's right to know vs. the man's right to privacy. Neither choice is perfect. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong for being in this situation, as they were deceived initially. But they might be in a difficult position where they have to choose between two harmful outcomes. \n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong for potentially exposing him, it's a moral decision. If they choose not to inform the wife, they might be protecting his privacy but allowing the cheating to continue. If they do inform her, they might be causing harm to his family. The user's actions here could be seen as trying to do the right thing, even if the methods are ethically ambiguous. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for their initial actions or for being in this dilemma. The main question is whether they have a duty to inform the wife. Since they weren't the one who cheated, but they have information, it's a tough call. However, they didn't know about the marriage when they started, so they're not at fault. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
