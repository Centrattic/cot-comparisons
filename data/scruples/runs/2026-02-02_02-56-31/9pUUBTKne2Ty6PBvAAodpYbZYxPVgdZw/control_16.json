I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 20-year-old man, had an affair with a married man who's in the closet. The guy is cheating on his wife, and the author found out about this. Now the author is torn between exposing the cheater (which would out him as gay) and keeping it secret.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married. That's cheating, so the author is complicit in the other man's infidelity. The guy was married with kids, and the author knew he was married? Wait, no\u2014he didn't know initially. The author found out a week ago that he was married. So the author had multiple encounters not knowing he was married. So the author didn't know, but when he found out, he still had to deal with the situation. \n\nThe author is now considering telling the wife about the cheating, but that would out him as gay. The author is worried about outing him because his parents are not open-minded. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know she was cheated on. But the author might be in the wrong for getting involved in the first place. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he was in a relationship with a married person. That's generally considered wrong because it's adultery. Even if the married man was the one who initiated it, the author's participation makes him complicit. The author didn't know about the marriage at first, but once he did, continuing the relationship was still part of the cheating. \n\nNow, the author is trying to decide whether to expose the cheater. But since the author was part of the cheating, he might not have a strong moral ground to take. Also, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a big deal. However, the author is in a dilemma because the wife deserves to know. But the author's own actions might have contributed to the problem. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is probably yes because he engaged in an affair with a married person. Even if he didn't know initially, continuing after knowing makes it his fault. So, Answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
