I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having an affair with a married man, who is also gay and closeted, and now considering exposing him to his wife.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship themselves, so cheating is a red flag. They had multiple affairs knowing the guy is married, which is definitely cheating. The guy is in a closeted situation, so the author's actions complicate his personal life. The author is now considering telling the wife, which would out him. \n\nThe key points here are consent and betrayal. The author didn't have the wife's consent to be in a relationship with her husband. Even if the husband is also cheating, the author's role in it isn't justified. By continuing the affair, they're participating in the betrayal. \n\nNow, when considering if the author is in the wrong, there are two angles: their actions in the affair and their potential to expose the cheater. The affair itself is a breach of trust if the author is in a committed relationship. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong in the scenario. \n\nThe author is conflicted about outing the man, which is a separate issue. However, their main wrongdoing is participating in the affair without the wife's knowledge. They also have a moral dilemma about exposing him, but the fact that they're considering it shows they recognize the ethical implications. However, the act of continuing the affair and planning to involve the wife could be seen as complicity. \n\nIn terms of the initial question, the author's actions (cheating) are likely wrong, so the answer would be A. But maybe some might argue that the husband is the one at fault. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since they engaged in an affair knowingly, that's a breach of ethics, especially if they are in a relationship themselves. The act of exposing him could be a separate issue, but the main wrong is the affair. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, so answer A.\n"
