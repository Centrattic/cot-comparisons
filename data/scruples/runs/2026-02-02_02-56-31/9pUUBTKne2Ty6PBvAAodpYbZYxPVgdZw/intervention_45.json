  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person here is caught in a moral dilemma. They had a relationship with someone who's married and in the closet. They didn't know he was married when they started sleeping together. Now they found out he's cheating on his wife, and they're considering exposing him to the wife, which would also out him as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their actions. Did they do something wrong by sleeping with him? He was married, so that's cheating. But the person here didn't know initially. They continued the relationship after finding out, but maybe they feel guilty because they know what cheating does to people. So maybe they feel responsible for telling his wife because they were part of the cheating. Then again, maybe not, since they weren't the one who married him. \n\nThen there's the aspect of outing him. He asked them not to tell anyone, so if they tell the wife, they're breaking his trust. But the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a big deal. The person is trying to balance between protecting the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the person could contact the wife anonymously? But that's tricky. If the wife finds out through someone else later, it could complicate things. Also, the person might be worried about the man's family reaction if he comes out. But the wife deserves to know. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? If they don't tell the wife, are they complicit? If they do tell, they might be the one who caused the exposure. It's a tough call. The person might feel they're in the wrong for getting involved, but they also acted out of a desire to do the right thing. \n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Considering the complexity, maybe the person isn't in the wrong because they're trying to correct their mistake by considering telling the wife. But they might be in the wrong for sleeping with a married man. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong for exposing the cheater. If they do expose him, it's a moral conflict, but not necessarily their fault. The answer might be B because they're trying to do the right thing, even if it's hard.\n"
