  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheating spouse, which would also out him as gay. They had a relationship with the husband, who was married and has kids. He asked not to be outed, and the user is conflicted between the wife's right to know and not wanting to cause family issues.\n\nFirst, the ethical angles. The user had consensual relationships with someone who was married, so there's an element of infidelity here. But the husband is also in a closeted situation, which complicates things. The user is now thinking about informing the wife, which would end his marriage secrets but also his marriage, possibly affecting the kids. \n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but the ethical dilemma is about the user's responsibility. If the husband is cheating, the wife has a right to know, but the user wasn't in a committed relationship with him. However, the user is also considering outing him, which he's not ready for. There's a balance between respecting his privacy and the wife's rights.\n\nMoral responsibility: the user might feel they have a duty to tell the wife because it's a betrayal of trust. But they could also be seen as an accomplice by not speaking up. However, the user wasn't in a position to know about the marriage initially. The user's actions (the affair) contributed to the situation, which might place some blame on them for not considering the husband's marital status. \n\nAlternatives: Could the user inform the wife anonymously? That might avoid outing him, but it's unclear if that's feasible. Also, the wife has a right to know, but the user's role here is tricky. \n\nConsidering all this, the user's actions led to a situation where they now have conflicting obligations. They might be in the wrong for engaging in a relationship with a married person, and then for considering informing the wife without the husband's consent. So the answer might be A, but there's nuance here.\n"
