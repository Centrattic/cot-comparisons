  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. They had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They care about him but feel guilty because he cheated on his wife. They want to tell the wife but don't want to out him, especially since his family might not accept it.\n\nFirst, the main ethical conflict here is between the right of the wife to know she's been cheated on and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The person is trying to decide if they should breach confidentiality to inform the wife. \n\nOn one hand, the man asked for secrecy about his sexuality, and outing him could cause family issues. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. But the person wasn't a party to the marriage, so they might feel obligated to act. However, they also took part in the affair, which complicates things. \n\nIt's important to consider the consequences. Telling the wife would out the man, which could harm his family relationships. But not telling the wife means she remains unaware of the cheating. The person might feel conflicted because they care about both parties. \n\nLegally, the man's infidelity is a private matter between him and his wife. The person isn't legally bound to inform the wife unless there's a duty of care, which isn't the case here. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some might argue the wife has a right to know, while others might prioritize the man's right to privacy. \n\nThe person's actions in the past (sleeping with a married man) might make them complicit in the deception. But they also feel remorse and want to do the right thing. However, their role here isn't clear-cut. They\u2019re not in a position to mediate the marriage or decide others' lives. \n\nPossible alternatives: Maybe the person could encourage the man to come out to his wife on his own terms, or seek mediation. But if they take direct action, they risk causing more harm than good. \n\nUltimately, the question is whether the person is in the wrong. If they proceed to out the man without his consent, they're violating his privacy. However, if they stay silent, they're allowing the wife to be deceived. But since the person was involved in the affair, their judgment might be biased. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards \"A\" (they are in the wrong) because they're using their position to expose someone else's private matter, potentially causing harm without their consent. But if they're trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, it's a tough call. However, the act of outing someone without consent is generally considered wrong, even with good intentions.\n"
