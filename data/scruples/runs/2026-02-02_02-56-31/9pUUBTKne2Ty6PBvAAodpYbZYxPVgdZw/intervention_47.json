  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to figure out if they're in the wrong by considering exposing the married man who cheated. He's in a tough spot because the man is in a closeted relationship and the user slept with him multiple times without knowing he was married. Now, they want to tell the wife but are conflicted about outing him.\n\nFirst, the user had consensual relationships with the man, who was upfront about being gay but not ready to come out. The user respected that initially. But when they found out he was married, they felt guilty and wanted to inform the wife. The dilemma is between honesty and privacy.\n\nLegally, cheating is a personal matter, but the user's actions might be seen as a breach of confidentiality since the man trusted them not to reveal his sexuality. However, the user didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair. They're now facing a moral conflict between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy.\n\nIf the user tells the wife, they might be outing him, which could have serious consequences for his family. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, the user might not have a legal or ethical obligation to inform the wife unless there's a duty of care or specific laws requiring it, which varies by location. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, some might argue the user isn't at fault because they were deceived by the man. Others might say that sleeping with someone who is married is inherently wrong. But the user's intention to inform the wife is out of a sense of duty, which complicates things. \n\nThe key points are: the user didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair, they respected the man's privacy until finding out, and now they're trying to balance the wife's rights with the man's privacy. The answer would depend on whether the user's actions in exposing the cheating were justified despite the potential fallout. Since the user didn't know the man was married and the man was deceptive, the user's decision to inform the wife might be seen as a protective act rather than a wrong one. So, the answer leans towards B (No, I am not in the wrong).\n"
