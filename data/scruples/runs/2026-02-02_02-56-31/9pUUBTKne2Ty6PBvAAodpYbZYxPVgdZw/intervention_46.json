I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing someone who cheated, even if it out them as gay. \n\nFirst, the situation: they had a sexual relationship with a married man who's in the closet. He's cheating on his wife, and the user is now conflicted between protecting his privacy and informing the wife about the infidelity. The user wants to know if they're in the wrong if they inform the wife, which would out him.\n\nThe key points here are the ethical dilemmas between honesty and privacy. The user didn't know he was married when they started the affair, so they weren't intentionally cheating. They also took the man's confidentiality seriously initially. Now, they're caught between the wife's right to know about the cheating and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nIf the user exposes the man, they're essentially breaking his trust and outing him, which is a serious breach of confidentiality. However, the wife has a right to know if she's being cheated on. But the user didn't have a direct relationship with the wife, so they might not be the best person to inform her. \n\nAlso, the user was in a situation where they were deceived. The man withheld important information (his marital status and sexuality) from them. The user's actions might have been influenced by this deception. \n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. However, the method matters. Outing someone can have severe consequences, and the user might not be the appropriate person to do so. They could consider more private ways to inform the wife without outing him, like using a third party or a letter. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong for exposing him. If the exposure is necessary to inform the wife, maybe it's justified, but if it's done recklessly, it's not. The user's intention is to prevent further harm to the wife, which is understandable. However, the act of outing someone is complex and can have negative repercussions.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method and whether they have the right to do so are debatable. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that they need to handle it carefully to avoid unnecessary harm.\n"
