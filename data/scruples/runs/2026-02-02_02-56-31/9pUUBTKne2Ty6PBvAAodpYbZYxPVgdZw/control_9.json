I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with a married man who's in the closet. They knew he was gay but not out, and they had multiple encounters. Now they found out he's married with kids, so he's cheating on his wife. The author is conflicted between wanting to tell the wife about the cheating but not wanting to out him to his family, especially since his parents might not accept his sexuality.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing him. Let's break it down. The man is cheating, which is a betrayal to his wife. The author is considering informing the wife, which would be the right thing in terms of the marriage. However, doing so would out him as gay, which he's not ready for. \n\nIs the author obligated to tell the wife? In some cases, people might feel a duty to inform a spouse of infidelity, but this is a personal decision. However, the act of outing someone without their consent can be a violation of their privacy, especially if they're not ready to come out. The author might be complicit in the cheating, having had multiple affairs, which complicates their position. They might have a responsibility to the wife, but also a responsibility to not out someone against their will.\n\nThe author's actions also involve their friend's family. By getting involved, they might be overstepping. They were friends with the family, so they might feel a connection, but it's not their place to intervene in the husband's marriage. The author's own behavior in having an affair is questionable, which could affect their moral standing in this situation.\n\nLegally, exposing someone's infidelity isn't a crime, but outing someone's sexuality without consent can have serious consequences, especially in a family context. Ethically, it's a balancing act between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. \n\nThere might be a way to inform the wife without outing him, perhaps through anonymous means, but the author is considering direct action. However, if the wife finds out through another method, the author's role in the cheating could become an issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. Their initial actions of having an affair contribute to the problem. While the wife deserves to know about the infidelity, the method of disclosure that outing the man might be harmful. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, but their decision to out him without his consent could be problematic. Therefore, the answer could be A (yes), but some might argue B (no) based on the duty to inform the wife. However, considering the potential harm of outing someone, the answer leans towards A.\n"
