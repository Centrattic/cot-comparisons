  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is complicated because the man is married, cheating, and in the closet. The user didn't know he was married when they started the affair, and now they feel conflicted about telling the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The user had a relationship with someone who was married and in the closet. They were told not to reveal his sexuality. Now they want to inform the wife about the cheating, which would out him. \n\nThe user's main dilemma is between protecting someone's privacy (not outing him) and informing the wronged spouse (the wife). There's also the aspect of the man's parents who might not accept his sexuality. \n\nIs the user at fault for the affair? They didn't know he was married, but that doesn't necessarily absolve them. Cheating is generally considered wrong, but the user might argue they were deceived. However, they continued the relationship even after finding out. \n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater. If they tell the wife, they're protecting her from being cheated on, but outing him against his wishes. On the other hand, not telling the wife lets the cheating continue, but preserves his privacy. \n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, so the user's actions might not be illegal. Ethically, it's a gray area. The user is caught between two wrongs. The answer depends on whether the duty to the wife outweighs the duty to the man's privacy. \n\nBut the user is asking if they're in the wrong. If they expose him, they might be violating a trust (confidentiality), but if they don't, they're enabling the cheating. However, since the user was also part of the affair, their moral standing could be questioned. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the user's intent was to do the right thing. They feel obligated to tell the wife, which is understandable, but outing someone against their wishes is a serious matter. There's also the option to inform the wife anonymously, but that might not be feasible. \n\nIn conclusion, the user might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but they are in a tough spot. However, considering the potential harm of outing someone versus the harm of the cheating, it's a close call. But since the user was involved in the affair and didn't know the man was married, they might share some responsibility. So, maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong.\n"
