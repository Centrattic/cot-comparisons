I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where they had a relationship with a married man who is in the closet. They found out he's married with kids and cheated on his wife. The author now wants to tell the wife about the cheating but does so by outing him, which would reveal his sexuality and cause family issues.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author had a consensual relationship initially, but it became non-consensual when they found out he was married. However, the author had already formed a close bond and continued the relationship. Now, the dilemma is between protecting his privacy (not outing him) versus exposing the cheating (which would require outing him).\n\nMoral considerations: Cheating is a betrayal, and the wife has a right to know. However, outing someone against their will can be harmful, especially in a close-knit family where the parents might react poorly. The author is in a tricky spot. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author is using the wife's right to know as a justification for outing the man. However, the act of outing him in the process might not be necessary. The author could potentially inform the wife without revealing his sexuality, but that might not be possible if the cheating was with another man. If the author does reveal his sexuality, they're violating his privacy, which he had previously asked to keep secret. \n\nThe author also had a secret relationship with the cheater, so they might not be in a position to take a moral high ground. They were part of the infidelity. Additionally, the author's actions (sleeping with a married man) could be seen as contributing to the problem. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot, but they have a duty to inform the wife of the cheating. However, the method of doing so (outing him) might be where they go wrong. The question is whether they have the right to expose his sexuality, which is a separate issue from the cheating. \n\nTherefore, the author's intention to protect the cheater's privacy by not outing him might conflict with their intention to inform the wife. But if the only way to inform the wife is by outing him, the author needs to weigh the consequences. However, the act of outing someone without their consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the situation. So the author is in the wrong for outing him, even if the motivation is to prevent further cheating. \n\nAlternatively, if the author can find another way to inform the wife without outing the man, that would be better. But since the author is considering outing him, they might be crossing a line. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are violating the cheater's privacy by outing him, even if their intent is to expose the cheating. The two issues are connected, but the act of outing someone without consent is a separate ethical issue.\n"
