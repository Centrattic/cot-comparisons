  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. They had a relationship with someone who's married and closeted. The man is cheating on his wife, and the person feels conflicted between telling the wife and keeping his secret.\n\nFirst, the person isn't the one who made the choices here. The married man made the decisions to cheat and stay closeted. The person is now in a dilemma about whether to expose him. Since they were in a consensual relationship, they didn't force anything. The cheater's actions are the problem here, not the person who's now thinking about telling the wife.\n\nBut there's the aspect of outing someone. The person is concerned about the man's family and his well-being. They do care about him but also feel the wife deserves to know about the betrayal. However, outing someone without intent to cause harm but to protect another person's rights is a tough call. \n\nLegally, the person isn't obligated to tell the wife. They didn't enter into an agreement with the man to report his affairs. The man's choice to be in a closed relationship and cheat is his responsibility. The person is a third party here, so they might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. But ethically, there's a balance between the wife's right to know and the man's privacy regarding his sexual orientation.\n\nIf they tell the wife, they might be violating the man's confidentiality, even if he was unfaithful. But he's the one who violated the marriage. The person might not be at fault for trying to correct that wrong. However, there's a risk of causing more harm by outing him, especially with family dynamics involved.\n\nAlternatively, they could involve authorities or a professional, but that's not straightforward. Maybe the person isn't in the wrong because they were deceived by the married man and are trying to do the right thing by the wife. The key is that the cheater is the one who's in the wrong, not the person who's now considering exposing the truth. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (No, they're not in the wrong). But there's a lot of nuance here. They need to weigh the consequences carefully, but the act of exposing the cheater isn't their fault because they were part of a consensual relationship and are now trying to address the harm the cheater caused.\n"
