  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing someone who cheated if it means outing them. They had a relationship with a married man who's also in the closet. They didn't know he was married at first, and now they feel conflicted between wanting to tell his wife and not wanting to out him.\n\nFirst, the user didn't know he was married when they started the affair. That's a key point. If they had known, they wouldn't have continued. So maybe they're not entirely at fault for the initial part. But the affair itself is a problem because he's married. The user is now trying to decide whether to inform the wife, which would out him as gay. The user is close to his family and cares about his well-being, so they don't want to cause family issues.\n\nThe dilemma here is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and respecting his privacy regarding his sexuality. Legally and ethically, the user isn't obligated to inform the wife unless there's a legal requirement, which varies by place. However, the user's moral stance is that they want to do the right thing, which might mean informing the wife, but they're torn because of the potential consequences of outing him.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? If they act to protect the wife, they might be righting a wrong. If they don't, they might be enabling the cheater. But the situation is complex. The user didn't know about the marriage initially, which complicates their responsibility. However, after finding out, continuing the relationship might be seen as complicity. But the user is trying to make amends by considering disclosure. \n\nIn terms of their own actions, the user is in a tough spot. They might not be in the wrong because they didn't know the man was married and are now trying to address it. However, their actions (the affair) are problematic regardless. But the question is about being in the wrong now, when considering exposing him. If they choose to inform the wife, they might be doing a necessary thing to protect her. If they don't, they're possibly enabling the cheater. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the user's intention to inform is justified. Since they had no prior knowledge of the marriage and are now trying to correct their mistake, they're likely not in the wrong. However, the act of sleeping with a married man is ethically questionable, but the question is about the current dilemma. So, given the options, the answer is probably B (No, they're not in the wrong) because they're trying to rectify a situation they were unaware of initially and are considering the wife's rights.\n"
