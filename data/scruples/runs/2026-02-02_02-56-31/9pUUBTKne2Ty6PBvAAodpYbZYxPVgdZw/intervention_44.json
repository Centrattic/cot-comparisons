I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater who is married and in the closet. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person had a relationship with someone who was married and in the closet. They didn't know about the marriage initially and later found out. The guy is cheating on his wife, which is wrong. Now the dilemma is whether to tell the wife, which would out him.\n\nSo, the user's actions: They had a relationship without knowing the person was married. Then, upon finding out, they feel conflicted between protecting the guy's privacy (since he's closeted) and informing the wife about the cheating.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they didn't know the person was married when they started the relationship. But they did know he was in a committed relationship (marriage) once they found out. However, the main issue is whether they should expose the cheating, which would out him as gay. \n\nEthically, it's tricky. Cheating is a betrayal, and the wife has a right to know. But outing someone without their consent is also a violation of their privacy. The user might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the guy's secret, but they also have a moral obligation to the wife. However, the user isn't directly responsible for the cheating; they're caught in the middle. \n\nBut wait, the user was involved in the affair. So, they are complicit in the cheating. That complicates things. They did know it was wrong eventually. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater. If they do expose him, they might be protecting the wife but violating his privacy. If they don't, they're letting the wife be deceived. \n\nThe user's main question is about their own wrongdoing. Since they were part of the cheating, they have some responsibility. But the core of the question is about exposing the cheater. The answer hinges on whether their intent is to do the right thing by the wife while respecting the guy's privacy. \n\nIn terms of answer A or B: If they are in the wrong (A), it's because they were part of the cheating. If not (B), it's because they're trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it's difficult. But considering the user's role in the affair, maybe they are partially at fault. However, the main question is about exposing the cheater, not their own actions. The user's own actions (cheating) are part of the scenario but the main issue is the decision to expose. \n\nBut the user is asking if they are in the wrong in this situation. The answer might be B (No) because they're trying to inform the wronged party (the wife) about the cheating, which is a moral duty. However, outing the person without his consent is another issue. The answer could be B because the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, even if it means outing. But some might argue that they are in the wrong for being part of the affair. \n\nBut the question specifically asks if they're in the wrong \"in the situation\" of exposing the cheater. So the focus is on the act of exposing. If they do it, they might be justified in wanting to protect the wife, hence B. But if they are part of the cheating, that's another layer. However, the user's own actions are part of the scenario but not the focus of the question. The question is about whether their intention to expose is wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B. They're not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it out him. But there's a nuance. However, the user is also part of the cheating, which complicates their position. But the main question is about the act of exposing. So, B (No) they are not in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater to protect the wife, even if it means outing him.\n"
