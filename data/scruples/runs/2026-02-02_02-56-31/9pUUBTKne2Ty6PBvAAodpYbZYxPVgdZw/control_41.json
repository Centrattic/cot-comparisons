I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would involve outing him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had a series of affairs with a married man who is in the closet. The man asked the author not to reveal his sexuality. Now the author found out the man is cheating and is considering telling his wife, which would out him.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author is part of a secret relationship with someone who's married and closeted. The author is conflicted between exposing the cheating and outing the man, versus protecting his privacy. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author tells the wife, they are exposing the man's infidelity, which is a breach of confidentiality. However, the man himself cheated, so maybe the author is justified in wanting to inform the wife. But the act of telling the wife would also out the man as gay, which he's not ready to do. \n\nThe author's actions involve breaking the man's trust by revealing his secrets. Even if the author's intention is to prevent further cheating, they are still violating the man's confidentiality. The author could be seen as violating the man's privacy by exposing both his infidelity and his sexuality without his consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. But the author isn't directly connected to the wife, so stepping in here might be overstepping. Also, the author initiated the relationship while knowing the man was married, which complicates things. \n\nThe author's initial decision to have sex with a married man is problematic. That's cheating on the wife's part. The author's involvement in a secret relationship with a married person is a breach of trust towards the wife. Now, by considering exposing the man, the author is trying to mitigate their own mistake by informing the wife, but that still involves outing him. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They made a wrong choice by sleeping with a married person. Then, they're trying to fix it by exposing the man, which has its own ethical issues. The act of outing someone's sexuality without consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. The author is in a complex situation but their initial actions contributed to the problem. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong both for participating in the affair and for considering exposing the man's secrets. Even if the intention is to do the right thing by the wife, the method involves violating the man's privacy. So, the answer is A.\n"
