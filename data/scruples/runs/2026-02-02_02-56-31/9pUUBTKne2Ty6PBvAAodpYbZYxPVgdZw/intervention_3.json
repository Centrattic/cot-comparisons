  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. \n\nFirst, they had a relationship with the man who's married and in the closet. They didn't know he was married when they started sleeping together, which complicates things. Now they found out he's married and cheating, and they're conflicted about what to do.\n\nOn one hand, they don't want to out him because his family might not accept his sexuality, and he's not ready. But on the other hand, the wife has the right to know about the infidelity. The user is torn between protecting his privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nThe key points here: Did the user know he was married? No, so their initial involvement wasn't malicious. They respected his wish to stay in the closet, which shows they cared about his well-being. Now they're trying to do the right thing by informing the wife but are worried about outing him. \n\nIs there a way to inform the wife without outing him? Maybe, but it's tricky. The user might be trying to balance between two wrongs. However, if they don't act, the wife is being deceived. But if they do act, they might be exposing his identity as gay, which he's not ready for. \n\nThe user's intentions are to do the right thing, even though the options are tough. They're not the one who cheated; they were misled. So, are they in the wrong? It's a moral dilemma, but their actions were consensual and based on incomplete information. Therefore, the answer is B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
