  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The person is asking whether they're wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. They had an affair with a married man who's in the closet. The man is married with kids, and they found out he's cheating. The person is conflicted between not wanting to out him (due to family issues) and feeling the wife has a right to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. On one hand, the person had consensual relationships with someone who was married, so they might be at fault for cheating. But the man is also cheating, which is wrong. The question is whether the person has a moral obligation to tell the wife, even if it out him as gay.\n\nThe man asked for secrecy regarding his sexuality, and the person respected that. But now, the person is considering violating that confidentiality to inform the wife about the affair. That's a breach of trust, but the wife is being cheated on. However, outing someone's sexuality without consent is also a violation of their privacy.\n\nThe person argues they feel obligated to tell the wife because she has a right to know. But does the wife have a right to that information if it comes at the cost of outing someone? Maybe there's a way to report the infidelity without revealing his sexuality. For example, the wife could be told that her husband is having an affair, but the person might not have to disclose the sexual orientation aspect unless necessary. However, if the person is the one telling the wife, they might need to explain how they know, which could inadvertently out him.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Reporting through other means, like involving authorities or the wife's support network without directly outing him? The person might not be in the best position to decide this. They were part of the affair, so their judgment could be biased. Also, they might be trying to make amends by informing the wife, but it's still a breach of confidentiality.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The person might not be entirely in the wrong because the cheater is the one who committed the infidelity. However, by deciding to expose the cheater, they're taking on a role that's not typically theirs to play, and it's complicated by the potential outing. The person's intentions matter here\u2014trying to do the right thing by the wife versus respecting the man's privacy. It's possible they're in a gray area where neither choice is entirely right or wrong, but the act of outing someone could have severe consequences. So, maybe the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong because the cheater is primarily at fault, but they need to consider the consequences of their actions carefully.\n"
