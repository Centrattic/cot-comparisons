I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author sleeping with a married man who's in the closet about being gay. The author is now conflicted about whether to tell the man's wife about the affair, which would also out him.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married and not out as gay. The man asked not to be outed. The author now wants to inform the wife about the cheating but doesn't want to out him. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know and respecting the man's privacy.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, cheating is generally considered wrong, so the man is at fault here. However, the author is now considering exposing the man's infidelity, which would out him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they're helping her know she's been cheated on, which is her right. But outing the man against his wishes is a violation of his privacy. However, the man was deceptive by hiding both his infidelity and his sexuality. The author might have a moral obligation to the wife, but they also made a promise to the man not to out him.\n\nThe author's actions are complicated. They were part of an affair, which isn't ideal, but the main issue is the decision to expose the man. By doing so, they might be the one who actually outed him, which he explicitly didn't want. However, the wife has a right to know about the cheating. The author's intention is to inform the wife but not out the man, but realistically, revealing the affair would likely lead to the truth about his sexuality coming out.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author tells the wife, they might be justified in helping her discover the infidelity, but outing the man could be crossing a line. However, the man was already cheating, which is his own wrongdoing. The author's actions could be seen as a way to expose the cheating without necessarily being in the wrong, but they might be breaching confidentiality. Alternatively, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting the man's wishes to remain closeted, even if he was at fault for the affair.\n\nThis is tricky. The key points are the man's deception and the author's intention to inform the wife. The author's moral dilemma is valid, but their actions could be seen as a way to right a wrong caused by the man. However, outing someone without their consent is generally considered wrong unless there's a compelling reason. Since the wife has a right to know, the author might not be in the wrong for informing her, even if it leads to outing him. But the author might need to consider if there's a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality, which the post mentions as a possibility but uncertainty.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a complex situation where both the wife's rights and the man's privacy are at stake. However, the man's cheating is the initial wrongdoing. The author's intention to help the wife might not make them wrong, but the method of doing so by outing him could be problematic. However, given the circumstances, the author's primary obligation is to the wife, so the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
