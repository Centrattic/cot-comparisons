  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is in a complicated situation. So, they had a relationship with someone who's married and in the closet. The guy asked them not to tell anyone because he's gay and not ready to come out. Now the user found out he's cheating on his wife and wants to tell her but doesn't want to out him. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they did something wrong. They had a relationship with someone who was already married, which is cheating. But they thought they were in a consensual situation. However, the guy is hiding his sexuality and cheating. The user is conflicted between protecting his privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nIf the user exposes the cheating, they might out him, which he didn't want. But the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. The user is trying to balance these two things. Legally, in most places, cheating isn't a crime, but ethically, it's wrong. The user is in a position where they have to decide between two bad options: keeping the secret or breaking it to protect someone else.\n\nThe user's actions so far (sleeping with a married person) are morally questionable, but they didn't know he was married when they started. Now they feel guilty and want to do the right thing. But by telling the wife, they'd be outing him against his wishes. However, the wife's right to know her spouse's infidelity might outweigh his privacy in this case.\n\nBut the user isn't directly involved with the wife; they're an outsider. They might not have the right to meddle in that relationship. Also, if they tell the wife, they could be a source of false information. It's possible they could talk to the guy again to convince him to come clean to his wife. If that fails, maybe then it's justified to step in. But the user is considering doing it themselves, which is a big step.\n\nSo, the user's main question is whether they're wrong for exposing the cheater, even if it out him. The answer depends on the moral framework. If the harm to the wife is greater than the harm to the husband's privacy, then maybe it's justified. But if the user is overstepping their role, they could be wrong. Also, the user might be in the wrong for being part of the cheating in the first place, but that's a different aspect.\n\nThe user is trying to do the right thing, but the situation is complex. They might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but the method of doing so by outing someone could be problematic. However, given the husband's deceit, maybe the user isn't in the wrong for exposing the truth to the wife. It's a tough call, but I think the answer is B (No), because the user is trying to correct a wrong done to the wife, even if it causes other issues.\n"
