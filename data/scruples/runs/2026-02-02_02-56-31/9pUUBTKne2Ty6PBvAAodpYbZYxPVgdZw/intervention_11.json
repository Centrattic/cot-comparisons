  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The scenario is complex.\n\nFirst, the user had an affair with a married man who's in the closet. The man asked him not to tell anyone because he's not ready to come out. The user now found out he's married and wants to tell the wife but doesn't want to out him. The main conflict is between the wife's right to know about the cheating and the man's privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nThe user is struggling with moral responsibility. On one hand, cheating is wrong, and the wife deserves to know. On the other hand, outing someone against their wishes could have serious consequences, especially with family dynamics mentioned. The user also cares for the man and doesn't want to cause family issues.\n\nPossible angles: The user is in a position where they were lied to. The man was deceptive by not disclosing his marital status and being in the closet. However, the user also engaged in a consensual affair. So, both parties might have some responsibility here. \n\nIf the user tells the wife, they could be seen as helping the wife, but at the cost of outing the man, which could be harmful. Alternatively, not telling the wife might let the cheating continue. However, the user isn't directly involved with the wife; their relationship is through the friend's family. \n\nLegally, the user probably isn't in the wrong, but ethically it's a gray area. The user's actions were consensual, but they were part of an affair which is ethically questionable. However, the user's intention to inform the wife is about honesty, which is positive. But the method of doing so might be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing by the wife, but they might need to find a way to inform her without outing the man. However, since the question is whether the user is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because they were deceived and are trying to rectify it, even if the method is tricky. Alternatively, maybe A if their actions could cause unnecessary harm. But the user's dilemma is about moral obligation, not legal wrongdoing. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
