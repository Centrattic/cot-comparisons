I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the scenario is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. They had a series of encounters with a married man who's in the closet. He's cheating on his wife with kids under 4. The person is conflicted between protecting his privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with the man, who was dishonest about his marital status. The man is cheating, which is morally wrong. The author didn't know he was married, so maybe they weren't at fault there. But the main issue is whether exposing the cheating would also out him as gay, which he hasn't done yet.\n\nThe author is considering telling the wife about the cheating, which would require outing him. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know she's been cheated on and the man's privacy about his sexual orientation. Is the author in the wrong for doing that?\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they might be doing the right thing by preventing further harm to the wife. The man is cheating, so the wife deserves to know. However, outing someone against their wishes is a violation of privacy. But the man is the one who initiated the affair and is in a committed marriage, which is a betrayal. The author's actions here are a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe key points: the man is the one who broke the trust in his marriage. The author's intention is to inform the wife, which could be seen as a protective act. However, outing the man without his consent is another issue. But since the affair is part of the disclosure, the author is essentially revealing both the cheating and his sexuality. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. They might feel guilt for their role, but they weren't aware of his marital status. The real wrongdoer is the man. The author's decision to inform the wife is a tough choice but might be justified in protecting the wife. So, the author isn't in the wrong for considering it, but the act of outing someone without their consent is still sensitive. However, given the context of cheating, it's a complex situation where the author's intent is to prevent harm. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), they are not in the wrong.\n"
