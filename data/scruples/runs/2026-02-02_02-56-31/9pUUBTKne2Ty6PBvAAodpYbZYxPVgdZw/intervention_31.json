  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is in a complicated situation where they had a sexual relationship with a married man who's also closeted. The man is married with two kids, and the person found out he's cheating on his wife. Now they're torn between outing him (which would reveal he's gay) or telling the wife about the affair, which would out him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The person didn't know he was married when they started the relationship. They were friends with his family for years, so maybe they had a certain level of trust. The man asked them not to tell anyone about his sexuality, and they respected that. But now they're in this moral dilemma.\n\nIs the person in the wrong for being involved with a married man? Well, they didn't know he was married initially, so maybe not. But after finding out, continuing the relationship could be seen as wrong. However, the man was the one who was deceptive, hiding his marriage and his sexuality. The person might feel they were misled.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether to expose him to his wife, which would out him to his family who might not be accepting. On one hand, the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent is a big deal, especially if it could harm his family and kids.\n\nThe person is conflicted because they don't want to cause family issues but also feel the wife deserves the truth. They might be trying to balance between the wife's rights and the man's privacy and safety regarding his sexuality.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The person isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the married man did. The person was deceived. However, continuing the relationship after knowing could be seen as enabling the cheating. But they did confront him and felt guilty, which shows some moral consideration.\n\nThe answer here hinges on whether the person is at fault for the affair. Since they were deceived initially and later found out, they might not be entirely in the wrong. But the act of continuing the relationship after knowing the man is married could be problematic. However, the main wrongdoer is the married man. The person's dilemma is about whether to expose him, which is a different question than being wrong themselves.\n\nSo, the answer is more likely B (Not in the wrong), but the situation is complex. The person's main issue is deciding whether to inform the wife, which is a separate ethical question from whether they themselves are wrong for the affair.\n"
