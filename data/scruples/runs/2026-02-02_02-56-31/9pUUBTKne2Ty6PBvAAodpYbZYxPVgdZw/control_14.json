I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex. The author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. The man is cheating on his wife, and the author is now conflicted about whether to expose him to his wife, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author is in a dilemma between protecting the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. The author didn't know the man was married when they started the affair, which complicates things. The author also cares for the man and doesn't want to cause family issues. But the cheating is a serious betrayal, and the wife deserves to know.\n\nThe key points are: the author was deceived initially (the man didn't disclose being married), they had multiple encounters, and the author now wants to inform the wife. But outing the man's sexuality might be necessary to inform the wife. However, the author is considering whether there's a way to do that without outing him, which might be tricky.\n\nLegally, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. Ethically, it's a matter of balancing her rights against his privacy. The author isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the man did. The author might be trying to make amends by informing the wife. But outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a big deal, even if the intent is to protect someone else.\n\nHowever, there's a question of whether the author has the right to involve themselves. The author was involved in the affair without knowing the man was married. They might share some responsibility for not checking into his marital status. But the main wrongdoer here is the man for cheating and lying. The author is now trying to correct their mistake by informing the wife, which is a positive step.\n\nThe dilemma is whether exposing the affair requires outing his sexuality. If the only way to inform the wife is by revealing his sexuality, then the author is in a tough spot. If there's a way to report the infidelity without disclosing his orientation, that might be better. But if it's necessary to out him, then the author has to weigh the wife's right to know against his right to privacy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the one who cheated. They were misled. The author is now in a position to help the wife, which is a moral duty. However, outing someone's sexuality without consent is a serious action. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they should consider if there's a way to do it without outing him. If not, then there's a conflict between two ethical obligations. The author's primary wrong might be in participating in the affair without knowing the marital status, but the current dilemma is about rectifying that mistake. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
