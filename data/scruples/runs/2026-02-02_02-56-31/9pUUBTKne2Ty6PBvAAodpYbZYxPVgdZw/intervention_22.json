  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a complicated situation. They had a sexual relationship with someone who's married and closeted. The person they're involved with is a married man, which makes the user uncomfortable because they've been cheated on before and know how awful it feels. They want to tell the wife about the cheating but are worried about outing him to his family, especially since his parents might not react well to knowing he's gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intentions. They were initially asked not to spread the information about his sexuality, and they respected that. However, they found out the man is married and cheating. The user is conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nIs the user in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating? Well, the man is the one who's being unfaithful, so the user isn't the one committing the infidelity. However, the user is part of an affair, which complicates things. But the main issue here is whether the user is in the wrong for potentially outing him while telling the wife about the cheating.\n\nEthically, the user might feel a duty to inform the wife about the cheating, but doing so would also out him. There's a conflict between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy. The user has to weigh these two interests. If the user doesn't have a legal obligation to report the cheating, the moral obligation is debatable. The user might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they have to consider the consequences of outing him.\n\nAlso, the user might not have the right to out someone else's partner unless there's a direct relationship or obligation. Since the user isn't directly involved with the wife, stepping in could lead to unintended consequences. The user's care for the man's well-being and his family's situation suggests they're not malicious, but the act of informing the wife could still be seen as crossing a line.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's intentions are mixed. They want to do the right thing but are caught between two wrongs. The answer hinges on whether the user's actions are justified in revealing the cheating without outing him, which might not be possible. Since the user isn't the one committing the infidelity, they might not be in the wrong, but they also aren't obligated to inform the wife. However, the act of telling the wife could still be seen as interfering in a relationship they're not part of, which complicates the moral stance.\n"
