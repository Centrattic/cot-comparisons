I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out his sexuality. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They both knew not to tell anyone, but the author found out he's married and cheating. Now they're conflicted between the wife's right to know and not outing him.\n\nThe man is in a vulnerable position because his family might not accept his sexuality, and he's not ready to come out. The author has a moral dilemma. If they tell the wife, they protect her but force him out of the closet, which could harm him and his family. If they stay silent, the wife remains unaware of the cheating.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't know he was married when they started the affair, so their initial actions weren't malicious. The question is about exposing the cheater. The author's intent is to inform the wife but it out him. The problem is that outing someone without their consent is generally wrong, especially if it's against their wishes and could lead to family issues. \n\nBut there's also the wife's right to know she's been cheated on. However, the author isn't directly responsible for the cheating. The ethical choice here is tricky. The author isn't the one who cheated; they're trying to balance two wrongs. The main issue is that outing him without a way to do it discreetly could cause more harm than good. The author might have a duty to the wife, but they can't force her to know if it means outing him in a harmful way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they proceed, they might be violating his privacy and trust. The answer leans towards A (they are in the wrong) because outing him without a way to protect his privacy and considering the potential family issues is harmful. However, if there's a way to inform the wife without outing him, that's a different scenario. Since the author hasn't found such a method, the action would still be wrong. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
