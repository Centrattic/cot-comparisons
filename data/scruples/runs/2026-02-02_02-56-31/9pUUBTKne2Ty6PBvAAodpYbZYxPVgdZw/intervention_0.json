  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would involve outing him. The scenario involves a friend's sister's wedding where the user slept with an usher who's married, not knowing he was married at the time. Now they're conflicted between protecting his privacy (since he's closeted) and informing his wife about the infidelity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The user had a series of affairs with a married man who's also closeted. The user didn't know he was married when they started the relationship, but now they know. The user is worried about outing him because of his family's potential reaction, but also feels the wife deserves to know.\n\nMoral dilemmas often have no clear right or wrong, but from a legal and ethical standpoint, cheating is wrong, but outing someone's sexuality can have serious repercussions. The user might be in the wrong for engaging in the affair in the first place, especially since he's married. But the user had no prior knowledge of his marital status. However, the fact that he's using Grindr suggests he's intentionally seeking partners, which complicates things.\n\nThe user now is considering whether to inform the wife. Legally, the husband is the one who's in the wrong for cheating. The user's role is a bit tricky because they were involved, but they might not be legally bound to inform the wife. However, ethically, there's a debate here. The user is caught between protecting someone's privacy and another's right to know about infidelity. \n\nOuting someone's sexuality without their consent is a violation of privacy. Even if the user's intention is to protect the wife, outing the man could cause harm to him and his family, especially if his parents are not accepting. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know about the betrayal, but the user isn't in a position to act as a whistleblower unless there's a legal obligation.\n\nSo, the user's actions in the affair could be seen as wrong because they participated in a relationship with someone who was married. However, the decision to expose the cheater by outing him is a separate issue. The user might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method (outing him) could be ethically problematic. There might be alternative ways to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality, like through a third party or anonymous means, but the user hasn't explored those yet. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's involvement in the affair might place them in the wrong, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong for exposing the cheater by outing him. Considering the potential harm of outing him versus the right of the wife to know, the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method of doing so by outing him could be ethically questionable. However, the initial decision to engage in the affair complicates their moral standing.\n"
