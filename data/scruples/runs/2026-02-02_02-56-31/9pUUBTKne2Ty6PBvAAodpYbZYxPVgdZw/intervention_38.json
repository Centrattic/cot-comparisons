  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation involves a complex mix of personal relationships, secrets, and ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the user had a one-night stand with an usher at their friend's sister's wedding and later found out the man is married and has children. They've been seeing each other multiple times after, but the man is in the closet about his sexuality. The user is now conflicted about whether to expose him to his wife, which would out him, or stay silent.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they're in the wrong if they decide to expose the cheater, even though it means outing him. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nLooking at the scenario, the user didn't know the man was married when they started the affair. The man was upfront about being in the closet and asked for secrecy. The user respected that initially. Now, they're trying to do the right thing by informing the wife about the infidelity. However, doing so would reveal his sexuality, which he hasn't shared with his family yet, and the family is described as traditional (his parents might react badly to him being gay).\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a conflict between the wife's right to know about the cheating and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The user is trying to decide between these two.\n\nIf the user reveals the infidelity, they are acting in the wife's interest, which could be seen as just. However, outing him against his wishes might be a violation of his privacy and potentially harm his family relationships. On the other hand, if the user doesn't act, the wife remains deceived, and the cheating continues.\n\nThe user's actions are driven by a desire to correct a wrong (the infidelity) once they became aware of it. They didn't know initially, and the man withheld information about his marital status. The user is now trying to mitigate the damage. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for taking action that might out him to protect the wife.\n\nFrom a consequentialist perspective, the user might be trying to prevent further harm to the wife and family. But from a deontological angle, they might be violating the man's confidentiality. However, the man was deceptive in his relationship, which complicates the ethics. The user might not be in the wrong because they're acting to correct a wrong done by someone else (the cheating spouse). The user's intent is to inform the wife, which is a separate issue from outing him. However, the means of informing might inadvertently out him. If possible, the user could find a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality, but if not, they might have to choose between two harms.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, there's a duty to prevent harm, so informing the wife could be justified. However, the potential harm to the man's family and his personal life is significant. The user might not be in the wrong if they proceed with good intentions and consider the consequences, but there's no clear right answer here. The key is whether the user can find a way to inform the wife without outing the man. If that's possible, then the user is in the right. If not, the dilemma remains.\n"
