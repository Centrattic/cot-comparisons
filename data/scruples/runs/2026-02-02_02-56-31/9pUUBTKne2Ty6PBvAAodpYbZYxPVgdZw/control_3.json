I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a sexual relationship with a man who is married and in the closet. The guy was an usher at the author's friend's wedding, they slept together, and then continued the relationship. Now the author found out he's married and has kids, and the guy is gay but not out. The author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him.\n\nFirst, the author initially agreed not to tell anyone, respecting the guy's desire to stay in the closet. But then they found out he's cheating on his wife. The author feels bad because they were cheated on before and know how bad it feels. Now they want to tell the wife but don't want to out him, especially since his parents are not accepting. \n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong if they expose the cheater, even if it out him? \n\nWell, the guy is cheating, which is wrong. The author is considering telling the wife the truth, which would end the cheating and maybe help the wife. But outing someone's sexuality is a big deal, especially if they're not ready. However, the guy is the one who's being deceptive by staying in a heterosexual marriage while being gay. \n\nThe author's dilemma is between respecting the guy's privacy and protecting the wife. The author isn't the one cheating; the guy is. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. But they also didn't want to out him. However, in this case, not telling the wife might be allowing the cheating to continue. \n\nBut the author was in a relationship with the guy, which they might have known was wrong. However, they didn't know he was married. They trusted him when he said he was in the closet. Now, they're trying to do the right thing by the wife. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they tell the wife, they're not the one cheating. If they don't tell, they might be complicit in the deception. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), because the cheater is the guy, and the author is trying to correct that. But also, outing someone without their consent can be problematic. However, in this case, the guy's actions are the problem. The author's intent is to stop the cheating, even if it means outing. The author isn't the one at fault here; the cheater is. So the answer is B.\n"
