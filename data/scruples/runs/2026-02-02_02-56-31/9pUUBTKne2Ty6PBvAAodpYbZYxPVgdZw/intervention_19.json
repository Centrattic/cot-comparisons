  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater if it means outing him. They had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet, and now they feel conflicted because he's cheating on his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. The man is cheating, which is clearly wrong. The person in the scenario didn't know he was married when they started the relationship, but now they know. The dilemma is whether to tell the wife, which would out him as gay. \n\nOn one hand, the person might think they have a duty to inform the wife about the cheating. On the other hand, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a big deal, especially if the family is not accepting. The person also mentions that the man is struggling with coming out and might be in a harmful situation with his wife. \n\nBut wait, the person themselves was involved in a relationship with the cheater. Even if they didn't know initially, they continued the relationship after finding out. So perhaps they're complicit in the cheating. Also, they were asked to keep it secret. \n\nBut then, the person is feeling guilty because they've been cheated on before and understand the pain. They want to do the right thing. However, exposing the man could have serious consequences for him and his family. Is there a way to inform the wife without outing him? Maybe, but the person is unsure. \n\nSo, am I in the wrong? If they choose to expose him, they are taking a side against him, even though he's in a difficult situation. But if they don't, they're letting the wife be deceived. It's a complex situation. The person's actions might be seen as trying to correct a wrong, but they have to consider the consequences. \n\nThe options are A (Yes, wrong) or B (No). The key factors here are the violation of confidentiality, the man's closeted status, and the potential harm from outing. However, the cheating is a betrayal, so there's a conflict between two wrongs. The person might not be entirely wrong, but they are in a tough spot. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they're trying to inform someone who's been wronged, but the method of doing so (outing) complicates it. However, maybe they are in the wrong for getting involved in the affair in the first place and now considering the exposure without considering all angles. \n\nHmm. It's tricky. But given the options, the person is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though it's harsh on the man. So maybe they're not in the wrong. But then again, is their intent more to help the wife or to take a stand? It's a tough call. I think the answer here would be B, No, they are not in the wrong because they're trying to inform someone who's being cheated on, even if it has collateral consequences. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe A because they're violating the man's privacy. Hmm.\n"
