  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. They had an affair with a married man who is in the closet. The man is married with kids, and the user found out he's cheating through their relationship.\n\nFirst, the user had consensual relations with the man who was married. The man asked them not to reveal his sexuality, and they agreed. Now, they're conflicted because they want to tell the wife about the infidelity but don't want to out him. \n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, cheating is a personal matter between the individuals involved. The user's role here is complicated because they were part of the affair. However, the key issue is whether they have a moral obligation to the wife. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity, but exposing the husband's sexuality without his consent could have serious consequences for him, especially if his family is not accepting.\n\nThe user's decision involves weighing the wife's right to know against the husband's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. If the user tells the wife, they might be breaching the husband's confidentiality, which could lead to outing him against his wishes. However, the husband's actions (cheating) have also violated the trust in his marriage. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user was complicit in the affair. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong for deciding to expose the cheater. The user is now in a position where they have to decide between two harmful actions: outing someone's sexuality or allowing a spouse to remain unaware of infidelity. \n\nThe user's intent is to do the right thing, but the methods are problematic. Outing someone, even to protect another party, is generally considered a violation of privacy. However, the wife deserves to know about the betrayal. The user might not be entirely in the wrong because they're trying to act in good faith, but they should consider the consequences of their actions. \n\nConsidering all factors, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they need to approach the situation carefully. They should probably consult with a professional or find a way to inform the wife without outing the husband's sexuality directly. However, since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer would lean towards B (No), but with the caveat that the method needs to be more ethical.\n"
