  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is in a complicated situation here. So, they had a relationship with someone who's married and in the closet. The guy asked them not to tell anyone because he's gay and not ready to come out. Now the user found out he's cheating on his wife, and they're conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user is in the wrong. The question is whether their actions (cheating on the guy's wife by sleeping with him while he's married) make them at fault here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe guy was married and cheating, so he's clearly at fault. The user didn't know he was married when they started the affair. They were told he's gay and in the closet. But the user is now considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him. The user is torn between protecting his privacy and informing the wife about the infidelity.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for having a relationship with someone who's married unless there's a specific law against it. But morally, it's a gray area. The user didn't know about the marriage initially, but after finding out, continuing the relationship could be seen as complicity in the cheating. However, the user is also trying to do the right thing by considering exposing the cheating, which shows they have some moral compass.\n\nThe user's dilemma is about whether to prioritize the cheating spouse's privacy or the wife's right to know. The user is not the one who committed the infidelity; the guy did. The user is in a position where they have to decide between two unethical actions: outing the man or letting the wife be deceived.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the user isn't the cheater. They were deceived about the man's marital status. However, they did engage in a relationship knowing he's gay but not knowing he's married. So maybe they have some responsibility for not checking into his marital status? But since the guy hid that, the user can't be blamed for not knowing. \n\nThe user's main conflict is about whether to report the infidelity. If they do, they out the man, which could cause family turmoil. If they don't, the wife remains in the dark. The user is trying to do the right thing, even though it's a tough choice.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, they are not in the wrong) because the user didn't know the man was married when they started the relationship and is now trying to do the right thing by confronting the situation.\n"
