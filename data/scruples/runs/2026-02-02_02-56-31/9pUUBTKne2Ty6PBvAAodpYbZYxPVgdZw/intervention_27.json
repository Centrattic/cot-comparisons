I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is in a situation where they had a relationship with a man who's married, and he's also gay and in the closet. They found out he's cheating, and now they're considering exposing him to his wife but it would out him, which he hasn't done yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The user was aware he was in the closet and promised not to out him. They had a relationship without knowing he was married, so that's a key point. Now that he's cheating, the user is conflicted between protecting his privacy and informing the wife.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. Let's break it down. Did the user do something wrong initially? They slept with someone who later revealed being married. But the user didn't know he was married when they started. However, they did have multiple encounters after knowing he was in the closet but not his marital status. Wait, when did they find out he's married? The user found out a week ago. So after the initial incident and subsequent hookups, the user didn't know about the marriage until later. So the user might have been in a relationship with someone who was cheating. But the user was the other person in the affair.\n\nNow, the user is considering exposing this to the wife. The question is whether the user is in the wrong to do so. The user is trying to decide between outing him (which he asked not to do) and informing the wife. If they tell the wife, it would out him because the wife would figure out he's gay. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between the right to privacy (his) and the right to know (the wife's). The user was complicit in the affair, so maybe they have a responsibility to inform the wife. However, the user also made a promise not to out him. But since the user is now considering exposing him to the wife, even if it's to tell the truth, the user might be in a gray area. \n\nBut the user is not the one who broke the promise first. The husband cheated, so the user might feel justified in telling the wife. However, the user's initial actions (sleeping with him knowing he was in the closet) could be seen as wrong. But they didn't know he was married. So the user's initial involvement is complicated. \n\nIn terms of the question: if the user exposes him by telling the wife, are they in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, the user is helping to end the cheating. On the other, they're outing him which he didn't want. But the wife's right to know might override the husband's privacy. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong for exposing the cheating, even if it out him. But the user was part of the affair, so they might share some blame. \n\nBut the user is asking if they are in the wrong in the situation. The answer hinges on whether their action of informing the wife is wrong. If the user is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if it out the husband, they might not be in the wrong. However, their own involvement in the affair could be seen as wrong, but that's separate from the question of whether exposing him is the right move now.\n"
