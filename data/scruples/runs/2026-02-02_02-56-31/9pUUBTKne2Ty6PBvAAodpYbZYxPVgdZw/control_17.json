I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had an affair with a married man who's in the closet. They knew he was gay but didn't out him initially because he wasn't ready. Now, the author found out the man is married with kids and wants to tell the wife about the infidelity to prevent further cheating. The dilemma is whether exposing the cheater by informing the wife would out him, which could have negative consequences for him and his family.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The author had an affair, which is ethically questionable because it's cheating. The man asked for secrecy, and the author agreed. However, the man is married, so the affair is indeed a betrayal. The author's intention is to protect the wife, but doing so would out the man, which could be harmful given his family's potential reaction.\n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but morally, it's complex. The author is in a position where they want to do the right thing by the wife but are conflicted about outing the man. The question is whether the author's intention (protecting the wife) justifies the means (outing him). \n\nIf the author tells the wife, they might be protecting the wife's rights to know, but they're also violating the man's privacy. However, the man is the one who initiated the affair, and the wife has a right to know if her husband is cheating. The ethical dilemma is balancing these two interests. \n\nSome might argue that the author, as an accomplice to the cheating, should keep quiet. Others might say the wife has a right to know. The author's actions in the affair (sleeping with a married man) are problematic, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the act of outing the man complicates things. However, the initial affair itself is the main issue. The user is asking if the author is wrong for planning to expose the cheater, which would involve outing him. Since the author's actions (the affair) were wrong, they might be in a position where their intent to correct that wrong by informing the wife could be seen as a moral obligation, but the method (outing) is ethically tricky. \n\nBut the core issue is the author's role in the affair. They are in a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. So, the author is complicit in the cheating. Therefore, they could be considered in the wrong for being part of the affair. However, their intent to inform the wife might be seen as trying to make amends. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's intention is justified despite the potential harm to the man. If the author is acting in the wife's interest, some might argue it's justified. But others might say the author should not have been involved in the affair in the first place, making them complicit. \n\nIn summary, the author's initial involvement in the affair is a moral wrong. The decision to expose the cheater is complicated but their primary wrongdoing was participating in the affair. So, the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because the author was part of the cheating relationship, which is ethically wrong, regardless of their intent to inform the wife later.\n"
