I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step. \n\nThe author is a 20-year-old man who had a series of sexual encounters with a 23-year-old male usher at their best friend's sister's wedding. The usher, who is married with two kids, is gay but closeted and asked the author not to tell anyone. The author respected his privacy initially but later found out he was married and cheating. Now the author is torn between exposing the cheating husband (which would out him as gay) and keeping quiet to avoid causing family issues.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with someone who was married. That's a problem because it's adultery. The author might be complicit in the cheating. But the key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheating, which would out the man as gay.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to privacy too. The man cheated and lied about his status. The author might feel betrayed and want the wife to know. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent, even if they've cheated, is a violation of their privacy. The author promised not to out him. The dilemma is about whether the harm of cheating justifies breaching that promise.\n\nThe author is considering exposing the man's infidelity, which would reveal his sexuality. The man's parents are traditional and might not handle it well, which the author is concerned about. The author is also aware that the man might not be the only person he cheated with, so there's a potential for ongoing harm to the wife.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they expose the man, they're breaking a trust (the man's request for confidentiality) and possibly causing family distress. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The author is in a tricky position because they're trying to balance two wrongs: the man's cheating and outing him against the wife's right to know. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a breach of confidentiality, but they might also be trying to right a wrong by informing the wife. However, the author's own participation in the affair could mean they have some responsibility for the situation. If they were in a relationship with him, it might be different, but since it's casual, the moral obligation is less clear.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, cheating is morally wrong, and outing someone is also a violation of privacy. But the author's intent here is to inform the wife, which could be seen as a moral act. However, the method (outing) is questionable. There's a conflict between the duty to the wife and the promise to the man.\n\nI think the author is in a difficult spot, but by having an affair with a married man, they contributed to the problem. However, the main question is whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing the cheating. Since the man is cheating and the author wants to inform the wife, that's a valid concern. But the act of outing him without his consent is a separate issue. So the author is not entirely in the wrong, but there are complexities. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), because the wife's right to know might outweigh the breach of confidentiality, but it's a close call.\n"
