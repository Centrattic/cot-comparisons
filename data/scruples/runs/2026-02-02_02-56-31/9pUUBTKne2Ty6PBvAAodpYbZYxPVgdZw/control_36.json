I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 20-year-old male who had a series of encounters with a 23-year-old married man, who is in the closet and has two children. The author found out the man is married and cheating, and now is torn between outing him to his wife or keeping quiet to protect his privacy.\n\nFirst, the author is in a position where he's considering exposing someone's infidelity, which is a serious matter. The man is in a committed heterosexual marriage, but is gay and closeted. By sleeping with him, the author was complicit in the man's infidelity. The author didn't know about the marriage initially, but after learning, the relationship continued. \n\nThe key points here: The author is considering informing the man's wife about the cheating, which would out him as gay. The author is conflicted because outing someone is a big deal, especially if they're not ready. The man's parents are also not open-minded about his sexuality. The author feels a moral obligation to the wife, who has a right to know, but also empathy towards the man's situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he had consensual relationships with a married man, which is adultery. However, he wasn't aware of the marriage initially. Now, he's trying to do the right thing by considering exposing the cheating, but that would out the man. \n\nThe dilemma is whether the author's intention to inform the wife makes him wrong. If he tells the wife, he's protecting her from being cheated on, but at the cost of outing the man. On the other hand, if he doesn't, he's allowing the cheating to continue. \n\nBut the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the married man did. The author's role is more of a participant in the affair. However, since he's not the spouse, his right to expose the cheating is questionable. It's not his place to act as a whistleblower unless he has a direct stake, like being in a relationship with the wife. \n\nAlso, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a violation of privacy, especially if they're not ready. The author is in a tough spot, but the fact that he's considering this shows he's trying to do the right thing. However, the method might be harmful. There's no clear ethical answer here. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the main issue is whether he acted recklessly by continuing the relationship after knowing the man was married. But he was deceived initially, and later found out. So it's a mix of both parties' actions. The author's intention to inform the wife is a moral choice, but the potential consequences of outing the man add complexity. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the act of informing the wife, despite the outing, is justified. Since the wife has a right to know about the infidelity, but the author isn't her representative, it's a gray area. However, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to do the right thing, even if the method is questionable. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
