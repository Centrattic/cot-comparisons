  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is dealing with a complex situation where they're involved in a relationship with someone who's married and closeted. They want to expose the cheating but don't want to out him to his family. The main question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user had a consensual relationship with the married man. They didn't know he was married when they started, which complicates things. The man is in a closeted situation, so outing him would have serious repercussions, especially with his family. The user feels conflicted between the wife's right to know and not wanting to cause harm to the man's family.\n\nLegally, in many places, adultery isn't a crime, but ethically, it's a different matter. The user's actions were based on a lack of information, which they didn't have control over. The key issue here is the decision to expose the cheating. If the user tells the wife, it would out the man, which he's not ready for. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. \n\nMoral dilemmas often don't have clear answers. The user isn't in the wrong for being in a relationship they were unaware was with a married man. They might be in the right for not outing him, as it's his right to choose when to come out. However, withholding information from the wife could be seen as supporting the cheating. \n\nBut considering the user's intent wasn't malicious, and they were deceived themselves, the wrong here might not lie with them. The man is the one who withheld his marital status and sexual orientation. The user's dilemma is about balancing two wrongs: outing someone without consent or allowing a spouse to remain unaware of infidelity. Since they can't do both without causing harm, the user isn't in the wrong for not exposing the cheater if they choose not to out him, as it's respecting his autonomy. Alternatively, if they do choose to inform the wife, they might still not be in the wrong if they do it discreetly without outing him, but the scenario suggests that informing the wife would inherently involve outing. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's actions were based on incomplete information, and they're caught between conflicting obligations. They aren't in the wrong for the situation they're in, but the decision itself is morally gray. The best answer is B: No, they are not in the wrong.\n"
