I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The author is asking if they would be in the wrong for exposing a cheater, which would out the person as gay. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author, who's 20, had a one-night stand with a 23-year-old man at their best friend's sister's wedding. The man was an usher. He told the author he's gay but not out yet. The author agreed not to tell anyone. They became friends and had multiple encounters. Later, the author found out the man is married to a woman with two kids. The wife was away during the wedding. The author now feels bad and wants to tell the wife about the cheating, but it would out him. The dilemma is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They had a sexual relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. So, the author is also at fault here. But the main question is about whether it's wrong to expose the cheater, thereby outing him.\n\nThe man is in a closeted situation. The author is considering telling the wife, which would out him. The author is conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nFrom a legal and moral standpoint, cheating is a violation of the marriage. The wife has a right to know if her spouse is being unfaithful. However, outting someone without consent can be harmful, especially in a family that might be unsupportive. The author might be causing harm to the man's family relations if they out him. But the wife's right to know is also significant.\n\nHowever, the author is also part of this situation. They had a consensual affair with someone who was in a committed relationship. The author's actions contributed to the problem. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for entering into the affair in the first place.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. If the author decides to tell the wife, they are fulfilling a moral obligation to inform the wronged party. But the method of doing so (outing him) complicates things. There might be a way to inform the wife without explicitly outing the man, but the author might not know the details. If outing is necessary to inform the wife, then the author is in a tough spot. \n\nOn the other hand, the author made a promise not to out the man, so breaking that promise could be seen as a betrayal. However, the man was already cheating, which is a separate issue. The author's moral dilemma is about balancing two wrongs: keeping the secret and allowing the wife to be deceived, or telling the truth but causing the man's outing.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for exposing the cheater? If the author's intention is to inform the wife about the cheating, which is a valid concern, but it leads to outing the man, then it's a complex situation. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but the method might be questionable. However, since the author was part of the affair, their judgment might be clouded. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. If the act of exposing is necessary to inform the wife, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the wife has a right to know. However, if the author is doing it out of spite or to humiliate the man, then they are in the wrong. The scenario seems to suggest the author is conflicted and trying to do the right thing, so maybe they are not in the wrong. Alternatively, since the author was complicit in the affair, they might bear some responsibility.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author is trying to inform the wronged party about the infidelity, which is a moral duty. But the author's own actions in the affair are problematic. However, the question is specifically about whether exposing the cheater is wrong. Given that the wife has a right to know, even if it out him, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for doing so.\n"
