I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a casual relationship with someone who's married and has kids. The man is in the closet, and the author promised not to tell anyone. Now, the author is conflicted between not outing him (which they previously agreed to) and telling the wife about the cheating.\n\nSo, the main points here are the initial agreement to keep the man's secret, the fact that the author knew he was in a committed relationship and had kids, and the moral dilemma of whether to expose the cheating by outing him. \n\nThe author is in a morally ambiguous situation. They were in a consensual relationship with the man, even though he was married. The author did know he was married but didn't know about the kids initially. Now they feel bad because they've been involved in an affair and want to do the right thing by the wife, but doing so would out him, which he wasn't ready for. \n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, so the author isn't breaking any laws. But ethically, there's a conflict. The author promised not to out him, but the husband is also being unfaithful, which is a serious issue. \n\nThe key here is whether the author has a duty to the wife. The wife has a right to know if her husband is cheating, but revealing that would also out him, which could have negative consequences for him and his family. The author is trying to balance these two things. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were in an affair themselves. They knew the man was married but didn't know about the kids until later. The fact that they continued the relationship after finding out about the kids might be a point against them. However, the main question is whether telling the wife is wrong. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, they're breaking their promise to the man, but they're also helping the wife. If they don't tell, they're letting the wife be deceived and not taking responsibility for the affair. \n\nIt's a tough call. The author isn't legally wrong, but morally, there's a split. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater (which would out him), the answer depends on whose rights take precedence. The husband's right to privacy vs the wife's right to know. \n\nIn many cases, the person in an affair is considered to have some accountability. The author is part of the problem here by entering into the affair. So, even if they do tell the wife, they might still be complicit in the cheating. However, their intent is to do the right thing by the wife. \n\nI think the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to correct a wrong they were part of. But there's a nuance here. The initial affair itself is problematic, but the dilemma is about whether to expose the cheating. Since they are trying to inform the wife, which is the ethical choice, even though it has consequences for the man, they're not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
