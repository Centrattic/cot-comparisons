I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who had a series of affairs with a married man who's also gay and closeted. The author is now considering exposing the man to his wife but is conflicted about outing him in the process.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and the man had a relationship without the wife knowing. The man is married, so the author is technically involved in an affair. The author now knows the man is cheating on his wife and possibly on others via Grindr. The dilemma is whether to tell the wife, which would out him, or stay silent.\n\nThe author's actions so far: they had multiple sexual encounters with a married man, kept it secret as requested, and now are considering exposing him. The question is if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, infidelity is generally considered wrong. The author's relationship with the man is an affair, which is a breach of trust with his wife. The author also knew about the man's closeted status and promised not to out him. However, they feel a duty to the wife since she's being cheated on. But the author is now in a position where telling the truth would out the man, which could cause family issues, especially with his parents.\n\nLegally, the situation might not be a problem unless the author is directly involved in fraud or other crimes. But morally, they are part of the infidelity. The author's intent is to expose the cheater, which could be seen as doing the right thing by the wife, but it's also outing someone against their wishes. \n\nHowever, the author is also in a morally ambiguous position because they were part of the affair. They might not be in a position to act as a moral authority here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose him. \n\nThe key points here are the author's own participation in the affair and the conflict between protecting the man's privacy (as he asked) versus the wife's right to know. The author's actions in the affair might make them complicit in the cheating, which could mean they are in the wrong. However, the desire to inform the wife is a separate issue. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's participation in the affair makes them wrong, regardless of their intent to expose him. Even if their intention to tell the wife is good, the fact that they were involved in the affair could mean they are at fault. Alternatively, if they're trying to correct their own mistake by informing the wife, maybe they're not in the wrong for doing that. \n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. Since they were part of the affair, which is a betrayal of the wife, they are complicit in the cheating. Even if they want to make amends by exposing him, their initial actions were wrong. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they participated in the affair, which is the root issue here. The dilemma about exposing him is a secondary issue, but the original act of engaging in the affair is where the wrongdoing begins.\n"
