I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sleeping with a married man who is also closeted. The key points here are consent, privacy, and the author's responsibility to the wife.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know the man was married when they started their relationship. They had consensual encounters, and the man was upfront about being gay but not ready to come out. The author respected his privacy by not outing him initially. Then, after finding out about the marriage, the author is conflicted between exposing the cheating spouse to the wife and preserving the man's privacy.\n\nThe author's main dilemma is whether they have an obligation to inform the wife about the infidelity, even if it means outing him. On one hand, the wife has a right to know about the betrayal. On the other, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a serious invasion of privacy. The author also mentions considering the man's family's reaction, which might make outing him more harmful.\n\nBut wait, the author was in a consensual relationship with the married man, knowing he was in a closeted situation. The author's actions contributed to the infidelity. The question is whether they're in the wrong for potentially exposing him to his wife. Legally, the author isn't obligated to inform the wife, and ethically, the decision is complex. However, the author's role in the affair might make them complicit in the cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author isn't the one who caused the infidelity, but rather the man chose to cheat, the author's responsibility is less clear. The author is now trying to right a wrong by informing the wife, which could be seen as a moral duty. However, outing someone's sexuality can have severe consequences, so the method matters. If there's a way to inform the wife without outing him, that might be better.\n\nBut the author might not be in the wrong because they were deceived about the man's marital status. The key is whether they acted with malicious intent. The author seems remorseful and is trying to make the right choice. The wrong here could be on the man for cheating, and the author's actions are a response to that. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to address the consequences of the man's actions without unnecessary harm.\n"
