  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, but it would also out him as gay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They slept together multiple times not knowing he was married. Now, they found out he's cheating on his wife and want to tell her but are conflicted about outing him because of his family's possible reaction.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the moral dilemma between informing the wife of the cheating and outing him as gay. The user is trying to balance these two actions. Legally, cheating is a personal matter, and the user isn't legally obligated to inform the wife. However, in some cultures or legal systems, there might be different views, but generally, it's not a legal requirement.\n\nEthically, the user might feel a sense of duty to the wife because their husband is cheating. But at the same time, outing someone's sexual orientation without their consent is a violation of their privacy. The user initially promised not to out him, so breaking that trust could be problematic. Also, considering the husband's parents' potential reaction adds another layer of complexity.\n\nThe user's actions in sleeping with a married man are also part of the equation. Cheating is generally frowned upon, and the user might feel guilt from that. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong for exposing the cheater. So, the user's actions could affect their moral standing here. If they're also cheating, that might complicate their justification for exposing him.\n\nPossible solutions: The user could inform the wife anonymously, perhaps through a letter, without revealing their identity or the husband's sexual orientation. That way, the wife gets the information without the user being involved in outing him. But the user might not know the wife's contact details, making that difficult. Alternatively, the user could talk to the husband and encourage him to come out and address the cheating, which would be a more private approach. However, the husband's refusal to come out might make this ineffective.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user isn't legally in the wrong for exposing the cheating, but ethically, it's a gray area. The user is in a tough spot between two conflicting moral obligations. The answer depends on the perspective: from the wife's side, she deserves to know about the infidelity. From the husband's side, his privacy and safety regarding his sexual orientation are important. The user's actions could be seen as both justified (protecting the wife) and unjustified (violating the husband's privacy).\n\nConsidering the options, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method matters. Outing him directly is problematic. The better approach would be to find a way to inform the wife without outing him. If that's not possible, the user might have to choose between two negative outcomes. Since the user is trying to act ethically and not out him, but still wants to inform the wife, the answer leans towards not being in the wrong, but the situation is complex. So, answer B (No).\n"
