I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking whether they're in the wrong if they expose the cheater, which would out him as gay. First, I need to consider the context.\n\nThe author had a consensual relationship with someone who is married and in the closet. They didn't know he was married when they started the affair. Now they're conflicted because they want to tell the wife but don't want to out him to his family. \n\nLegally, cheating is not a crime in most places, so the author isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, it's more complex. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, but outing someone's sexuality is a big deal. They also mention that the husband is in a closeted situation and that his parents might not react well. \n\nThe key points here are consent, harm, and intent. The author's relationship was consensual, but the husband was already in a committed marriage. The author's intent to inform the wife is to prevent further harm, but the method involves outing him. \n\nHowever, the author is now trying to reconcile their morals. The dilemma is between protecting the wife's right to know and respecting the husband's privacy. Since the husband is the one who cheated, the author isn't the one who initiated the infidelity. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to correct a mistake. The husband's actions were the root of the problem, and the author is seeking to do the right thing by the wife without fully understanding the consequences. The ethical responsibility to inform the wife about the cheating might outweigh the potential harm of outing him, but the author is also considering the husband's circumstances. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
