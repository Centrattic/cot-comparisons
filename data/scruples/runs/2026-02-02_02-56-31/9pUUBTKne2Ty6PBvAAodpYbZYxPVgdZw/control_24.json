I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong in the situation described. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male usher at his best friend's sister's wedding. The usher was married with two kids, and the wife was out of the country during the wedding. The usher is gay but closeted and didn't want anyone to know. They had multiple encounters after the wedding. The author found out about the marriage and feels conflicted because he wants to tell the wife about the cheating but doesn't want to out the man as gay.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong if he decides to expose the cheating, which would also out the man's sexuality. The user is asking for a judgment between A (author is wrong) and B (not wrong).\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the author was aware that the man was married and having an affair. He says he wouldn't have slept with him if he knew. The man might not be the only person he's cheated with, as hinted by the Grindr account. The author is now considering informing the wife but is torn because it would out the man's sexuality, which could cause family issues. \n\nMoral dilemmas often involve conflicting duties. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity, but outing someone's sexuality without consent is a violation of privacy. The author is trying to balance these two. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating? Well, if the author tells the wife, it would be a form of intervention to protect her from being cheated on. However, doing so without the husband's consent could lead to outing him as gay, which is a separate issue. There's also the question of whether the author has the right to step in as a third party. \n\nBut the author is involved in the affair, so maybe he has some responsibility. However, the man is the one committing adultery, so the author's role is complicated. The author might feel guilty because he was part of the affair, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong for trying to inform the wife. \n\nOn the other hand, outing someone's sexuality without consent is generally considered a violation, even if the intention is to expose infidelity. The author might not have the right to disclose that information unless it's necessary for the wife's knowledge. \n\nSo, if the author tells the wife, he's not wrong for wanting to protect her, but the act of outing the husband's sexuality could be problematic. However, the husband's infidelity is a separate issue. The author is trying to reconcile these two. \n\nGiven that the man is cheating, there's an argument that the wife deserves to know. But the method of informing her might involve outing, which complicates things. The author's intentions are mixed: he cares about the man's well-being and doesn't want to cause family issues, but also wants to do the right thing for the wife.\n\nI think the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheating. If the author tells the wife, it's a moral decision, but the act of outing the man's sexuality might be a different issue. However, since the author is part of the affair, there's a conflict of interest. \n\nIn terms of the original question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether exposing the cheating (even if it leads to outing) is justified. The author is not the one who cheated; the husband is. The author is a participant but might not be in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, even though it's a difficult situation. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's trying to right a wrong done by the husband, even though he's involved. However, there's a nuance here. If the author is using the wife to cover his own involvement, that's different. But the scenario suggests he's genuinely conflicted and wants to make the right decision, even though it's complex. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B.\n"
