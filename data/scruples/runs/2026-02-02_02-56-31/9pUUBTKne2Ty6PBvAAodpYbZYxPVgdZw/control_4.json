I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. The guy asked him not to reveal his sexuality. The author is now conflicted because he wants to tell the wife about the cheating but doesn't want to out him. \n\nSo, the main points here are: the author had consensual relationships, the man is cheating, and the author is considering exposing this, which would reveal his sexuality. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know and the man's privacy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's being honest here. The man is cheating, which is a betrayal. The wife deserves to know if her husband is unfaithful. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a sensitive issue, especially if it could harm his family relationships. But the act of cheating is separate from his sexuality. If the author can inform the wife without explicitly outing him as gay, that might be better. But if revealing the affair inherently reveals his sexuality, then there's a conflict.\n\nBut the key here is the author's role. He was involved in a consensual affair, even if he didn't know about the marriage initially. He's not the one who cheated; the married man did. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. However, he should consider how to do it discreetly, maybe through a third party or anonymously. But since the author is the one who had the affair, he might feel responsible. However, the decision to cheat was the married man's choice. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to expose the cheating unless there's a duty to protect the wife. But in most cases, people aren't legally or morally required to report someone's infidelity unless it directly affects them. However, in this case, since the author is the one who had the affair, he might feel it's the right thing to do. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but he should be cautious about how he does it to avoid unnecessary outing. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
