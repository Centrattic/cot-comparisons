I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a sexual relationship with someone they met at a wedding. The person was married and in the closet. The author didn't know he was married at first, and after finding out, they feel conflicted about exposing him. The key points here are the author's initial consent to the relationship, their knowledge after the fact, and the potential consequences of exposing him.\n\nSo, the author had consensual relationships with a married man who is also gay. The author agreed to keep his sexuality a secret. But then discovered he's married and cheating. Now they're considering telling his wife, which would out him. The dilemma is between protecting him from being outed versus the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nFirst, is the author at fault for the relationship? The man was married, so the author was involved with someone who was cheating. However, the author didn't know he was married when the relationship started. But after finding out, they continued for some time. That might be a problem because once the author knew he was married, continuing the affair could be considered complicity in the cheating.\n\nBut the main question is whether exposing him (which would out him) makes the author in the wrong. The author is conflicted between two moral obligations: the husband's need to come out and the wife's right to know. The author might feel a duty to the wife, but outing someone without their consent is a big deal, especially if it could harm their family.\n\nLegally, the wife might have a right to know about the infidelity, but the author isn't part of that marriage. Ethically, it's complicated. The author didn't cause the cheating, but they were part of the affair. However, the author's intention to protect the man's privacy (as he asked) versus the duty to inform the spouse is a classic ethical dilemma.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they continued the relationship after knowing he was married. But if they decide to expose him to the wife, they could be doing the right thing by informing the spouse, even if it out the man. However, outing someone without a direct relationship could be seen as crossing a line. So the answer depends on whether the author is morally obligated to the wife or to the man's privacy.\n\nIn some views, the author isn't the one who cheated; the husband did. The author's role is as a participant in the affair, but not the cheater. However, by continuing the relationship after knowing, they might be complicit. But the main question is about the act of exposing him. If the author tells the wife, they might be doing the right thing for the wife but violating the man's privacy. Alternatively, if they don't, they might be enabling the cheating.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for considering telling the wife. They were deceived initially, and after discovering the truth, they have a moral dilemma. However, they were part of the affair, which is problematic. But the key is whether they are at fault for exposing the cheating. Since the husband is the one who cheated, the author's exposure is a way to inform the wife. However, outing him as gay might be a side effect, but the main issue is the infidelity. The author might not be in the wrong for choosing to inform the wife, even if it out the man. But there's a possibility that the author's choice to expose could lead to further consequences for the man, which they might be responsible for. However, the wife has a right to know. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
