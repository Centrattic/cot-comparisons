  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong if they expose a cheater who is married and in the closet. So, the situation is complicated. \n\nFirst, the person had a relationship with someone they met at a wedding, who is married and gay. They found out about the marriage and kids later and felt bad because they were cheated on themselves. Now they want to tell the wife but are worried about outing the man. \n\nSo, the main points here are confidentiality vs. informing the wife. The user initially promised not to tell anyone because the man was in the closet. But now they have a moral obligation to the wife, right? The user might think they have a duty to inform the wife about the infidelity. However, outing someone's sexuality is a serious matter, especially if the family isn't accepting. \n\nOn one hand, the user might not be in the wrong because they're trying to protect the wife from being cheated on. On the other hand, they might be in the wrong for breaching the man's privacy, even if he was wrong. Also, is there a way to tell the wife without outing him? Maybe, but the user might not know. \n\nBut let's think about the user's actions. They had a relationship with a married person, which is cheating. They knew he was in the closet and promised not to out him. Then they continued the relationship after finding out. So, maybe they are partially at fault for the initial affair. However, the question is about exposing the cheater now. \n\nIf they tell the wife, they're protecting the wife's rights, but if they don't, they might be enabling the cheating. But the user's dilemma is whether they're in the wrong for exposing the cheater even if it means outing him. The answer might depend on the ethical balance between the two wrongs: cheating vs. outing someone. \n\nIn some perspectives, the user isn't in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing by the wife. But in another angle, they're violating the man's privacy. However, since the man is cheating, there's an argument that the wife has a right to know. \n\nBut the user might be in the wrong for getting involved in the affair in the first place. However, the question is about the current dilemma. The answer is likely B (No), because the user is trying to do the right thing, even if the method is ethically gray. They're in a tough spot between two bad options.\n"
