I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old man who had multiple sexual encounters with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. The usher is married with two kids, and the author found out he's cheating on his wife. The usher is also closeted, and the author is considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him as gay. The author is conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and not wanting to out the usher, especially since his family might not accept his sexuality.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the author in the wrong here? Let's break down the aspects. The author had consensual relationships with the usher, who was married. The key issue here is the author's involvement with a married man, which is an affair. Even though the usher is gay, the author knew he was married at the time of their encounters. That's cheating on the wife's part. So, from the wife's perspective, the author is a third party who participated in her husband's infidelity. \n\nBut the author is now considering exposing the husband to the wife. Legally, while the author might have the right to speak up, ethically it's tricky. The author is in a position where they had a secret, consensual relationship with someone who was in a committed marriage. By exposing the husband, the author is acting as a whistleblower, but that's complicating because they were complicit in the affair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife so she knows she's been cheated on. However, there's also the consideration of outing someone without their consent, especially when it comes to their sexuality. The usher is not ready to come out, and the author is worried about family tensions. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author's actions led them to be in this position. They knew the usher was married but continued the relationship. That's part of the problem. The author might have a moral obligation to the wife, but there's also the fact that they were involved in a deceitful relationship themselves. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author is partially at fault for engaging in an affair with a married person. The decision to expose the husband is complicated, but the initial actions (sleeping with a married person) make the author complicit in the cheating. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they participated in the infidelity, even if they're now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife. The act of cheating is a clear breach of the husband's marriage, and the author's role in that makes them partially responsible.\n"
