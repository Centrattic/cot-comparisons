I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a male usher, who is married and in the closet. The author didn't know about the marriage at first and now feels conflicted because he wants to tell the wife but also doesn't want to out the man.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He had a relationship with someone who was already married and cheating. Even though the usher is in the closet, the author was aware he's gay, which adds another layer here. The moral dilemma is whether exposing the cheating (which would out him) is justified.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The author was in a consensual relationship, but the usher is the one who broke vows with his wife. The author didn't know about the marriage initially, so maybe that's a point in his favor. But once he found out, continuing the relationship might be considered wrong because he was part of an affair.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheat. On one hand, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. On the other hand, outing someone's sexuality without consent could be a violation of privacy. The author is trying to balance these two things.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong now. If he decides to tell the wife, is that his fault? Or if he stays quiet, is that complicity in the cheating?\n\nThe author's main issue is that he's trying to do the right thing but is caught between conflicting obligations. However, the original act of having a relationship with a married man (who is cheating) is part of the problem. So the author might share some responsibility here. But the main question is about the exposure. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, he's protecting her but outing the husband. If he doesn't, he's letting the husband continue the deceit. Either way, there are consequences. But the initial relationship might be where the author's wrongdoing starts. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater. \n\nIn terms of WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...), the community often weighs intentions and consequences. The author's intention is to do the right thing by the wife, even though it means outing the husband. The husband's actions were deceptive, and the author was also deceived. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's position is complicated. He's caught in a situation where either choice has drawbacks. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe he's not entirely at fault because he's trying to rectify the situation. The original relationship might be a point against him, but the question is about exposing the cheater. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it's a tough choice. The initial relationship is problematic, but the act of exposing the cheater isn't necessarily his fault, given the circumstances.\n"
