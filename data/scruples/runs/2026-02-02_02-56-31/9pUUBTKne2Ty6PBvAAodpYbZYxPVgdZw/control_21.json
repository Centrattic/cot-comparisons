I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone they met at a wedding. The usher was married, and the author found out he was cheating. Now, the author is considering exposing the cheater to the wife, even though it would out him as gay, which he's not ready for. The author is conflicted between the wife's right to know and the usher's privacy.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is planning to tell the wife about the infidelity, which would reveal the usher's sexuality. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. \n\nOn one hand, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. On the other, outing someone against their will is a serious matter. The author also mentions the usher's family might not accept his sexuality, adding another layer of harm. \n\nThe author's actions could cause emotional distress to the usher, his family, and the wife. However, the wife is being wronged in the relationship. The author is trying to protect the usher's privacy but is also considering exposing the infidelity. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between the duty to prevent harm (to the wife) and respecting privacy (the usher's). But since the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity, maybe they aren't obligated to act. However, the author is in a position where they could expose the truth. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for wanting to tell? If they do, they might be causing unintended consequences. However, if they don't, they might be enabling the ongoing cheating. The author's own actions (sleeping with the married usher) were also unethical, which complicates things. \n\nThe author was in a relationship with the married person, which is cheating. That puts them in a morally ambiguous position. Their decision to expose the infidelity could be self-serving, especially since they were involved in the affair. So, their motives might not be entirely altruistic. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be seen as problematic because they were complicit in the cheating and now are in a position to expose someone else. They might be using the wife's right to know as justification, but their own ethical standing is shaky. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for both participating in the infidelity and then considering exposing the cheater in a way that harms him further. The answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
