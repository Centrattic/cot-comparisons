  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is dealing with a moral dilemma here. They had a relationship with someone they met at a wedding, who turned out to be married. The person is also gay and in the closet. The user is considering exposing the cheating but doesn't want to out him because of his family's potential reaction. They also feel the wife has a right to know.\n\nFirst, looking at the facts: the user slept with someone who was married without knowing. The person is in a closeted situation, which complicates things. The user found out later and now is conflicted between the wife's right to know and not wanting to out the man.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the user's actions were consensual but based on a lack of full knowledge. They didn't know he was married, so they weren't intentionally cheating. However, they did engage in a relationship that led to infidelity. The user is now in a position where they have information that could affect multiple people.\n\nThe key issue here is the user's responsibility. They didn't know he was married when they started the relationship, but after finding out, they have a dilemma. Outing him could prevent the wife from discovering the truth through other means, but it also violates his privacy. On the other hand, staying silent might allow the cheating to continue, which is a betrayal to the wife.\n\nLegal and ethical perspectives vary. Legally, the user isn't doing anything illegal by not informing the wife, but ethically, it's a gray area. The user isn't obligated to intervene, but if they feel morally responsible, they might want to act.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? They didn't know he was married initially. They were deceived. But after knowing, they have a choice. The initial relationship was based on a lack of information. The user's actions were consensual and not malicious. However, if they choose to expose the cheater, they might be causing further harm by outing him. If they don't, the wife remains unaware. \n\nConsidering all angles, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for having the relationship. They were misled. The wrong here is more on the cheater for not being truthful. The user's current dilemma is about choosing between two difficult options, but neither choice makes them the one at fault for the original situation.\n"
