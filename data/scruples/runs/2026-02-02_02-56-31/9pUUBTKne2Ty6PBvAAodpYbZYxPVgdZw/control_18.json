I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is someone who had a series of affairs with a married man who's in the closet about being gay. The key points here are that the man is cheating on his wife, and the author is considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him. The author is conflicted between wanting to inform the wife about the affair and not wanting to out him to his family, who might not accept his sexuality.\n\nSo, the author's actions started with having a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. That's a big part of the issue. The author knew he was in the closet, so maybe they were aware of the potential consequences of being exposed. Now, they want to tell the wife, which would out him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is wrong, so the author is part of that. The man is the one who's married and cheating, but the author also had consensual affairs. The author's moral dilemma is about exposing the man, but they also contributed to the infidelity. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, they're protecting the wife from being cheated on, but they're also outing someone without consent. However, if they don't tell, they're letting the cheating continue. But the author's role here is complicated because they were part of the cheating. \n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but morally, the author might be in the wrong for both cheating and then considering exposing someone to end it. The question is whether the act of exposing him is wrong. If the author is trying to prevent further harm to the wife, maybe they have a point, but they also were complicit in the affair. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's actions (cheating and then considering exposing) make them at fault. Since the author was involved in the affair, they might share some responsibility. However, if they're trying to right a wrong by informing the wife, that's a different angle. But the act of outing someone without consent is a violation of privacy, which could make the author wrong regardless of intent. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in the wrong for being part of the affair and then considering outing the man without his consent, which complicates their position. The answer is A.\n"
