  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person (20M) had a relationship with a married man (23M) who's in the closet. The man is married with two kids, and the wife's away. They had multiple encounters. The user found out about the marriage and feels guilty for cheating on someone who has been cheated on before. Now they're torn between protecting the cheater's privacy and informing the wife, which would out him, potentially causing family issues.\n\nThe user is asking if they'd be in the wrong (WIBTA) for telling the wife, even if it out the man. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, the ethical dilemma here is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The user is concerned about outing someone who's not ready to come out. \n\nFirst, the user was deceived. The man lied about his relationship status. The user didn't know he was married when they started the relationship. So, the user might feel they were also a victim here. However, they had a consensual relationship with a married man, which is an affair. That could be seen as contributing to the problem.\n\nThe user's intention to inform the wife is to prevent further harm. But by doing so, they'd out the man, possibly against his wishes. The man is in a closeted situation, and his parents might not accept his sexuality. So, outing him could have serious consequences for him and his family.\n\nIn terms of morality, is the user obligated to tell the wife? Some might argue the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. Others might say the user shouldn't take on the role of a whistleblower without considering the consequences. Also, the user might not have direct evidence of the man's other infidelities (Grindr account), so there's a possibility of false accusations.\n\nThe user's guilt over cheating on someone who was cheated on before adds emotional weight. They want to do the right thing but are conflicted. \n\nConsidering all angles: the user is in a position of knowing private information. They were part of an affair that was deceitful on both sides. The man lied about his relationship status, but he's also closeted. The user's action could prevent the wife from being hurt further but at the cost of the man's privacy. \n\nIn legal terms, cheating isn't a crime, so the user isn't legally obligated to report it. Ethically, it's a gray area. If the user chooses to out the man, they might be seen as violating his privacy. However, if they don't, the wife remains unaware of the betrayal. \n\nThe user might need to consider alternative actions, like informing the wife anonymously or encouraging the man to come clean. But the question is whether the user is in the wrong if they do go ahead with exposing him, thus outing him. \n\nGiven the complexity, the answer might be that they are in the wrong (A) because they were involved in a deceitful relationship and now choosing to out someone, regardless of the reasons, could be considered crossing ethical lines. However, others might argue they're not in the wrong (B) because they're trying to prevent harm to the wife, even if it means difficult consequences for the man. \n\nBut in this case, since the user was part of the affair without knowing the full truth, their decision to expose might be seen as taking responsibility for the mistake. However, the act of outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a violation of privacy, which is a significant ethical issue. The user's initial agreement to keep the affair secret adds another layer\u2014they broke that promise, which could be seen as the wrong in itself.\n\nSo, considering the act of breaking the man's confidentiality and outing him, the answer leaning towards A (they are in the wrong) makes sense. But if the primary action is the exposure of the cheating, which is a separate issue, it's a bit more nuanced. However, since outing someone's sexuality is a major privacy violation, the answer is likely A.\n"
