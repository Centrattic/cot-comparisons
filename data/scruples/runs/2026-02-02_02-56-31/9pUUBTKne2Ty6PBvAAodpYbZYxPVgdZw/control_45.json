I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him. Let me break itown.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male, who is married and a father. The author didn't know the man was married, which adds some context. The man asked the author not to tell anyone because he's in the closet. Now the author found out about the marriage and is considering telling the wife, which would out the man.\n\nSo, the author's dilemma is between respecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and exposing the cheating (which would require outing him). The key points here are the man's request for confidentiality and the author's possible obligation to the wife.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a conflict between not betraying someone's trust (the man's privacy) and preventing harm to another person (the wife being cheated on). The author is concerned about the wife's right to know, but also about the consequences of outing the man, especially given his family's potential reaction.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in many places, adultery isn't illegal anymore, but it's still a breach of trust in a marriage. However, the legal issue of outing someone as gay can vary, but in most cases, it's not illegal to disclose someone's sexuality if it's true, though it's ethically complex.\n\nEthically, the author's actions depend on the potential consequences. Telling the wife would out the man against his will, which could lead to family turmoil, job issues, etc. But not telling the wife leaves her in the dark about being cheated on. However, the author isn't the one responsible for the infidelity; they were a victim of the cheater's actions.\n\nThe author's own actions\u2014engaging in a relationship without knowing the man was married\u2014are questionable. But the main issue is whether they're now in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating by outing the man. Since the man is the one who violated the marriage, the author isn't directly at fault for wanting to inform the wife, but they have to consider the man's wishes and the consequences.\n\nThere's also the angle of the author's own moral conflict. They feel guilty for being part of the affair, which complicates their decision. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. Since the exposure would involve outing the man, the author has to weigh the harm of the infidelity against the harm of outing someone.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the act of outing someone is a serious matter. However, the author's own role in the situation is a factor. They might not be in the wrong because they were misled, but the decision to out the man involves complex ethical considerations. The answer might be B (No), as the author's intention is to prevent harm to the wife, albeit with potential consequences for the man. But it's a tough call. Alternatively, if the author is complicit by being part of the affair, maybe A. But the main question is about the exposure now, so the answer is likely B.\n"
