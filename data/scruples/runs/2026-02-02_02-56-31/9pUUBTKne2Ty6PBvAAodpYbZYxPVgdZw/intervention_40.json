  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. So, the main issue here is that the individual had multiple affairs with a man who is married and also hiding his sexuality. The person is now considering exposing the cheater, which would also out him as gay. They're torn between the husband's privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The man is in a committed marriage and is cheating, which is a betrayal. The person in question didn't know he was married, so they might not be at fault for the initial affair. But now, after finding out, they have to decide whether to inform the wife. \n\nOn one hand, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. On the other hand, outing someone as gay without their consent could be harmful, especially if the family is not accepting. The person is concerned about family tensions. \n\nBut here's the thing: the man is already cheating, which is a form of betrayal. By keeping this secret, the person might be enabling the ongoing cheating. However, they also respected his wish to stay closeted. The person might not be in the wrong for the affair itself but now has a dilemma about reporting it. \n\nIs there a way to inform the wife without outing the man? Maybe through the man's actions, the wife can deduce it. But the person might not have that information. If they decide to tell the wife, they could be seen as violating the man's privacy, but they might also be protecting the wife. \n\nSo, the person is in a tough spot. They aren't necessarily in the wrong for the initial affair because they were unaware. The main question is whether they should expose the cheater. If they do, they might be helping the wife but hurting the man. If they don't, they're letting the cheating continue. \n\nBut are they responsible for the cheater's actions? Probably not. The key is whether they crossed a line by planning to expose him. Since they were in a relationship with him, they have a duty to inform the wife, but they also have the man's confidentiality to consider. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the person might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, as the cheater is the one who lied. However, the method of doing so is complicated. So the answer might be B (No), because the person isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him, given the circumstances. But maybe there's a better way. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they were deceived and want to do the right thing by the wife, they might not be wrong.\n"
