I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible For...) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author having a sexual relationship with a man who is married, thus cheating on his wife. The man is gay but hasn't come out yet, and the author is considering exposing the cheating to the wife while trying not to out him.\n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where they were deceived. The man was in a committed, legal marriage and had a family. The author didn't know about the marriage at the time of the affair, but now feels guilty and wants to do the right thing. The dilemma is whether to inform the wife about the infidelity, which would out the man as gay, potentially causing family issues with his parents who might not accept it.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is facing a tough choice. On one hand, the man is cheating, and the wife has a right to know. On the other hand, outing him could have severe consequences for him and his family. However, the author's actions also need to be considered. They were in a relationship with someone who was not available, which is ethically questionable. The author might be trying to mitigate their guilt by coming forward, but the situation is complex.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was in a non-consensual relationship (since the man was married), and now they want to expose the cheating. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The initial act of engaging in a relationship with a married man is problematic. However, the current dilemma is about exposing the cheating. The author is trying to balance the wife's rights with the man's privacy. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, cheating is a breach of trust, and the wife does have a right to know. However, the method of informing her is important. The author could potentially find a way to inform the wife without outing the man, but the user is unsure if that's possible. However, the author's initial decision to sleep with a married man is at fault. So, while the intention to inform the wife might be seen as trying to do the right thing, the author's role in the cheating complicates the matter.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is partially at fault for entering the relationship in the first place. However, their current dilemma is about making a difficult ethical choice. The question is whether they are in the wrong now. Since they're trying to right a wrong by informing the wife, but their initial action was wrong, it's a mix. But the primary question is whether they're in the wrong now. If we focus on the current situation, the author's intention to inform the wife is a proactive step, but the method (outing) could be problematic. However, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances. \n\nGiven that the author is trying to correct a wrong by informing the wife, but their initial involvement was unethical, the answer might lean towards them being in the wrong (A) because they were part of the cheating. However, others might argue that they're trying to do the right thing now. But the original question is whether they are in the wrong now, not whether they were in the past. The exposure of the cheater could be seen as a moral responsibility, even if it leads to outing him. However, the author's role in the affair complicates this. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions in the affair are wrong, but their current dilemma is about rectifying that. The key is whether exposing the cheater makes them right. Since they are trying to do the right thing, but their initial action was wrong, the answer might still be A (they are in the wrong) because their involvement in the affair is a separate issue. But the question is specifically about the current situation (exposing the cheater). If someone is trying to correct a mistake, perhaps they're not in the wrong now. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the act of cheating was their fault, so the answer might be A.\n"
