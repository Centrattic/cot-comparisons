  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user had a one-night stand with a married man who's also gay and in the closet. They kept meeting up multiple times, and now the user feels guilty because they're sleeping with someone who's cheating on his wife. The main question is whether the user is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: They had consensual relationships with someone who was married. The user didn't know he was married at the time, which complicates things. But after finding out, they feel bad and want to inform the wife. However, doing so would out him, which the user initially agreed not to do.\n\nMoral dilemmas here. The user is torn between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and informing the wife of the infidelity. The user's friend's family might not accept the man's sexuality, adding pressure. The user's intention is to do the right thing by the wife, but the method could harm the man.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? If they proceed to tell the wife, they're exposing the man's secret. But if they don't, the wife remains unaware of the cheating. Legally, the user isn't obligated to inform the wife. Ethically, it's a tough call. The user's actions in the relationship (sleeping with a married man) could be seen as contributing to the infidelity, but they had no prior knowledge of his marriage. \n\nSo, the user's dilemma is between two harms: outing someone versus letting a marriage continue in deceit. The user might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method of doing so without outing the man could be tricky. If the user is considering it, maybe they are trying to do the right thing, but the act of exposing the cheater by outing him might be problematic. However, the user's own actions (sleeping with the married man) could place them in a morally gray area. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the act of exposing the man's infidelity by outing his sexual orientation could have serious consequences. The user's own role in the affair might make them complicit, but their intention to right the wrong by informing the wife is understandable. So, the answer could be B (No, not in the wrong) because the user is trying to act in the wife's interest despite the personal risks to the man involved.\n"
