  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the user had a relationship with someone who was married and in the closet. They didn't know about his marriage when they started sleeping together. Now they found out and are conflicted between protecting his privacy and telling his wife. \n\nThe main ethical points here involve consent and privacy. The user was lied to because the person was hiding his sexuality and his marital status. The user didn't know he was married, which complicates things. The man is cheating, which is a betrayal to his wife and kids. The user is considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him as gay, but the man had asked for secrecy.\n\nOn one hand, the user has the right to feel violated and want to inform the wife about the cheating. On the other, outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially if the family isn't accepting. The user is in a moral dilemma between two harmful outcomes: outing him or letting the wife be deceived.\n\nThe user might argue they're not at fault because they were unaware of the marriage. But they did form a relationship with someone who was already in a committed marriage, which could be seen as their own mistake. However, the man's deception is also a factor. \n\nI think the key here is that the user was deceived initially. They had no way of knowing the man was married when they started the affair. The user is now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it means outing him. This shows a conflict between two ethical obligations. Since the user is trying to act in good faith, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the act of sleeping with someone who is married is ethically questionable, regardless of the man's orientation. However, the user's intention now is to correct the harm by informing the wife, which is a positive action. So, the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
