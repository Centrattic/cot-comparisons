I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having an affair with a married man who is also gay and closeted. The author is now conflicted about whether to expose the man's infidelity to his wife, which would also out him to his family.\n\nFirst, the author is in a moral dilemma. They had an affair with someone who was married, which is ethically questionable. However, the key point here is the author's intention to inform the wife about the infidelity. The man is cheating, which is a betrayal, and the wife has a right to know. But outing him as gay could cause family issues, especially if his parents are not accepting. \n\nThe author is torn between protecting the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, cheating is wrong, but the author might feel compelled to act because they've been cheated on before and understand the pain. However, the act of outing someone without their consent is also a violation of their privacy. \n\nBut considering that the author has evidence of cheating, which is a separate issue from the man's sexual orientation. The author's responsibility to the wife might take precedence here. However, the method of revealing the infidelity could be done without explicitly outing him, maybe through anonymous means. Yet, the scenario suggests that outing him might be unavoidable due to the circumstances. \n\nThe author's initial agreement to keep the man's secret was part of a mutual understanding. Breaking that trust could be seen as wrong, but the man was already in a harmful situation by being in a fraudulent marriage. The author's actions are driven by a desire to prevent further harm to the wife. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, cheating is a private matter, but when it's part of a marriage, it's a significant breach. The author's decision to inform the wife could be seen as morally justified to prevent her from being deceived. However, the method of doing so without causing unnecessary harm to the man's family is crucial. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They're involved in an affair, which isn't great, but their intention to inform the wife about the cheating is morally ambiguous. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the balance between protecting the wife and respecting the man's privacy. Given the context, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. However, considering the wife's right to know about the infidelity, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, even if it out the man as gay. The main issue is whether there's a way to do so without outing him, which the author is already considering. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are trying to address a serious ethical issue (cheating) while being mindful of the man's privacy and family situation.\n"
