  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is in a tough spot here. They had a relationship with someone they met at a wedding, who is a married man and also gay but in the closet. The user found out about his marriage and kids, and they're conflicted about whether to expose him to his wife, which would out him, or to stay quiet.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: they had a sexual relationship with a married man. The man was already in a committed relationship, which is cheating. The user might feel they're helping by exposing the infidelity, but they also made a promise not to out him. So there's a conflict between their promise and their moral obligation to the wife.\n\nThe user is considering telling the wife, which would mean outing him. But the man's parents are not accepting of homosexuality. The user might be worried about causing family issues. However, the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. The user is torn between loyalty to their friend (and not breaking a promise) and the wife's right to know.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, cheating is wrong, so the user is complicit in the man's infidelity. However, they were unaware he was married. The man was deceptive by keeping his marriage and his sexuality hidden. The user didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair. \n\nBut the user is now facing a dilemma: to expose the cheater, which would out him, or not. The user might feel they have an obligation to the wife as the wronged party. However, outing someone against their wishes is a violation of trust. There's no clear right answer here. The user's initial actions were wrong because they had a sexual relationship with a married man, which is a betrayal of the man's wife. However, the man is also at fault for his deception.\n\nSo, the user's position is complicated. They might not be entirely in the wrong because they were deceived, but they did engage in an affair. However, the main wrongdoer is the married man. The user's responsibility now is whether to expose him, which could lead to outing him and family issues, or not, which leaves the wife in the dark. \n\nThe correct answer here is whether the user is in the wrong. The user had a sexual relationship with a married man, which is cheating. So, they are partially at fault. However, they didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair. The man was deceptive. The user might not be entirely in the wrong but has a responsibility now. The question is whether they are in the wrong for considering exposing him. \n\nGiven the scenario, the user's initial actions were a mistake, but they are in a moral dilemma now. They are not entirely in the wrong because they were misled. The main wrongdoer is the married man. So, the answer would be B (No, they are not in the wrong), but with the caveat that they have a responsibility to consider the consequences of their actions.\n"
