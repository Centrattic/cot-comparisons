I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They had multiple encounters, and the man asked them not to reveal his sexuality. Now, the author is conflicted because they want to tell the wife about the cheating but don't want to out him. \n\nThe key points here are consent and potential harm. The author was in a romantic/sexual relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. So, the author did contribute to the cheating by engaging in a relationship. But the main dilemma is whether to expose him. \n\nThe man is cheating, which is morally wrong, but he's also in a closeted situation. The author is now considering informing the wife, which would out him. The question is about the author's moral standing here.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they're protecting the wife from being cheated on. However, outing someone without their consent can lead to significant personal and family consequences. The man might face rejection from his parents, and the author might be seen as a snitch. \n\nBut the author also had a consensual affair with a married man, which complicates their moral position. They might feel guilty and want to make amends by informing the wife. However, they have to weigh the harm between the cheating and the outing. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They were part of the cheating by participating. However, their intent now is to prevent further harm by informing the wife. But outing him without consent could be a bigger violation. The answer might hinge on whether the author has a duty to the wife or the man's privacy.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions are influenced by their own guilt and desire to correct a mistake. But they have to consider if they have the right to make that choice for him. Since he's in the closet, outing him without his consent could be a betrayal of trust, even if the reason is to report cheating. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but they might be in the wrong for violating the man's privacy. The question is whether their actions cross a line. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer isn't straightforward. However, since the author was part of the cheating, they might be in the wrong for initiating the affair. But their current dilemma is about the next step. The question is whether they're in the wrong now for considering exposure. If the answer is about the current action (exposing), maybe the author is not in the wrong because the cheating is harmful. But since it's a WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) scenario, the community might debate both sides. However, the author's own actions in the affair might make them an asshole regardless. \n\nBut the specific question is about the act of exposing. If they go ahead, they might be justified in protecting the wife, but at the cost of outing him. However, since the man is cheating, the author's exposure could be seen as the lesser evil. But the author's own role in the cheating complicates this. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the cheater violated the marriage, and the author is trying to correct that. However, the conflict arises from the closeted aspect. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing, it's a balance between protecting the wife and respecting the man's privacy. Given that the author didn't know about the marriage initially, but proceeded, their actions might be seen as contributing to the problem. However, the moral obligation to the wife could exonerate them. So, answer B.\n"
