I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for potentially exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The situation involves multiple factors.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with the married man who's cheating. They had multiple encounters not knowing he's married. Now they found out, and they're conflicted about whether to tell his wife, which would out him. The key points here are the ethics of exposing someone's infidelity versus outing their sexuality, especially when his family might not accept it.\n\nThe author was initially complicit by keeping the affair secret. Now, they want to inform the wife, which is understandable since the wife has a right to know about the cheating. However, by doing so, they would also reveal his sexuality, which he hasn't come out with. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nIf the author's intent is purely to inform the wife about the cheating, that's one thing. But since outing him is a consequence, there's a conflict. However, the author isn't the one cheating; they were deceived. The cheater is the one at fault for lying to both the author and his wife. The author's dilemma is between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. \n\nLegally, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. Ethically, though, outing someone's sexuality without consent is a violation of privacy. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they should consider if there's a way to do so without outing him. If the author can find a way to tell the wife without revealing his sexuality, that would be ideal. If not, then the act of outing him could be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent is good. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, but they need to be cautious about the method to avoid unnecessary harm to the man's privacy. The answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong, but they should proceed carefully to minimize collateral damage.\n"
