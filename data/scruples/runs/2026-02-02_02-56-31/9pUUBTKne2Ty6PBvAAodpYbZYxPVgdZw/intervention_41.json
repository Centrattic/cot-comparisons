  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The situation involves a friend's sister's wedding where they met an usher with whom they had a sexual relationship. The usher is married with two kids and in the closet. The user now wants to tell the wife but is conflicted about outing him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The user didn't know he was married and had kids when they started the relationship. They were respecting his privacy by not outing him until they found out about the cheating. The dilemma is whether to inform the wife (thereby outing him) or stay silent.\n\nFrom the perspective of right and wrong, the user is dealing with two conflicting moral issues: protecting someone's privacy (his being gay) versus preventing harm by exposing a cheater. There's no clear right or wrong answer here. However, the user is not the one who committed the infidelity; they were the one involved in the affair without knowing the full context. \n\nThe user might feel a duty to the wife because the husband cheated. But they also have a responsibility to not out someone without their consent. The question is about whether the user is in the wrong for acting on this. \n\nPotential arguments for \"A\" (Yes, in the wrong): The user is complicit in the affair. Even if they didn't know initially, continuing after the first time might be considered enabling the cheating. Also, outing someone, even to prevent harm, could be seen as violating their privacy. The user's actions (sleeping with him multiple times) could be seen as wrong, as they had a relationship with someone already in a committed marriage.\n\nArguments for \"B\" (No, not in the wrong): The user was deceived. They didn't know he was married and tried to respect his privacy. The man is the one who cheated, so the user isn't the one at fault. The user is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even if it means outing him, which could be a necessary sacrifice to prevent further harm. Also, the user might not have the right to make that decision for him.\n\nI think the answer leans towards \"B\" because the user isn't the one who cheated; they were involved in a relationship that was based on a lie. The user is trying to inform the wife, which is a moral act to prevent ongoing harm, even though it involves outing. However, there's a nuance here. The user didn't know about the marriage when they started sleeping with him. So they weren't intentionally cheating. The main issue is whether the user should expose the cheater, which is usually the wife's right. But the user's role is complicated by the fact that they were involved in the affair. \n\nBut the question is about whether the user is in the wrong for considering the exposure. The user isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the husband did. The user was taken advantage of. So, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to tell the wife. However, the act of outing someone is a serious matter. The user might not have the right to make that choice for him. So if they chose to tell the wife, that could be seen as going beyond their role. But the dilemma is about whether they are in the wrong for that consideration. \n\nThe best answer here is \"B\" (No), but with the caveat that the user's actions in the affair might be seen as wrong, but the question is about whether they are in the wrong for exposing the cheater, which is a different matter. The user is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it's a difficult decision. They might not be in the wrong for that, but the situation is complex.\n"
