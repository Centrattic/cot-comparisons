  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is complicated because the man is married, cheating, and closeted. The person slept with him multiple times without knowing he was married.\n\nFirst, the person might feel conflicted because they were told not to reveal his sexuality. But the man is cheating, which is wrong. The person is now considering telling the wife, which would out him. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, the person had consensual relationships without knowing the man was married. They might not be at fault for the cheating itself, but they could be in the wrong for not checking his relationship status before getting involved. However, the man was hiding his marriage and sexuality, so part of the problem is his deception.\n\nIf the person tells the wife, they're exposing the man's infidelity and sexuality. The man might be at fault for cheating and lying, but the person could also be seen as violating his trust by outing him. However, the wife has a right to know about the cheating. But outing someone without their consent is a big deal, especially if it affects his family and safety.\n\nThere's a balance between the right to privacy and the right to know. The person might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but they might be in the wrong for outing the man. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to inform the wife without disclosing his sexuality, but the question is if that's possible. If the only way to inform the wife is by outing him, then there's a conflict.\n\nAlso, the person's own actions\u2014sleeping with a married man\u2014could be seen as wrong, but since they didn't know he was married, maybe that's different. The moral dilemma is whether the duty to inform the wife outweighs the duty to protect his privacy.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the person's actions in telling the wife might be seen as necessary to prevent harm, but it's also respecting the man's privacy. The answer might depend on the ethical framework used. If the person is in the wrong, it's possibly because they're violating the man's trust. If not, it's because they're trying to stop the cheating. But this is tricky. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I think the answer is B (No), because the person is trying to correct the wrong done by the cheater, even though it's a tough call. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is if they're in the wrong, so the answer might be B.\n"
