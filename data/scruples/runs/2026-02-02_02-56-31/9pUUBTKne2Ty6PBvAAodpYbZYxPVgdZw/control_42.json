I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having an affair with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. The man is cheating on his wife, and the author is conflicted about whether to expose him, which would out him as gay, potentially causing family issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a relationship with someone who was already married, which is cheating. The man asked the author not to tell anyone because he's in the closet. The author is now considering telling the wife, which would out him. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the author's actions: they had multiple affairs knowing the man was married. That's definitely cheating. But the author claims they didn't know he was married at first. Wait, the man was an usher at the author's best friend's sister's wedding. The author's friend's sister is married to someone else. Wait, the author is friends with the best friend's family for 15 years. So when the sister got married, the author attended. The usher is the sister's husband's brother? Wait, no, the sister got married, so the usher is someone else. Then the author slept with the usher, who is married to someone else (the wife was out of the country). So the author had a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. The author didn't know he was married initially? Wait, no. Wait, the author is saying that they didn't know he was married until later. Wait, the man is the sister's husband's brother? No, the usher is someone else. Let me read again.\n\nThe author's best friend's sister got married. The author attended the wedding. The usher was someone they met there. The author had sex with the usher. The next day, the usher told the author he's gay and in the closet. Later, the author finds out that the usher is married with two kids. So the author didn't know he was married when they started the affair. Wait, but he was an usher at the wedding. The sister's wedding, so the usher is another person. The author didn't know that the usher was married. So the author had an affair with someone who was married, not knowing at the time. But then the author found out later that he's married. So the author continued the affair after finding out? Wait, the author says they hooked up five more times after the wedding. So after knowing he was married, they kept having sex. That's cheating. So the author is in a relationship with someone who is married, and they knew it after the first time. Therefore, the author is complicit in the cheating. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him as gay. But the original question is whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe main issue here is the author's own actions. The author had an affair with someone who was married, which is cheating. Even if the man was the one who initiated it, the author participated. The author is now considering exposing the man to his wife, which would out him as gay. But the author's own actions are part of the problem. So, the author is in the wrong for engaging in an affair with a married man. However, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong in the entire situation, including the possible exposure. \n\nBut the user's main question is about the exposure part. The original post is asking if exposing the cheater (thus outing him) would make the author a terrible person. The user is seeking advice on that. But the current question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, are they in the wrong for having the affair and considering exposure?\n\nThe author is wrong for having an affair with a married person. That's cheating. The author is also considering exposing someone, which could be seen as a moral dilemma. But the initial act of cheating is definitely wrong. So, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they engaged in an affair. However, the user might be focusing more on the exposure part. But according to the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the entire situation. Since the author had an affair, they are at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
