  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a complicated situation where they're considering exposing someone who's cheating. The key points here are the ethical dilemma between outing a closeted gay man and preventing his wife from continuing a betrayed marriage.\n\nFirst, the user had a consensual relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They were told not to reveal his sexuality, and they agreed. Now, they found out he's cheating on his wife, which is causing moral conflict. The user is wondering if they're wrong for considering exposing him, which would out him to his wife, family, and possibly others.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, cheating isn't illegal, but the user might feel a duty to inform the wife. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent can have serious consequences, especially in families that are not accepting. The user's friend's family might react poorly, leading to emotional or familial harm. \n\nEthically, there's a conflict between the right to privacy and the right to know. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity, but outing the husband's sexuality could violate his privacy. The user might not be at fault for the initial relationship, as it was consensual, but they are now in a position where their next action could affect multiple people. \n\nPossible alternatives: The user could anonymously inform the wife about the cheating without mentioning his sexuality. That way, the wife knows about the infidelity, and the husband's privacy is respected. However, the user isn't sure if the wife is aware of his sexuality, which complicates things. If the wife isn't in the closet about his being gay, then informing her might still out him. \n\nThe user's main dilemma is balancing the wife's right to know about the cheating versus the husband's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The user isn't in the wrong for feeling conflicted, but the final decision hinges on whether the act of informing the wife necessarily out the husband. If it does, then the user has to weigh the consequences of outing him versus allowing the wife to stay unaware. If there's a way to inform the wife without outing him (e.g., just stating the cheating without mentioning his sexuality), then that might be the ethical path. However, if the cheating is tied to his sexuality (as implied by the Grindr account), then anonymity might not be possible. \n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for considering this, but the action they take should prioritize the least harmful option. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer is B (No, they are not in the wrong) because they're caught in a complex situation where they're trying to balance conflicting moral obligations.\n"
