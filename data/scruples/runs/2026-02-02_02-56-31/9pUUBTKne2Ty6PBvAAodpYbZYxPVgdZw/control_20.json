I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 20-year-old man who had a series of relationships with a married man who is in the closet. The key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, even if it out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author is in a dilemma between protecting someone's privacy (the usher's sexual orientation) and informing the wife about the infidelity. The usher is married, cheating, and hiding his sexuality. The author is conflicted because outing someone can be harmful, especially if the person's family is not accepting. But the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, cheating isn't illegal, and the author isn't a party to the marriage. So legally, he's not obligated to inform the wife. Ethically, though, there's a debate. Some might argue that the author has a duty to warn the wife, as she's been wronged. Others might say it's not his place to interfere, especially since he's part of the affair, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's actions: He had a consensual relationship (though it's cheating by the usher), and now he's considering exposing the usher. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so. If he tells the wife, he's outing the usher, which could have serious consequences for him. However, the usher is the one who cheated, so the author's role is as a third party. \n\nThe author might be seen as partly complicit because he was involved in the affair. But the primary wrongdoer is the usher. The author's dilemma is whether to prioritize the usher's privacy or the wife's right to know. The author isn't the one who committed the infidelity, so his moral responsibility is less clear. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the cheater; he's a participant in the affair. If he decides to inform the wife, he's choosing between two harmful outcomes. However, he's not in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing by the wife, even if it means outing the usher. But if he's part of the cheating, he might share some guilt. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author is not the one who committed the betrayal. The usher is the one who cheated. The author's decision to expose the usher is a moral choice between privacy and honesty. Since the author isn't the one who caused the marriage harm, he's not in the wrong for seeking to inform the wife, even if it out the usher. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
