  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation involves a married man who's having an affair with the user, who's also in a closeted relationship. The user is conflicted between protecting his privacy and informing his wife.\n\nFirst, the user had a consensual relationship with the man, who was married. The user didn't know about his marriage initially and later found out. The man is in the closet, so outing him could have serious repercussions on his family. The user is considering telling the wife, which would out him, but they're conflicted about that.\n\nLegally, the user isn't breaking any laws by having consensual relationships, even if it's with someone who's married. However, there's an ethical dilemma here. The user is now caught between two wrongs: either staying silent and allowing the ongoing cheating, or exposing him and outing him against his wishes. \n\nThe user's main issue is whether they have an obligation to inform the wife. From a moral standpoint, some might argue that the wife deserves to know about the infidelity. But the user also promised not to out the man, which adds another layer. \n\nThere's a question of whether the user is being honest with themselves about their role in the situation. They were aware he was in a relationship (though not married) at the start, so there's a level of complicity. However, they were misled about his marital status. \n\nIf the user decides to tell the wife, they might be doing the right thing for the wife but violating the man's trust. On the other hand, staying silent could be seen as enabling the cheating. \n\nThe answer likely hinges on the consequences of each action. Outing someone without consent can be harmful, but so can allowing a spouse to be cheated on. Since the user is in a moral dilemma, it's a tough spot, but the initial action of sleeping with a married man (even if unknowingly at first) could be seen as contributing to the problem. However, the user isn't the one who broke the trust in the marriage; the married man did. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong for being in the situation, but the decision to expose him is complex. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the user's actions were consensual and in the context of being misled. However, the choice to inform the wife involves weighing different ethical considerations.\n"
