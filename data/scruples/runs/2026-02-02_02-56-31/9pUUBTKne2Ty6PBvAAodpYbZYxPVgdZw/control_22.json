I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a one-night stand with an usher at a wedding, and later found out he's married with kids. The author is now considering exposing him as a cheater, which would also out him as gay since he's in the closet.\n\nFirst, the author was involved in a relationship with someone who's already married. That's cheating, right? So they were unfaithful to their own partner if they're in a relationship. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong in the context of deciding to expose the cheater. \n\nThe usher is the one who cheated, not the author. Wait, the author is the one who had sex with a married man. So technically, the author is also cheating on their own partner if they're in one. But the original question is more about the author's responsibility to expose the usher's infidelity. \n\nThe author is now conflicted between exposing the usher (which would reveal his sexuality) and keeping it secret. The main issue here is whether the author has a duty to inform the wife, even if it out her husband. \n\nSo, the author's actions in terms of the exposure: if they tell the wife, they're helping her discover the infidelity, which is a valid concern. But outing the usher as gay could have serious repercussions for him and his family. The author's initial involvement was a mistake, but now they're trying to make amends by confronting the wrongdoer. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for considering telling the wife? Well, the usher was deceptive, hiding his marital status and sexuality. The author didn't know he was married, so maybe they were also misled. But they had multiple encounters after knowing he was an usher (though not knowing he was married). \n\nIf the author is not in a relationship, then their own actions aren't cheating. But if they are in a relationship, then they were unfaithful. However, the main question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. \n\nThe key here is whether the author has an obligation to report the cheater's actions. Since the author was also part of the affair, they might be complicit. But the wife has a right to know if her husband is cheating. \n\nBut exposing the cheater would involve outing him as gay, which he's not ready for. The author has to weigh the right of the wife to know about the infidelity against the usher's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. \n\nIn some cases, people argue that the wife deserves to know, especially if there's a child involved. But the usher is the one who broke the vows, not the author. The author's dilemma is about whether they should be the one to inform the wife, even if it out the usher. \n\nThe author's own actions (sleeping with the married usher) are problematic, but the question is about the wrongness of exposing the cheater. If the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, that might not be wrong, but it's a complex situation. \n\nHowever, the author could be in the wrong if they're violating the usher's privacy by outing him, even for a good cause. But the usher is the one who was unfaithful. The author's friend's family might be affected too, as the usher is part of their family. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They were involved in an affair and now want to help the wife. But their actions might cause harm to the usher and his family. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, but the situation is ethically complicated. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial act of sleeping with a married person is wrong, but the question is about the current decision. The author is considering exposing the cheater, which isn't their affair. The wife has the right to know, but the author might not have the right to out the usher. \n\nSo, if the author tells the wife, it's not necessarily their wrong, but it's a choice with consequences. The answer options are A for yes, the author is in the wrong, and B for no. \n\nHmm. The original act (sleeping with a married man) is a mistake, but the question is about the current dilemma. The author isn't the one who's cheating now; they're trying to address the issue. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. They are in a difficult position where they have to decide between two harmful actions, but the act of informing the wife isn't inherently wrong. However, the initial infidelity might be a point to consider. But the question is specifically about the exposure part. So the answer is B.\n"
