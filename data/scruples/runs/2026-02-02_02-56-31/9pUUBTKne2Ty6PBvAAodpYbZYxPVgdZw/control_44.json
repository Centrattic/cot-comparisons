I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by summarizing the scenario.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old man who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old man named \"my best friend's sister's husband.\" The husband is married, has two kids, and is in the closet. The author found out the husband is married and cheating. The author is conflicted because he doesn't want to out the man but feels the wife has a right to know. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong if he tells the wife, which would out the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author had consensual relationships with the married man, who was cheating on his wife. The author didn't know about the marriage initially. Now, he's trying to decide whether to inform the wife, even though it would out the husband as gay. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. On one hand, cheating is generally considered wrong, and the wife has a right to know about infidelity. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially if the person is in the closet and their family might not accept their sexuality. The author might be seen as violating the husband's privacy if he out him, even with good intentions.\n\nBut here's the catch: the author was part of the cheating by having a sexual relationship with the husband. So, is the author in the wrong for being involved in an affair, or is the main issue about whether he should expose the husband? The user's question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater (the husband) by telling the wife, which would out him.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, he's reporting infidelity, which is a valid concern, but the method involves outing the husband. However, the author's involvement in the affair complicates things. By being part of the cheating, the author might have a responsibility to inform the wife, but he might also be seen as a participant in the wrongdoing. However, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, not necessarily for being in the affair. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. The answer hinges on whether the act of informing the wife (thereby outing the husband) is ethically wrong. Since the author was having an affair, he's part of the problem. However, the act of informing the wife could be seen as a moral duty to prevent further betrayal. But the act of outing the husband without his consent is another issue. The author might be in a conflict between two wrongs: not wanting to out the husband and wanting to protect the wife.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to expose the cheater (husband) by informing the wife, even if it out him. If the author's intent is to do the right thing by the wife, then maybe he isn't in the wrong. However, if outing the husband without consent is considered a violation of his rights, then the author is in the wrong. But the husband is the one who cheated, so the author is trying to inform the wronged party. It's a complex situation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for being part of the affair in the first place. But the user's question is specifically about exposing the cheater, not the initial decision to be in the affair. So the focus is on the exposure part. \n\nIn this case, the author is trying to balance two ethical issues: the right of the wife to know about the infidelity and the privacy of the husband's sexuality. The author is caught in the middle. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the ethical framework. If the priority is the wife's right to know, then he's not in the wrong. If respecting the husband's privacy is more important, then he is in the wrong. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. Given that the author's intention is to inform the wife about the infidelity, which is a legitimate concern, but the method involves outing the husband without consent, which is a privacy issue. However, the husband is the one who is cheating, so the author's action might be justified. But since the author was part of the affair, it's possible that he's considered complicit, which might make his decision to inform the wife less clear-cut. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be trying to mitigate his own guilt by taking action, but that doesn't necessarily make him right. The key is whether informing the wife is ethically correct despite the consequences for the husband. Since the author's actions led to the wife being cheated on, he might have a duty to correct that. But outing the husband without his consent could be seen as violating his rights, even if the husband is guilty of cheating. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. However, in terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. The answer likely depends on whether the exposure (outing) is justified by the need to inform the wife. If the author can find a way to inform the wife without outing the husband (e.g., anonymously), that would be better. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for doing it, which involves outing. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a difficult situation. His actions of being part of the affair are problematic, but the question is about exposing the cheater. Since the author's intent is to protect the wife, he might not be in the wrong, but the act of outing the husband without consent complicates it. However, since the husband is the one who cheated, the author's action might be seen as necessary, even if it out him. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but there are nuances.\n"
