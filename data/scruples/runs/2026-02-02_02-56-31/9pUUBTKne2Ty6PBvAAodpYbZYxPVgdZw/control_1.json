I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old who had a relationship with a man (23 years old) who's married and has kids. The man is gay but in the closet. They met at a wedding, slept together multiple times. The author didn't know he was married and only found out later. Now, the author is conflicted between exposing the cheating husband, which would out him as gay, or keeping quiet to avoid causing family issues.\n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where they were deceived. The man was married and had a secret life, which is cheating. The author didn't know this when they started the relationship. The man also asked them to keep his sexuality a secret. Now that the author knows, they want to tell the wife but don't want to out him as gay.\n\nThe key points here: the author is considering exposing the husband's infidelity, which would out him as gay. The author is trying to balance the wife's right to know with the husband's privacy and family dynamics. The author's actions were based on misinformation, so they might feel guilt. But is the author in the wrong?\n\nThe author is not the one who cheated. The man is the one who was unfaithful and hid his marriage. The author's mistake was not knowing the man was married. The author might be trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, but it's complicated because it involves outing someone. However, the author is in a dilemma here, not the one who caused harm. The man is responsible for his actions, not the author. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even though there are ethical challenges. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
