I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sexual relationship with a married man who is also in the closet about being gay. The author is conflicted about whether to expose the cheating, which would out him, or stay silent.\n\nFirst, the author was in a consensual relationship with someone who was married and not out as gay. The man was married with children, and the author had multiple encounters with him after knowing he was married. That seems like cheating from the husband's side. But the author didn't know he was married initially? Wait, no, the author found out a week ago that he was married. Wait, wait, the timeline is important here. The author met the man at the wedding, which was the sister's wedding. Then they started hooking up after that. The author didn't know he was married until a week ago. So the author had multiple encounters without knowing he was married. Then found out later. So the author is in a relationship with a married man without knowing he was married. But then, after finding out, is considering exposing the cheating to the wife, which would out him as gay.\n\nSo the key points are: the author had consensual relationships with a married man (who's cheating on his wife), the man is closeted, and the author is now considering informing the wife about the cheating, which would involve outing him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might be in the wrong because they were involved in a relationship without knowing the man was married. But the man was the one who was cheating. However, the author continued the relationship after finding out? Wait, no. Wait, the author found out a week ago, so they had five more encounters? Wait, the user says \"we became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding.\" So after the wedding, they had five more hookups. Then a week ago, the author found out he was married. Wait, the timeline is a bit confusing. Let me parse the original post again.\n\nThe user says: \"At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers... slept together. He asked me the next day not to tell anyone... I told him sure... became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. All of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married...\" So the author started the relationship not knowing he was married, had five more times after the wedding, and then found out a week ago (presumably after those five times). Wait, that can't be. If the author found out a week ago, and the five hookups happened after the wedding, then the author was having five hookups before finding out. So the author had multiple encounters with a man who was secretly married and cheating. Then, upon finding out, the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him as gay.\n\nSo the author's actions up to finding out: they had a sexual relationship with someone who was in a married, presumably heterosexual relationship, without the author's knowledge. The author might not be at fault for not knowing, but they continued the relationship knowing the man was closeted. However, the man was the one who was cheating. The author's dilemma is whether to expose the cheating, which would out him as gay, causing family issues, or stay silent.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't know he was married when they started the relationship. So they weren't intentionally cheating with someone else's spouse. However, the author did continue the relationship after knowing the man was closeted but not married, and later found out he was married. The author's actions after finding out are the key here. The user is asking if exposing the cheater (thus outing him) would be wrong.\n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but ethically, the author is in a tough spot. The man is the one who was unfaithful, but he's also in the closet. The author's responsibility to the wife versus the man's privacy. The author's actions in continuing the relationship after knowing the man was married could be seen as complicit in the cheating. However, the author didn't know at the time. The author's decision to inform the wife would be a moral choice, but it's a dilemma. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being in the situation. Since the author didn't know initially, and later found out, but continued the relationship, maybe they are partially at fault for not stopping when they knew he was closeted. But the main issue is whether they are in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater by outing him. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the author is in the wrong for the actions described. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for the situation as a whole. The author's actions of having a relationship with someone who was married without knowing could be seen as not their fault, but the fact that they continued after finding out he was married (and then he's cheating) is more complex. However, according to the timeline, the author found out he was married a week ago, after the five hookups. Wait, the user says \"All of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married...\" So the five hookups happened before the week ago finding out. So the author had five hookups before knowing he was married, then found out a week later. Then, after finding out, they confronted him. So the author's actions up to the point of finding out were done without knowledge of the marriage. The author is now at a crossroads about whether to inform the wife. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the initial relationship. Since the author didn't know he was married, they aren't at fault for that. However, the author is now considering exposing the cheater, which would out him. But the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong in the situation. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions (the relationship with someone who was secretly married and closeted) are morally wrong. \n\nIn terms of moral wrongdoing, the author's actions of entering into a relationship without knowing the man was married is not their fault. However, if they had known, they wouldn't have continued. The man was the one who was unfaithful. So the primary wrongdoing is on the married man. The author's dilemma is about whether to expose him, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being in the situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
