  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that they had a relationship with someone who's married, and they found out the person is married with kids. The person is also gay and in the closet. The question is whether the narrator is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The narrator had consensual relationships with the married man, who is hiding his sexuality and cheating on his wife. The narrator didn't know he was married initially and later found out. They are conflicted between wanting to tell the wife (which would out him) and respecting his privacy.\n\nSo, am I in the wrong? Let's break it down. The narrator didn't know he was married, so the affair wasn't necessarily consensual on the wife's side. Cheating is generally considered wrong, but the man is in a difficult position because he's closeted. The narrator is now facing the moral dilemma of whether to expose him to the wife, which would out him, possibly causing family issues, or to stay silent and let the wife be unaware of the infidelity.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, cheating isn't illegal, so the narrator isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, however, it's more complex. The narrator is in a position where they know about the infidelity and the man's sexuality. By not telling the wife, the narrator might be enabling the cheating, but by telling the wife, they might out someone who isn't ready.\n\nBut the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. If they choose to tell the wife, they're breaching the man's confidentiality, which could be seen as invasive. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The man's choice to be in the closet while cheating complicates things. The narrator's initial agreement to keep the affair secret adds another layer\u2014maybe they should have respected that, but they were unaware of the marriage.\n\nThe key here is whether the narrator's actions (considering both the affair and the potential exposure) make them wrong. Since they were unaware of the man's marriage at first, the affair might not be entirely their fault. But after finding out, they have a duty to consider both parties. However, the decision to expose him could be seen as meddling, but it's also about honesty in a relationship. The man's deception is significant, so the narrator might feel conflicted but not entirely at fault.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (No, they're not in the wrong) because they're caught in a situation where both choices have ethical implications. The mistake was the affair, but the dilemma is about what to do next. The person isn't being asked to take responsibility for the cheater's actions, but rather whether their decision to expose is wrong. Since they're in a moral quandary, maybe they aren't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it out the man. So the answer would be B.\n"
