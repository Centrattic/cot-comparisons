  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person had a relationship with someone who's married, has kids, and is in the closet. They were told not to tell anyone because he's not ready to come out. Now, the user found out he's cheating and wants to tell his wife but is conflicted about outing him.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the user is in the wrong. The user is trying to balance honesty and protecting someone's privacy. On one hand, cheating is a serious betrayal, and the wife has a right to know. On the other hand, outing someone against their wishes can have severe consequences, especially if the person's family is not accepting.\n\nThe user's dilemma is between two ethical issues: the right of the wife to know about the infidelity and the right of the husband to privacy regarding his sexuality. The user didn't know about the marriage or the husband's orientation when they started the relationship, which complicates things. They genuinely feel bad about the situation because they've been cheated on before and empathize with the wife.\n\nNow, considering the options. If the user tells the wife, they might be doing the right thing by informing her about the cheating, but it out the husband. However, if they don't tell, they're letting a marriage be affected by infidelity without the wife's knowledge. But how to tell without outing him? Maybe there's a way to inform the wife discreetly without revealing the husband's sexuality. But if the user is the one who slept with the husband, it's hard to do without implicating themselves and outing him.\n\nThe user's actions so far: They were asked to keep the affair secret, and they agreed. Now, they're in a position where they feel morally conflicted. The user might be in the right for trying to do the right thing by considering telling the wife, but also in the wrong for having an affair with a married man who was in the closet. However, the user wasn't aware of the marriage when the affair started, which complicates their responsibility.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between loyalty to the friend's family and the wife's right to know. The user might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the husband's privacy but also wanting to prevent further harm to the wife. However, the act of having an affair with a married man (even if he's closeted) could be seen as wrong, but the user's intention to expose the cheating could be seen as trying to make amends.\n\nI think the answer here is B (I am not in the wrong) because the user is trying to navigate a complex situation where both sides have valid claims. They're not malicious; they're trying to do the right thing but caught between two difficult choices. The fact that they care about the husband's well-being and the wife's right shows they're not acting out of malice. However, the act of having an affair might make part of them responsible, but the question is about being in the wrong overall. Since they're trying to correct their mistake by considering informing the wife, their intentions are noble, so the answer is B.\n"
