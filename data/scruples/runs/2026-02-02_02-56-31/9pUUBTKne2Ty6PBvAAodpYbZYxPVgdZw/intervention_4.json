  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user had a relationship with someone who's married and in the closet. The person asked them not to reveal his sexuality. Now the user is conflicted between protecting his privacy and informing his wife about the cheating.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the confidentiality the person asked for and the ethical obligation to inform the wife. On one hand, outing someone without their consent can be a violation of their privacy, especially if they're not ready. The user respects that and even mentions not wanting to cause family issues. On the other hand, the wife has the right to know about the infidelity, but revealing the husband's sexuality might be necessary to do that.\n\nWait, but can the user inform the wife without outing him? If the user knows the husband is cheating through another means, maybe they don't need to mention his sexuality. But if the only way to inform the wife is by revealing his extramarital affair, which involves the user, then it's a dilemma between two harms. The user might have to choose between breaching confidentiality or enabling ongoing cheating.\n\nBut in this case, the user is the one who had the affair. They might be complicit in the cheating. So maybe they do have a responsibility to inform the wife. However, is outing him the right way to do that? The user is in a tough spot. They didn't know he was married when they started the relationship, but now they know. The user might feel guilty and wants to do the right thing, but the methods are conflicting.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. If they choose to expose the cheater, even if it out him, are they acting wrongly? Or is it justified? Legally, maybe not, but ethically? It's a gray area. The user is trying to make the wife aware, which is a moral obligation, but the means involve outing someone. Depending on the culture and the husband's family, outing could be harmful. However, the wife's right to know her spouse's infidelity is also important.\n\nIn this case, the user might be in the right because they're trying to expose a betrayal, but the method could be problematic. So the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong), but with the caveat that they should consider the consequences and find a way to inform the wife without breaching the husband's privacy if possible. If not, then it's a tough call but perhaps not the user's fault for trying to do the right thing.\n"
