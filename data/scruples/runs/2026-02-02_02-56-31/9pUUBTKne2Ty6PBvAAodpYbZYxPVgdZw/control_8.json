I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking whether they would be in the wrong for exposing a cheating husband, even if it means outing him as gay. The situation involves a complex moral dilemma.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with a married man who is in the closet. They became close, and the man is struggling with his sexuality and his marriage. The key points here are the author's actions in the affair and their current dilemma about exposing the cheating.\n\nInitially, the author was complicit in the cheating by engaging in a relationship with the married man. That's a problem because the man was in a committed marriage. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong now for considering exposing the infidelity to the wife, even if it out him as gay.\n\nMoral responsibility here might involve several angles. The author's own actions in the affair were wrong because they were part of a cheating scenario. But the current question is about their next step. If they expose the cheating, they could help the wife by informing her of the betrayal, which is a valid concern. However, outing the man as gay without his consent could be a violation of his privacy, especially if he's not ready to come out. The author has to weigh the wife's right to know against the husband's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the family dynamics. The man's parents might not accept his sexuality, so outing him could cause family conflict. The author's intention is to do the right thing by the wife but without causing unnecessary harm to the man. The dilemma is whether the moral duty to the wife outweighs the duty to protect the man's privacy.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, there's a principle of non-maleficence (do no harm) and also the principle of autonomy (respecting individuals' rights to make their own decisions). The author might be trying to prevent further harm to the wife by informing her, but they also have to consider the man's autonomy and his choice to remain closeted.\n\nHowever, the initial action of having an affair with a married person was wrong, regardless of the man's sexual orientation. But the current question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheating. The act of reporting the infidelity to the wife is a different ethical consideration. The author's main responsibility here is to decide if they have a duty to the wife. If the wife has a right to know about the cheating, then the author's intention to expose the infidelity could be seen as morally right, even if it means outing him. But if the author can expose the cheating without revealing his sexuality, that might be the preferable path. \n\nHowever, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The initial affair was wrong, but the act of exposing the cheating, if done truthfully and with the wife's best interest in mind, might not be wrong. The author's moral dilemma is valid because they are trying to balance conflicting duties. However, the author's own participation in the affair complicates their position. They might be seen as having contributed to the problem, so their decision to expose the cheating could be seen as an attempt to mitigate their own guilt or to help the wife. \n\nIn summary, the author's initial actions were wrong, but their current dilemma is about whether to expose the cheating. The answer hinges on whether the author is obligated to inform the wife. If the author decides not to expose the cheating, they might be in the wrong for allowing the cheating to continue. If they do expose it and cause the man to be outed, they might be in the right if it's for the wife's benefit. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the complexity, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong for considering exposing the cheating to the wife, as they are trying to do the right thing despite the difficult consequences.\n"
