  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the user had a sexual relationship with someone who was married and in the closet. The man asked them not to reveal anything, and the user respected his privacy initially. Then they found out he's cheating on his wife. Now they're conflicted between exposing him (which would out him as gay) and keeping quiet to protect him from family issues.\n\nThe user is concerned about their own morality here. They were in a relationship with the man, so they might feel responsible for his actions. But they also care about him and his family. The key points here are consent, deception by the man, and the user's responsibility to the wife.\n\nLegally, adultery isn't a crime in most places, so the user isn't doing anything illegal by sleeping with someone married. However, the user is considering exposing the man's infidelity and his sexuality without his consent. That brings up ethical issues about privacy and consent. The man was in the closet and trusted the user not to out him, which the user honored until now.\n\nThe user's dilemma is whether to prioritize the wife's right to know about the infidelity or the man's privacy and safety regarding his sexuality. If the user tells the wife, they might be outing the man, which could have severe personal and family consequences for him. However, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? They acted on the man's request to keep his sexuality private, which was a commitment. Now, breaking that trust could be seen as a violation. But the user might argue that the wife has a right to know. However, the user isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the man did. The user's actions were consensual, even if they were with a married person. So, the user isn't wrong for being in a relationship with someone who was married, but they are now at a crossroads about exposing the man's actions.\n\nEthically, it's complex. The user wants to do the right thing but is torn between two wrongs. The answer might hinge on whether the user is obligated to expose the infidelity. Since they weren't the one who cheated, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, they might feel morally conflicted. So, the answer would likely be B (No, they aren't in the wrong) because they acted on the man's trust and are now trying to resolve the conflict between two parties without being the cheater themselves.\n"
