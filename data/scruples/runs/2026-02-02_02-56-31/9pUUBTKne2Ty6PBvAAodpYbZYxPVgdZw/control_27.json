I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 20-year-old male, had a sexual relationship with a married man who's in the closet. The man, who is 23, was an usher at the author's best friend's sister's wedding. They started sleeping together after a party, and the author didn't know the man was married with kids. After finding out, the author is torn between exposing the cheater (which would out him) and not wanting to out him.\n\nFirst, the author is questioning if they're in the wrong for considering exposing this. Let's break it down. The man is cheating on his wife, which is a serious issue. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, the man is also in the closet, so revealing his affair would mean outing him as gay, which could cause family issues, especially with his parents who might not be accepting.\n\nThe author has a moral dilemma. On one hand, they want to protect the man's privacy and avoid family conflict. On the other, the wife deserves to know about the betrayal. The author is asking if they'd be in the wrong for telling the wife, even if it out the husband.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they had a consensual relationship with the man before knowing he was married. Once they found out, they confronted him, and he admitted he wants to leave but can't due to the kids. The author feels guilty because they know what cheating feels like from their own experience.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were initially deceived because the man was in the closet. The author didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair. So the author isn't necessarily at fault for the initial relationship, as they weren't aware. However, continuing the relationship after finding out the man is married would be problematic. But the author stopped and is now trying to decide whether to expose the cheater.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author is obligated to inform the wife. The author might not be legally or morally bound to do so, but they feel a sense of obligation. However, outing the man without his consent could be a violation of his privacy, even if it's to inform his wife. The author is caught between two wrongs: not telling the wife versus outing the man.\n\nIs there a way to inform the wife without outing the man? Maybe, but it's tricky. The wife might need to know about the infidelity, but the method of informing her could impact the man's privacy. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but they could be in the wrong for outing someone else's spouse without considering the consequences.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, but the act of outing him could be problematic. However, the answer should be based on whether the author is in the wrong. Since the initial relationship was consensual and they were deceived, and the author is trying to resolve the situation morally, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The author is a third party who wasn't directly involved in the marriage, so they might not have a duty to inform the wife. However, they might feel morally responsible. The main question is whether the author is wrong for considering taking action. Since the author is conflicted and trying to do the right thing, maybe the answer is B. Alternatively, if the author proceeds to expose the man without considering all angles, maybe they are wrong. But the question is whether they are in the wrong now, given the situation. The answer is B.\n"
