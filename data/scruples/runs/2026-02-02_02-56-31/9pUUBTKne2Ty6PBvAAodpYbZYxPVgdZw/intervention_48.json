  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. They had an affair with a married man who's in the closet. The dilemma is between protecting him from being outed versus informing his wife about the infidelity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The user had a relationship with someone who's married, which is cheating. They knew he was in the closet and promised not to out him. Now they found out he's married with kids and feel guilty. They want to tell his wife but don't want to out him, especially since his family might not accept his sexuality.\n\nSo, am the user in the wrong? Well, they were in a consensual relationship with a married man. Cheating is morally wrong in many contexts, so their initial actions were unethical. But the main question is about the current dilemma: exposing the cheater by informing his wife, which would out him.\n\nIf they tell the wife, they're breaking their promise not to out him. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, the user isn't in a position to act as a moral authority here. They were complicit in the cheating. They might feel guilty, but exposing him could cause family issues and trauma. Also, they're not certain if they're the only one; he has a Grindr account, so there might be others involved.\n\nIs there a way to inform the wife without outing him? Maybe, but it's tricky. If they contact the wife anonymously, but there's a risk of being discovered. Also, the user's motives might be mixed with guilt and wanting to do the right thing, but their actions could lead to unintended consequences for the man's family.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user's initial actions (cheating) were wrong, but the main question is about their current dilemma. They're not the one who committed the infidelity; the married man did. The user is now trying to resolve their guilt by informing the wife, but doing so would violate the man's privacy and their agreement. However, the wife's right to know is significant. But the user isn't in a position to make that decision for others. They might be in the wrong for planning to expose him, as it could cause more harm than good, especially if it's not their role to intervene. Alternatively, the married man's actions are the main issue here. The user's role is a participant, so they might share some responsibility. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, they're in the wrong) because they were part of the cheating relationship and now their decision to expose him could cause further harm without their authority to do so. They should consider other options, like advising the man to come clean himself or seeking professional help, rather than taking it upon themselves to out him.\n"
