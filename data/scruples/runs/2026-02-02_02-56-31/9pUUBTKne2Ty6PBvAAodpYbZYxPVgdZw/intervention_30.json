  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheating spouse, which would out him as gay. They had a relationship without knowing he was married, and now they're conflicted between the wife's right to know and not outing him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person has been in a non-consensual relationship with a married man. He's in the closet, so coming out could have significant personal and family consequences. The user is considering informing the wife about the affair, which would out him. The dilemma is between exposing the cheating and protecting his privacy.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is a serious issue, and the wife does have a right to know if her spouse is unfaithful. However, the act of outing someone without their consent can also have severe repercussions. The user might be in a tricky position where they want to do the right thing but are unsure which side of the moral dilemma is more important.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, the user isn't committing a crime by sharing the information. Legally, it's not wrong to inform someone that their spouse is cheating, but it can lead to complications. The ethical part is more about intent and consequences. Did the user act with malicious intent? The user seems to be acting out of a sense of obligation to the wife rather than malice towards the man.\n\nThe user's responsibility here is a bit ambiguous. They were part of an affair without knowing the man was married. Now, they're trying to report the infidelity, which is a valid concern for the wife. However, doing so would out him, which could be a betrayal of his trust. The question is whether the user has a duty to the wife over the man they slept with.\n\nAnother angle is the user's own accountability. By engaging in the affair without knowing the marital status, they contributed to the situation. They might feel guilt, which is why they're conflicted. However, if they were unaware, their responsibility might be less. The main issue is whether they should proceed with informing the wife despite the consequences for him.\n\nPossible solutions: They could inform the wife without disclosing their own involvement, which might protect the man's privacy. But if they don't mention their role, the wife might not get the full picture. Alternatively, they could encourage the man to come out to his wife on his own, but he's not ready for that.\n\nThe user's primary concern is moral responsibility. They're caught between two wrongs: outing someone and allowing a spouse to be cheated on. The answer hinges on which moral obligation takes precedence. In many ethical frameworks, honesty and transparency are valued, but so is respecting privacy and consent.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. However, the method of doing so without outing the man is crucial. If they can find a way to report the infidelity without revealing his sexuality, that might be the ethical path. Since the user is torn and trying to do the right thing, the answer leans towards not being in the wrong, but with the caveat that they should proceed carefully to minimize harm.\n"
