I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The scenario involves a complex situation with multiple moral considerations.\n\nFirst, the author had a sexual relationship with someone they met at a wedding. The usher was married, so the author was part of an affair. The usher is gay but closeted. The author is conflicted because they want to tell the wife about the cheating but don't want to out him, especially considering his family's possible reaction.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is generally considered wrong. The author was in an affair, which is a problem. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong now for considering exposing the cheater. The key points are the obligation to the wife versus respecting the usher's privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nThe wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The author's decision to inform her could be seen as upholding the wife's rights. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a serious invasion of privacy, especially when they're not ready to come out. The author is in a difficult position because they want to do the right thing for the wife but don't want to harm the usher.\n\nBut wait, the author was also part of the cheating. They might have a responsibility to the wife, but they also had their own role in the affair. The fact that they continued the relationship after finding out the usher was married adds complexity. They might have a duty to both the wife and the usher. However, the usher's closeted status complicates things. The author's initial promise of confidentiality is important here. Breaking that promise could hurt the usher, especially if the author is the one to out him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering the exposure. The answer might depend on context. If the author is trying to protect the wife by exposing the cheating, that's a positive intent. But the method of exposure involves outing him, which is a different issue. There might be a way to inform the wife without revealing the usher's sexuality, but the author isn't sure. If they can find a way to tell the wife without outing him, that would be better. But if the only way to do it is by outing him, then the author has to weigh the consequences.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's original actions (cheating) were wrong. Now, the dilemma is about the next step. The question is whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater. The answer hinges on whether their intent is to do the right thing despite the consequences. Since they want to inform the wife (which is a just action) but are trying to avoid harming the usher (also a just action), it's a tough call. However, the fact that the author was part of the cheating complicates their authority to act in the wife's interest. They might not be the best person to inform the wife, but they feel obligated. \n\nOverall, the author's intentions are mixed. They did wrong by being part of the affair but are trying to make amends by informing the wife. However, the act of outing someone without their consent is another ethical violation. The answer could be that they are not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they might be in the wrong for how they do it. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the scenario, the answer is likely B (No), but with the caveat that the method of exposure matters. However, given the information, the answer is B.\n"
