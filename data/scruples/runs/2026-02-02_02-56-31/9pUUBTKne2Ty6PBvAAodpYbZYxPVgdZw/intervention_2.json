I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. They slept with someone they later found out is married and gay, and now they're conflicted between not outing him and telling the wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The person had a relationship with someone who was married, so they were part of an affair. They might feel guilt because they know how it feels to be cheated on. But they also promised not to out him initially. Now they want to tell the wife, which would break that promise.\n\nOn one hand, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent is a violation of their privacy, especially if they're not ready. The person is in a dilemma between honesty and respecting someone's confidentiality. \n\nBut they also have to consider their own role in the situation. They were involved in the affair, so they might have a responsibility to disclose the infidelity. However, how they go about it matters. Maybe there's a way to inform the wife without outing the man as gay. For example, just telling her he's been unfaithful without revealing his sexuality. \n\nBut if they can't do that, then they might have to choose between the two. The key here is whether they have the right to expose someone else's secrets, even for a good reason. Also, they need to think about their own motives\u2014are they trying to help the wife, or maybe they feel guilty and want to absolve themselves?\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the person acted with good intentions (helping the wife) but it leads to outing someone, maybe they're not entirely wrong. However, if they break the trust they had with the man, that could be seen as wrong. The question is whether they have a moral obligation to the wife over the man's privacy. \n\nI think the answer is that they're not in the wrong because their intention is to inform the wife about the infidelity, which is a valid concern. But they should try to avoid outing him if possible. However, if outing is inevitable, they might have to proceed carefully. So maybe the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
