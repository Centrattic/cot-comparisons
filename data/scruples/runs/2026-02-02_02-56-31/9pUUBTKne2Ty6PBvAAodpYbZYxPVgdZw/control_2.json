I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a complex set of actions and decisions.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with a married man who is secretly gay and in the closet. They had multiple affairs, which is cheating on both the husband's part and the author's part if they were in a committed relationship themselves. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him as gay.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and actions. The author initially agreed not to out the man, respecting his privacy. Now, upon discovering he's married with kids, they feel conflicted between the wife's right to know and not outing him. The author is considering exposing the infidelity, which would reveal his sexuality, potentially causing family issues and distress for him.\n\nBut wait, the author was in an affair themselves. If they were in a relationship, that's cheating. However, the question isn't whether the author is in the wrong for the affair, but for deciding to expose the cheater. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it out him.\n\nThe main ethical dilemma is between the wife's right to know about her husband's infidelity and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author is trying to balance these. The question is whether it's the author's responsibility to step in here. \n\nIf the author isn't the one who originally cheated, but is now considering exposing the husband's infidelity (which would out him), does that make them in the wrong? Well, if the author is acting out of a sense of obligation to the wife, but the method involves outing him, which can have serious consequences, especially in a family that might not be accepting. \n\nBut the author is not the one who committed the infidelity; the husband did. The author's role here is as an accomplice to the infidelity, which could be a factor. However, the question is about the act of exposing the cheater, not the affair itself. \n\nIf the author is going to tell the wife, they are essentially using information obtained during their affair to report him. But since the husband is the one who cheated, the author might feel a conflict. However, the method of exposing him (outing his sexuality) adds another layer. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for choosing to expose him in a way that out him, despite his request for privacy? It depends on whether the author has a moral obligation to the wife versus respecting the man's privacy. If the author doesn't owe a duty to the wife, perhaps they're not in the wrong. But if they have no right to interfere, maybe they are. \n\nAlternatively, the author's own participation in the affair might make them complicit, so their actions to expose the cheater could be seen as self-serving or trying to cover their own tracks. But the scenario doesn't mention the author being in a relationship themselves, so maybe they're single. \n\nIn summary, the author's decision to expose the cheater by outing him is a moral dilemma. The key factors are the potential harm to the man's family and his personal privacy versus the wife's right to know. Since the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity (the husband did), but they were an accomplice, it's a complex situation. However, the act of exposing him by outing his sexuality might be ethically wrong, even if the infidelity is a separate issue. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for choosing to out him, regardless of the infidelity.\n"
