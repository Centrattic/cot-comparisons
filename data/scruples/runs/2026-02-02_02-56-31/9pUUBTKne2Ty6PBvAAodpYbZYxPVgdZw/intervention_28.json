I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for potentially exposing a cheater, even though it might out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a relationship with a married man who's gay and closeted. They found out he's married with kids, so he's cheating on his wife. Now they're conflicted between reporting the cheating (which would out him) and keeping quiet to protect his privacy and his family's feelings.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong if they choose to tell the wife. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom the perspective of the wife, she has a right to know about the infidelity. Cheating is a serious breach in a marriage. But the person here is not a direct party to the marriage; they're a third party. They might feel an obligation to inform the wife, but does that obligation exist?\n\nOn the other hand, the man is in the closet, and outing him could have significant consequences. His family might not accept it, leading to potential harm. The person is caught between two moral issues: the wife's right to know versus the man's right to privacy regarding his sexual orientation.\n\nIs there a way to inform the wife without outing him? Maybe, but it's tricky. If the person tells the wife about the infidelity without revealing the man's sexuality, but the wife finds out through other means, there's a risk. Alternatively, if the person tells the wife, the wife might deduce he's gay, leading to outing indirectly.\n\nLegally, the person isn't breaking any laws by reporting the infidelity. Morally, it's a gray area. The person wasn't in a position to know the context initially, but now they do. They have conflicting loyalties: their friend's sister's family and the wife.\n\nAnother angle: the person slept with the man knowing he was in a committed (though not necessarily open) relationship. Wait, the man was married. So the person is also complicit in the cheating. That might affect their moral standing. If they had known he was married, they wouldn't have had the affair. But they did, which makes them part of the situation.\n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong for exposing him. If the exposure is to prevent further harm to the wife, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, outing someone without consent is generally frowned upon unless there's a public interest. Here, the public interest is the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nSo, the person's actions could be seen as justified in protecting the wife, but they might also be in the wrong for outing someone against his wishes. It's a tough call. The fact that the person is also complicit as a cheater might shift responsibility more onto them, but the dilemma remains.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the person is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it's a complex situation. But there's a risk they could be wrong for outing him. However, given the circumstances, the obligation to the wife might outweigh the obligation to keep the man's secret.\n"
