I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a complex situation where the author is in a secret relationship with someone who's married and in the closet. The main question is whether the author should expose the cheater, even if it means outing him.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with the married man, who is gay and closeted. The key points here are consent and the man's marital status. The author was aware he was in a closeted situation but didn't know about the marriage until later. Now, the author is conflicted between protecting the man's privacy and informing the wife about the infidelity.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, adultery isn't a crime in many places, but ethically, cheating is a serious breach in a marriage. The author didn't know about the marriage initially, which complicates things. However, the author is now aware and faces a dilemma. The wife has a right to know if her husband is cheating, but outing someone against their will could harm the author's relationship with the family and the man himself.\n\nThe author's position is that they don't want to out the man, given the family's potential reaction. But there's an obligation to the wife. However, the author is not in a position to dictate the man's decisions about coming out. The decision to come out is his to make. The author's role here is to consider their own actions: were they wrong to have the affair, and is it their responsibility to inform the wife?\n\nSince the author had consensual relationships without knowing the marital status initially, they might share some responsibility. But now that they know, the question is whether they have a duty to the wife. However, the author isn't a family member or someone with a direct responsibility. The wife might not take kindly to being informed by a third party, especially if it's through a secret affair. The author isn't the husband's partner or parent; they're an outsider.\n\nThe primary moral wrong here is the husband's infidelity and being closeted. The author's dilemma is whether to act as a whistleblower. But since the author is also complicit in the affair, their judgment might be clouded. If they expose him, they might be doing the right thing for the wife but violating the man's privacy. If they don't, they're letting the wife be deceived. But the author isn't in a position of authority to decide for the man. The author's own actions might be questionable, but the question is whether they are in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is the one who committed adultery. The author's role is more about their own actions and the consequences of exposing someone else. The author's decision to inform the wife would have significant repercussions, but it's not necessarily their fault for considering it. However, the author's initial involvement in the affair could be seen as unethical, but since they didn't know about the marriage at first, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nUltimately, the author is facing a tough choice between two wrongs. The correct answer would likely be B, not in the wrong, because they're trying to address a moral issue without being the primary wrongdoer. The main responsibility lies with the cheating husband, and the author's intent to inform the wife is a way to correct a wrong, even if it complicates things.\n"
