  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person had a relationship with someone who's married and possibly not the only one. The main question is whether exposing the cheater by telling the wife is the right move, considering it might out him.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: they had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They were told not to tell anyone he's gay, and they respected that. Now, they found out he's married and cheating, maybe through Grindr. They feel conflicted about exposing him to the wife but don't want to out him.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. Cheating is a betrayal in marriage, and she's entitled to that information. However, the user is also considering his privacy regarding his sexuality. Outing someone can have serious consequences, especially in a conservative family. But since he's already cheating, there's a breach of trust in his marriage.\n\nMoral dilemma: Should they protect his privacy about being gay, even if he's a cheater? Or does the wife's right to know supersede his privacy? The user might feel they're in the wrong if they expose him, because they agreed not to out him. But they might not be in the wrong if they prioritize the wife's right to know about the cheating.\n\nAlso, the user's own actions are questionable. They were involved in a relationship with a married man, which could be seen as contributing to the infidelity. However, if they were unaware he was married, maybe they're not at fault. But they continued the relationship after knowing about the marriage, which complicates things.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the user's intent to protect his identity as a gay man while exposing the cheating is justified. If they can expose the cheating without outing him, that's better. But if the only way to inform the wife is by revealing his sexuality, then it's a tough call.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the user might be considered wrong if they violate the trust he placed in them by not outing him. However, the wife's right to know about the cheating is strong. The user is in a tough spot, but the main question is whether their actions cross into wrongdoing. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they're trying to inform the wife of the cheating, which is a valid concern, even if it risks outing him. But there's nuance here.\n"
