  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA for exposing a cheater, if it meant outing him in the process?\nSo I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a morally complex situation where they had an affair with a married man who's also in the closet about being gay. They're now considering exposing the man's infidelity to his wife, which would involve outing him, potentially causing family issues. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user had consensual relationships with the man, who was already married and not out about his sexuality. They didn't know he was married initially, which complicates things. The user now wants to inform the wife but is conflicted about outing him. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, cheating itself isn't illegal, but the user isn't the one being cheated on. The wife has a right to know if her husband is unfaithful, but the user isn't her spouse, so their obligation isn't clear. Ethically, though, the user is in a tough spot. They have a duty to the wife to inform her of the infidelity but also a promise to the man to keep his secret. \n\nOuting someone can have serious consequences, especially if the family is not accepting. The user's actions could lead to emotional harm for the man, his wife, and the children. But the wife deserves to know about the betrayal. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? They were complicit in the affair, which could be seen as contributing to the harm. However, they might feel they're doing the right thing by informing the wife. The key points are consent and harm. The user had consensual relations, which is their own business, but using that information to expose him could be seen as violating his privacy. But the wife's right to know complicates this. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because the user broke their promise of confidentiality to the man, which is a direct betrayal of trust. Even if the intention is to do the right thing for the wife, the method of informing her (outing) might be harmful. The user's actions could cause more harm than good, affecting multiple people's lives. The fact that they had an affair with a married person also puts them in a position where they shouldn't meddle in the marriage. So, yes, they're in the wrong for both having the affair and then exposing the man's secrets.\n"
