I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having an affair with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. The author is considering exposing the man's infidelity, which would out him as gay, potentially causing family issues.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship without knowing the man was married. That's a problem because he's cheating on his wife. The author didn't know, but after finding out, they're conflicted about whether to tell the wife. \n\nThe man is in the closet, so outing him could have serious consequences for him and his family. The author is concerned about causing harm there. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. \n\nThe author's main dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy and informing the wronged spouse. The key points here are intent and consequences. The author didn't initially know the man was married and had a consensual relationship, but after discovering the infidelity, they're trying to do the right thing by the wife. However, the method of informing the wife would out the husband, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were part of an affair, which isn't ideal, but they didn't know the man was married at the start. Now they're trying to make amends by informing the wife, even though it's difficult. The question is whether they should prioritize the wife's right to know over the husband's privacy. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't directly responsible for the husband's infidelity, but they are part of it. However, the act of exposing the cheating could be seen as necessary to protect the wife. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it means outing the husband. The real issue is how to do it without causing unnecessary harm. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), because they're trying to correct a wrong they were inadvertently part of, and the moral obligation to the wife's right to know might outweigh the privacy concerns, especially if there's a way to do it discreetly. But the answer could also be A if the act of outing the husband is considered too harmful. However, since the author is trying to do the right thing, even if the method is challenging, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
