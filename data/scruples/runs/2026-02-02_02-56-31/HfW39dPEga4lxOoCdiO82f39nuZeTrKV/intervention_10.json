My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their scheduled time. They have a 50/50 custody agreement and they didn't switch weeks even though the ex wanted to take them to Disneyland during the user's week.\n\nFirst, the key points: The custody agreement is set every other week, and they agreed not to switch unless it's extremely important. The user has followed this agreement strictly for 8 years. The ex approached to switch a week for a family reunion, but the user refused. Now the kids are upset because they think the user is blocking them from going, and the ex isn't helping.\n\nI need to consider if the user's actions are justified. The legal aspect is important here. If the custody agreement is legally binding and specifies that they can't switch unless both agree, then the user is within their rights. The ex's request is during the user's scheduled week, so unless there's a legal provision allowing for exceptions, the user isn't in the wrong. The kids are upset because they were told the user is being the bad guy, but the user's stance is about upholding the agreement. The ex's refusal to apologize and his sarcastic comments might indicate he's trying to manipulate the kids. The user's frustration is understandable as they're sticking to the agreement they both made. There's no indication the user violated any terms. The ex's actions might be the problem here, trying to get the kids to resent the user. So, based on the information given, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
