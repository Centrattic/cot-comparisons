My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a custody arrangement and a vacation trip.\n\nFirst, the key points: The parents have a 50/50 custody agreement, switching every other week. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week. The author refused to switch weeks, leading to the kids being upset and the ex painting the author as the bad guy.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole. The main issue is whether it's fair to not let the kids go on vacation with the other parent during the custodial parent's time. The custody agreement was set up to have specific weeks, and the author hasn't switched days before unless it's extremely important. The ex's parents scheduled the trip during the author's week, and the author is sticking to the agreement.\n\nCustody agreements are legally binding, so the author is probably following the terms they've both agreed to. The ex is trying to bend the rules for a vacation, which the author isn't willing to do. The kids are upset because they think the author is preventing them from going. But legally, the author has the right to their time. However, emotionally, the kids might be confused or hurt if they want to spend time with the other parent. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't out of spite but based on the custody terms. The ex is trying to manipulate the kids by making the author the villain. The author tried to get an apology, which the ex refused. So, is the author in the wrong? Legally, no. Emotionally, it's complicated because the kids are upset, but the author isn't violating the custody agreement. The ex is the one trying to change the schedule without the custodial parent's consent. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to the custody agreement. The ex is the one making the request outside the agreed terms. The kids are upset, but the author isn't at fault for following the legal arrangement.\n"
