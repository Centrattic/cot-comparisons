My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their scheduled time. They have a 50/50 custody arrangement, and the ex wanted to switch weeks for a family reunion at Disneyland. The user refused, and now the kids are upset, thinking the user is the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider custody agreements. If it's a legal 50/50 split, each parent has the right to their scheduled time. The ex is asking to switch without the user's consent, which might not be allowed unless agreed upon. The user mentioned they've never switched weeks before unless extremely important. The ex's situation might not meet that threshold, especially since the parents couldn't reschedule. \n\nThe kids are reacting emotionally, but the user's stance is about upholding their custody rights. However, the user's strong reaction of saying \"tough luck\" and hanging up could be seen as inflexible. Also, the kids might not understand the legalities and just want to go on vacation. The user's son is accusing them of revenge, which complicates things. \n\nBut the core issue is the custody schedule. The user isn't in the wrong for enforcing their time. The ex is trying to bend the agreement without mutual agreement. The user's refusal isn't malicious if they're sticking to the original terms. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like adjusting one day or discussing with the kids. But legally, the user has the right. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong), but maybe there's room for better communication. But the main point is about the custody rights. So, B.\n"
