My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their custody time. \n\nFirst, the custody arrangement is 50/50, switching every other week. They've had this setup for 8 years and both agree not to plan things on each other's days unless it's super important. The user has never given up their time before, and this time they refused the ex's request to switch weeks for a family reunion at Disneyland. The ex is blaming the user for not letting the kids go, which is making the kids upset and angry.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is in the wrong by sticking to their custody schedule. The user's reasoning is that the ex scheduled the trip during their time, so it's not their fault. They also mention that they've always followed the agreement strictly and that the ex is trying to make them look bad in front of the kids. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the ex's parents had the reunion scheduled before the custody agreement, or maybe there was some flexibility they didn't consider. But the user says the ex's parents couldn't reschedule, so maybe there's no alternative. The kids are feeling hurt because they wanted to go, and the user is being seen as the bad guy. However, legally and according to their custody agreement, the user is within their rights to use their scheduled time. \n\nBut the kids' feelings are important too. The user might need to communicate better with them, explain the situation, and maybe find other ways to make up for missing the trip. However, the ex is using the kids to manipulate the situation, which is problematic. The user isn't the one breaking the agreement here. They're standing by their rights as per the custody plan. \n\nSo, considering the agreement and the user's history of following it, they're probably not in the wrong. The ex is overstepping by trying to switch weeks without agreement, and the user is justified in refusing. The kids are upset due to their ex's influence, not the user's fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
