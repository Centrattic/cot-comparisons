My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their kids go on a vacation with their ex during their own custody week. They have a 50/50 custody agreement, which has been in place for 8 years, and they haven't switched weeks unless it's extremely important. The ex wanted to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's week, but the user refused. Now the kids are upset and think the user is the bad guy because the ex painted it that way.\n\nFirst, I need to check the custody agreement terms. The user says they've never switched days unless it's extremely important. The ex is asking to switch a week for a family reunion, but the user's position is that it's their time. The user's reasoning is that the ex scheduled it during their week, so the responsibility is on the ex to reschedule. The ex's parents can't change the date, according to him, and the kids are upset because they feel they can't go.\n\nLegally, 50/50 custody agreements usually require both parents to communicate and make decisions in the child's best interest. However, the terms of the agreement might specify how to handle scheduling conflicts. Since the user has a policy of not switching unless it's extremely important, and the ex is trying to make an exception here, maybe the user is upholding the agreement. But the kids are now upset, thinking the user is blocking them from the vacation.\n\nThe user is frustrated because they feel it's their right to spend time with the kids during their week. The ex's parents planned the event during the user's week, so perhaps the ex should have considered that. The user isn't budging, which is causing conflict with the kids. The kids are blaming the user because the ex is presenting the situation that way. The user tried to explain but the kids aren't listening.\n\nI need to consider if the user is being unreasonable. The ex's request is for a family event, but the user's stance is that it's their scheduled time. The user isn't willing to switch, which is within their rights if the agreement doesn't allow for such exceptions unless both agree. However, the emotional impact on the kids is significant. The user might be prioritizing their own time over the kids' desire to go, which could be seen as selfish. But the user is also trying to uphold the custody agreement.\n\nThe key points are the terms of the custody agreement and the impact on the children. If the agreement allows for no switching without consensus, the user is following it. However, the kids are in emotional distress, which might require a different approach. The user might need to find a middle ground, like allowing the kids to go part of the week but keeping some time, but they didn't offer that. The ex is using the kids to turn them against the user, which is manipulative. \n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for enforcing their scheduled time, but their approach might be contributing to the kids' distress. The answer might depend on the specific legal terms of their custody agreement. Since the user has maintained the agreement strictly and the ex is trying to get an exception, the user isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
