My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their assigned week. They have a 50/50 custody agreement and the ex wanted to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's week. The user refused, and now the kids are upset and the ex is being uncooperative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider custody agreements. Since it's a legal 50/50 split, the parent who has custody during a specific time has the right to make decisions for the kids during that period unless there's a court order allowing the other parent to make exceptions. The user hasn't given up their time, which might be their right. The ex is trying to use their week for the family reunion, but it's scheduled during the user's time. \n\nThe kids are being told that the user is the bad guy for not allowing the trip. But from a legal standpoint, the user is following the custody agreement. The ex might be trying to manipulate the situation by portraying the user negatively. The user's children are upset because they want to go on the trip, but the parent isn't at fault for sticking to the agreement. \n\nThe user's reaction of refusing to switch weeks is within their rights. They didn't make the ex's parents schedule the trip during their week. The ex's actions might be the problem here, trying to change arrangements without agreement. The kids being upset is sad, but the user's responsibility is to uphold the custody agreement unless there's a mutual agreement to switch. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the user is adhering to the custody terms, and the ex is the one trying to bend the rules without permission. The user isn't being unreasonable by not switching weeks unless there's a valid reason, which the ex hasn't provided. The blame here is likely on the ex for scheduling during the user's time and then trying to make the user the villain.\n"
