My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their kids go on a vacation with their ex during their own custody week. The situation involves a 50/50 custody arrangement where both parents switch weeks. The ex wanted to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's week, and the user refused. Now the kids are upset, thinking the user is blocking them from going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider custody agreements. If it's a legal 50/50 split, the user probably has the right to keep the kids during their scheduled week. The ex's parents planned the reunion during the user's time, and the user didn't agree to switch weeks. The ex tried to pressure them to move the kids, but the user stood their ground. \n\nThe kids are upset because they were told the user\u4e0d\u8ba9 them go. The user is frustrated because they feel the ex is being unfair by scheduling something during their time. The user's reasoning is that the ex shouldn't expect to move the kids without mutual agreement. The ex, however, is trying to frame the user as the bad guy, which could be causing the kids' anger.\n\nI need to check if refusing to switch weeks is valid. Since the custody agreement specifies not switching unless mutually agreed, the user isn't in the wrong for sticking to the terms. The ex's parents' event being planned during the user's week doesn't change the custody agreement. The user has the right to spend their scheduled time with the kids. \n\nHowever, maybe there's an argument that the kids' desire to go to Disneyland is important. But the user's right to custody during their week is non-negotiable unless both parties agree. The user isn't forcing the kids to stay; they're using their legal time. The ex's approach of manipulating the kids to blame the user is problematic. \n\nSo, in terms of legal rights, the user isn't at fault. Emotionally, the kids are hurt because they were told they can't go, but that's due to the ex's actions. The user's stance is justified under the custody agreement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
