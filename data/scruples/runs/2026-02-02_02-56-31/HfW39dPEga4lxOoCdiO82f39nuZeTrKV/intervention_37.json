My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their scheduled time. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have a 50/50 custody arrangement, which they've been following for 8 years. The ex wants to take the kids to a family reunion at Disneyland during the user's week, but the user refuses. The ex is now making the kids think the user is being unfair, leading to the kids being upset.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they've always stuck to the custody schedule and the ex is trying to change it now for their own plans. The ex claims it's important and can't reschedule. The user feels the ex is being unfair by not respecting the agreed-upon schedule.\n\nNow, considering the custody agreement: If it's a legal 50/50 arrangement, the user has the right to have the kids during their scheduled time. The ex is asking to switch weeks, which the user has never done before. The user is standing by the agreement they've both followed for years. The ex's parents scheduled it during the user's time, so maybe they should have considered that earlier.\n\nBut the kids are upset because they think the user is blocking the trip. The user tried to explain, but the kids are taking the ex's side. The user is frustrated because the ex isn't cooperating and is painting them as the bad guy.\n\nLegally, the user isn't in the wrong if the custody schedule is set and the ex isn't following it. However, maybe there's a way to be more flexible. But the user hasn't done that before, and the ex hasn't offered a reasonable alternative. The ex's refusal to reschedule despite the user's request might be the problem.\n\nThe kids are old enough (16 and 9) to understand the situation, but the 9-year-old is still young. The user is trying to protect their time with the kids, which is their right. The ex is undermining them by not being honest with the kids. The user's anger is justified because the custody arrangement was agreed upon, and the ex is trying to change it now for their own benefit.\n\nSo, based on this, the user isn't in the wrong. They're upholding the custody schedule they've followed for years. The ex is the one violating the agreement by attempting to take the kids during the user's time without a valid reason. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
