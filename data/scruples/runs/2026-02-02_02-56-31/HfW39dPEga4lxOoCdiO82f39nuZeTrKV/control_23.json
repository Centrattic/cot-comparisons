My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a divorced parent and their ex-spouse trying to switch custody weeks for a vacation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. They have a 50/50 custody arrangement that's been in place for 8 years. Both parents agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs and rarely switch. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the writer's week. The writer refused, and now the kids are upset, thinking the writer is blocking them from going.\n\nThe key points here are the custody agreement terms. The writer mentions they've strictly followed the agreement, never switching weeks even when asked. The ex is now trying to switch, but the writer says no. The ex is portrayed as the one initiating the request, but the writer is standing by the agreement. The kids are upset because they were led to believe the mom is the bad guy for not letting them go, but the ex is the one who made the request during the mom's time.\n\nLegally, if the custody agreement states no switching unless mutually agreed, the writer is within their rights. Emotionally, the kids are upset because they want to go on vacation, but the mom is sticking to the schedule. The ex is manipulating the situation by making the mom out to be the villain, which is problematic. The writer's anger is justified because the ex is violating the agreed-upon terms by making a unilateral request.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The answer depends on the custody agreement's terms. Since the writer followed the agreement and the ex is the one trying to change it without mutual consent, the writer isn't at fault. The ex is the one violating the terms here. The kids' reactions are based on the ex's manipulation, so the writer isn't the bad guy in this scenario. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
