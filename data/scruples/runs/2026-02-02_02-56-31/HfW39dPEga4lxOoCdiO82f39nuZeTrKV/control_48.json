My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the parent who refused to let their kids go on a vacation with the ex during their scheduled time is at fault.\n\nFirst, looking at the custody arrangement: it's a 50/50 split, with each parent having the kids every other week. The key point here is the agreement they have in place, which they've followed for 8 years. The author has never switched weeks unless it was a special case, and the ex is now trying to get them to switch for a family reunion at Disneyland.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the ex scheduled something during their week, so it's their time to spend with the kids. The ex wants to switch weeks, but the author refuses, sticking to the original agreement. The kids are upset because the ex is portraying the author as the bad guy\u4e0d\u8ba9\u53bb\u8fea\u58eb\u5c3c.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. In a 50/50 custody arrangement, unless there's a specific exception or mutual agreement, each parent has the right to their scheduled time. The ex is asking for a switch, but the author is not obligated to do so unless it's an emergency or mutually agreed. The author isn't violating the custody agreement by not switching. \n\nHowever, there's a conflict in communication. The ex is using the kids as intermediaries, not directly communicating with the author. The author's refusal to switch might be seen as rigid, but given the long-standing agreement, it's within their rights. The kids are caught in the middle, which is unfortunate, but the author's actions are based on following the custody terms.\n\nThe kids are upset because they want to go to Disneyland, and the ex is framing the author as the villain. The author is trying to explain their position, but the kids are emotionally affected. The author isn't intentionally trying to harm the kids but is standing by their custody rights.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for adhering to the custody agreement they've had for years. The ex is the one initiating the change without a valid reason, and the author is justified in refusing. The kids' distress is more a result of the ex's manipulation and the situation, not the author's actions.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are following their custody agreement and the ex is the one seeking a unilateral change.\n"
