My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about custody and a vacation. So, the user has a 50/50 custody agreement, which they've been following for 8 years. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's custodial week. The user refused to switch weeks, and now the kids are upset, thinking the parent is being selfish.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement was agreed upon by both parties. The user mentioned they've never switched weeks unless necessary. The ex is asking here because their parents are hosting a reunion. The user's main argument is that it's their time with the kids, and the ex is trying to take it, which the user sees as unfair. The user also says they explained the custody agreement but the kids don't believe them, thinking the parent is being mean.\n\nNow, considering legal custody terms, if it's a legal agreement, the user probably has the right to their scheduled weeks. The ex might be in the wrong for not respecting that. However, the kids are confused because their ex-parent is painting the user as the bad guy. The user is frustrated because they think they're sticking to the agreement, but the kids are upset.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The user is strict about not switching weeks, but maybe in an exception for a big trip? However, the user's stance is that they've never given up their weeks before, so consistency is key. The ex might be using the kids to pressure the user into switching. The user's refusal isn't out of meanness, but about upholding the agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, the kids are young. The daughter is 9, so she might not understand why she can't go. The son is 16, but still might feel his father wants to take him. The user's approach might be seen as not flexible, but the ex is violating the agreement by scheduling during the user's time. The user's right to their custody time is important. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They're following the custody agreement, and the ex is the one trying to disrupt it. The user isn't being unreasonable by sticking to the terms they both agreed on. The answer should be B (No).\n"
