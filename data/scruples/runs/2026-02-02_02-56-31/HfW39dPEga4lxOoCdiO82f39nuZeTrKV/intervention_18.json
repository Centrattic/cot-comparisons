My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a parent in a 50/50 custody situation with their ex. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's scheduled time, but the user refuses. The kids are upset because their ex-parent is making them think the user is the bad guy for not letting them go. The user is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement is a legal arrangement that both parents agreed to. The user has followed the schedule strictly for 8 years, not switching days unless necessary. The ex is now trying to change the schedule for a family reunion, which the user sees as unfair. The user isn't being flexible here, but the ex also might not be considering the user's rights. \n\nThe kids are caught in the middle, and the ex is using them to manipulate the situation by not being honest. The user's refusal isn't malicious; they're standing by the custody agreement. However, the user is causing emotional distress to the kids, who feel torn between their parents. \n\nThe ex's approach is problematic because they're using the kids to undermine the user without being truthful. But the user's rigidity might also be part of the issue. Maybe there's a middle ground, like adjusting schedules or discussing alternatives. However, the user's stance is within their legal rights. \n\nConsidering the situation, the user isn't in the wrong for upholding their custody agreement. The ex is violating their agreement by trying to switch weeks without discussion. The user's anger is justified, but the communication breakdown is affecting the kids. However, the user isn't the asshole here because they're protecting their rights as a parent. The ex's behavior is more to blame for the conflict and manipulation.\n"
