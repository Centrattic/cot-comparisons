My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a custody agreement where the parent and ex have a 50/50 split, switching every other week. The user is refusing to let their kids go with the ex to a family reunion at Disneyland because it's their week. The ex is trying to get the kids to go during the user's time, and the kids are upset, thinking the user is the bad guy.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement was set up with the rule that they don't plan things on each other's days unless necessary. The user has followed this strictly for 8 years. The ex is now asking to switch weeks for a family event, but the user says no. The ex is framing the user as not allowing the kids to go, which is making the kids angry towards the user.\n\nThe user's argument is that the ex scheduled the event during their time, so they're just using their right to have the kids. The ex is refusing to set the record straight with the kids, which is causing the kids to believe the user is being unfair.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Let's consider legal and emotional aspects. Legally, if the custody agreement doesn't have a provision for switching weeks except in extreme cases, then the user is within their rights. The ex is trying to bend the rules for a family event, which might not be a valid reason under their agreement. The user has been consistent, which is important for the kids' stability.\n\nEmotionally, the kids are upset because they want to go to Disneyland. The user's refusal is causing tension, but the ex is using the kids to push their agenda. The user is trying to explain their side, but the kids are not listening because of how the ex is portraying the situation. The user isn't at fault here because they're upholding the agreed terms. The ex is the one breaking the agreement by trying to schedule during the user's time without a switch, which isn't allowed unless both agree. The user's actions are justified under the terms they've both followed. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
