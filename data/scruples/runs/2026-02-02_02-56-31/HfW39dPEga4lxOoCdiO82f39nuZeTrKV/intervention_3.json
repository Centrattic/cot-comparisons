My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing their kids to go on vacation with their ex during their own custody week. They have a 50/50 custody agreement, and the ex wanted to switch weeks for a family reunion at Disneyland, but the user refused. The kids are upset and the ex is blaming the user.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement: They have a structured 50/50 schedule with mutual agreement on not switching days unless extremely important. The user has stuck to this for 8 years without issues. The ex now wants to switch weeks for a family event, which is scheduled during the user's time. The user says no, thinking it's their right to have the kids during their appointed week. The ex told the kids the user is being unreasonable, leading to the kids being upset.\n\nLegally, if the custody agreement is set, unless there's a court order allowing for changes, the user isn't in the wrong. The ex can't unilaterally switch weeks without agreement. The user isn't violating the terms by refusing to switch. However, the ex might not be following the agreement properly by trying to switch without mutual consent. \n\nEmotionally, the user is frustrated because the kids are taking sides, but the user's stance is about upholding the custody schedule. The user isn't the one breaking the agreement; the ex is trying to alter it without consent. The user's response, while firm, is within their rights. The ex's actions are manipulative by making the user the villain to the kids. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for sticking to the custody terms. The ex is the one violating the agreement by requesting a switch without mutual agreement. The user's refusal is justified, and the ex's actions are the problem here. The answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
