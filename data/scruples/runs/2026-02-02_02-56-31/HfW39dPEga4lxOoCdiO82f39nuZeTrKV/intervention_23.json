My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their kids go on a vacation with their ex during their scheduled time. They have a 50/50 custody arrangement, and the ex is trying to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's week. The user says they've never switched weeks before and stuck to the agreement, but the ex is now asking for a switch. The kids are upset, and the ex is painting the user as the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider custody agreements. If it's a legal 50/50 split, the user's time is their legal right. The ex is asking to switch a week for a family event, but the user has been firm about not giving up their time. The ex's parents scheduled it during the user's week, which might not have been considered. The user's refusal isn't causing the problem; the ex's scheduling might have been the issue. The kids are being manipulated by the ex, which is a red flag. The user is trying to enforce the custody agreement, which is their right. The ex's actions of making the kids upset and not being honest could be the problem here.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. The user could have considered the kids' feelings and found a solution, but the ex didn't respect the existing agreement. The user's stance is about upholding the custody terms, which is valid. The ex's refusal to reschedule or communicate properly might be the real issue. The kids are caught in the middle, but the user isn't the one breaking the agreement. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
