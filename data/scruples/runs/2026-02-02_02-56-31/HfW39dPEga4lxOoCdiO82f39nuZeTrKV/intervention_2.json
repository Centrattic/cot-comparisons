My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about custody and vacation time. The user has a 50/50 custody agreement with their ex, switching every other week. The ex wanted to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's week, but the user refused because it's their time. The kids are upset, and the ex is being difficult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If they have a 50/50 custody agreement that's been in place for 8 years, it's likely court-ordered or at least mutually agreed upon. The user mentions they haven't switched days unless it's extremely important. The ex is asking to switch a week for a family reunion, which the user says is during their time. Legally, unless the agreement allows for such changes, the user has the right to their scheduled time.\n\nBut wait, the ex claims it's the only week the family can go. The user's stance is that the ex should reschedule if it's important. But the ex's parents can't change their plans. However, the user might be within their rights to not give up their week. The problem is the ex is making the kids think the user is the bad guy for not letting them go. The user is trying to explain it's their time, but the kids are upset.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the ex scheduled the event during their time without considering the custody agreement. The ex might be at fault for not planning ahead or not respecting the agreement. The user's anger is understandable because they feel their rights as a parent are being undermined. The kids are caught in the middle, which is tough, but the user is trying to stand their ground.\n\nHowever, sometimes in co-parenting, flexibility is needed. If the reunion is a once-in-a-lifetime event, maybe the user's rigidity is causing emotional harm. But the user has a history of not switching days unless necessary, so maybe this is a matter of principle. The ex's approach of making the kids blame the user is manipulative, which is definitely wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong for upholding their custody rights. The ex is the one pushing for a switch without valid agreement. The user's actions are justified, even if the kids are upset. The ex's manipulation is the real issue here.\n"
