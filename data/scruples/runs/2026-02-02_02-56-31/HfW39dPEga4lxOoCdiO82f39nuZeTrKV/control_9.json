My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about custody and a vacation plan.\n\nThe author and their ex have a 50/50 custody agreement, alternating weeks. The ex wanted to take the kids to Disneyland for a family reunion during the author's week. The author refused, saying it's their time with the kids. The kids are upset, thinking the author is blocking them from going with their dad. The ex is using this to paint the author as the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. They have a 50/50 split, and they agreed not to plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important. The author has never switched weeks before, even if the ex asked. The ex is now asking to switch a week for the reunion, but the author says no. The ex's parents can't reschedule, and the ex claims it's the only week for the whole family.\n\nThe key points here are the custody agreement terms. If the agreement explicitly states that they don't switch weeks unless necessary, and the author has always stuck to that, then the author isn't violating the agreement. The ex is asking for a switch during the author's time, which the author isn't obligated to do. The author's reasoning is that it's their scheduled time with the kids, so they should get to use it as they see fit. The ex is trying to present the author as being unfair, but the author is following the agreed-upon schedule.\n\nThe author is also not the one who scheduled the family reunion during their week. The ex's parents arranged it, so the ex is responsible for that timing. The author isn't at fault for refusing to give up their custody time when the ex's family made plans during their week. The kids are upset because they were told the author\u4e0d\u8ba9 them go, but the author is just upholding their custody rights. The kids might not understand the situation yet, but the author isn't wrong for standing by their agreement.\n\nSo, considering the custody arrangement and the ex's role in scheduling during the author's time, the author isn't in the wrong. They are adhering to their legal agreement, and the ex is the one pushing for a change the author isn't required to make. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
