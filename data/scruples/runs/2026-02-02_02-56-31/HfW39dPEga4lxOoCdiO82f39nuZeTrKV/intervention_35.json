My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. The situation is about custody and vacation plans. The user has a 50/50 custody agreement where they alternate weeks. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's week, so they asked to switch weeks. The user refused, and now the kids and ex are upset.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement states that they don't plan things on days that aren't theirs and rarely switch. The user has followed this strictly for 8 years. The ex is asking for a switch now, but the user is standing by the agreement. Legally, if the custody agreement is clear, the user might have the right to keep their scheduled time. But the kids are upset because they want to go on the trip. The ex isn't helping by making the user look bad. \n\nThe user is firm in their stance because they believe the agreement should be respected. The ex's parents had the reunion scheduled during the user's week, so maybe the ex should have planned better. The kids are caught in the middle, which is tough, but the user is trying to explain it's their time. The user isn't giving in, which might be seen as being strict but following the rules. The ex's actions are making the user look like the villain, but the user is just enforcing the agreement. \n\nSo, legally and according to the custody terms, the user isn't in the wrong. The ex didn't plan properly and is trying to bend the rules. The user's children are upset, but that's due to the ex's manipulation. The user is standing up for their rights as per the agreement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
