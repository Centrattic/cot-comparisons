My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with the ex during their scheduled time. The situation is a 50/50 custody agreement that's been in place for 8 years. The author has always stuck to the agreement, not switching days even when asked. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refused. Now the kids are upset, thinking the author is blocking them from going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The custody agreement is a legal document. If it clearly states that each parent has the kids on specific weeks without switching unless agreed upon, then the author isn't breaking any rules. The ex's request to switch a week would be against the agreement unless both parties agree. The author has a right to their scheduled time.\n\nNext, the emotional impact on the kids. The kids are upset because they want to go to Disneyland with their dad. The ex is framing the author as the bad guy, which could be manipulative. The author is trying to explain that the custody agreement is the reason, but the kids aren't listening. The author is frustrated because they feel they're being blamed for something out of their control.\n\nThe ex's actions are problematic here. By scheduling a family event during the author's custody week without prior arrangement, he's the one who initiated the conflict. The author is just adhering to the existing agreement. The ex's refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude (\"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\") suggests he's not taking responsibility.\n\nThe kids' reactions are also influenced by their ex's framing. The son is angry, the daughter is crying. The author is caught in the middle, trying to maintain their custody rights but facing backlash from the kids. The author's firm stance is justified if the custody agreement is clear and both parties had agreed to not switch weeks unless necessary.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex is the one who tried to get a switch without prior agreement. The author is upholding the custody arrangement, which is in the best interest of maintaining stability for the kids. The kids need to understand that custody schedules exist for their well-being and that both parents need to respect them. The author's frustration is valid because they're being blamed for a situation they didn't create. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
