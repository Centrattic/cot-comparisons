My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about custody and vacation plans. The author has a 50/50 custody arrangement, and the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not cooperating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. They have a 50/50 split, so each parent has designated weeks. The ex is asking to switch weeks for a family reunion, but the author has a policy of not switching unless necessary. The author's stance is that they won't give up their time unless it's extremely important. The ex's parents can't reschedule, so the author says no. \n\nNow, the question is if the author is wrong. The key points here are the custody agreement's terms. If the agreement clearly states that they don't switch days unless it's extremely important, then the author is following the agreement. The ex is asking for a switch, but the author isn't required to give up their time. The author isn't violating any terms by refusing. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might come off as harsh. The kids are upset, and the author isn't allowing any flexibility. But if the agreement is strict and both parties agreed to it, then the author isn't in the wrong. The ex's parents' event is during the author's time, so the ex can't force a switch without mutual agreement. \n\nAlso, the author is standing by their terms, and the ex is trying to frame the author as the bad guy. The author's refusal isn't about revenge but about upholding the custody agreement. The kids are upset because they don't understand the situation, but the author is trying to explain, and the kids aren't listening. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, since the custody is already split, the parent with custody during that week has the right to decide activities unless there's a court order allowing exceptions. The author isn't violating any laws here. The ex is trying to override the custody schedule, which isn't allowed unless both agree. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're following the agreed-upon custody terms and not allowing the ex to infringe on their time without mutual agreement. The ex is at fault for trying to manipulate the situation and lying to the kids. The author's refusal is justified under the terms they both agreed to.\n"
