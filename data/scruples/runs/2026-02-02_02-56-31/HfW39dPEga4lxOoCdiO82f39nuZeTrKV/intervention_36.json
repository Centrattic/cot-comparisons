My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation involves custody, a vacation, and the kids being upset. \n\nFirst, the background: The user and their ex have a 50/50 custody arrangement that's been in place for 8 years. They agreed not to switch custody days unless it's extremely important. The user hasn't switched any time before. Now, the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's week, asking to switch weeks. The user refused, thinking it's unfair since the ex's parents scheduled it during their time. The kids are upset, thinking the user is blocking them from going, and the ex is framing it as the user being the bad guy.\n\nThe user's main argument is that they have a right to their scheduled time with the kids as per the custody agreement. The ex is trying to rearrange something during their time, which the user hasn't done before. The user's ex isn't offering an alternative time unless the parents can reschedule, but they can't. The user is standing by the original agreement and refuses to negotiate, leading to the kids being upset.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, custody agreements are legally binding, and both parties are supposed to follow them. If the ex agreed to the 50/50 split and the no-switching policy, except in extreme cases, and this isn't one, then the user is within their rights to enforce the agreement. The ex's request is outside the agreed terms, so the user isn't wrong for not complying. The kids are being manipulated by the ex into thinking the user is the villain, which is problematic. The user is justified in standing up for their time, especially since they've always honored the agreement. The ex's actions are the issue here, not the user's. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
