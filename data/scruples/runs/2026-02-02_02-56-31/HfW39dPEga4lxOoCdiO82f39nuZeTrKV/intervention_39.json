My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing their kids to go on a vacation with their ex during the parent's scheduled custody week. The situation involves a 50/50 custody arrangement, established for 8 years, with clear boundaries that they don't switch days unless necessary. The ex wanted to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's week, but the user refused. The kids are upset, blaming the parent, and the ex is using them to portray the parent as the bad guy.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement is a legal agreement they both agreed to. The user hasn't violated it by not switching weeks. The ex, however, is trying to request a change for a vacation, which the user isn't obligated to do unless there's an agreement. The user's stance is that the ex scheduled it during their time, so the fault isn't on the user's side. The kids are confused and upset because their ex has framed the parent as the one preventing the trip, which adds emotional complexity. \n\nThe user's anger is justified because the ex is breaking the prior agreement without mutual consent. The user's demand for an apology makes sense since the ex is misleading the kids. Legally, the user has the right to their scheduled time, and the ex's actions are undermining that. The kids' reactions show the emotional toll, but the parent's position is about upholding the custody terms. There's no indication the user is acting out of spite, just enforcing their rights as per the agreement. So, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
