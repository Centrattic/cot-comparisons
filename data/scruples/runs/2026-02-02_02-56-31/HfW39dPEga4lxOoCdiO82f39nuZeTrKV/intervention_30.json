My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about custody and vacation plans. The user has a 50/50 custody agreement with their ex, and the ex is trying to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's scheduled time. The user refused to switch weeks, and now their kids are upset because they think the parent is the one stopping them from going.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the custody agreement. They have a 50/50 setup where they don't plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important. The user hasn't switched any weeks in 8 years, so the ex's request might be a violation of that agreement. The ex is trying to take the kids during the user's time, which the user is entitled to. \n\nThe user didn't give in, which is their right if the agreement doesn't allow switching unless both agree. The ex's parents scheduled the trip during the user's time, so maybe the ex should have considered that earlier. But the user's stance is that they're not giving up their time. \n\nNow, the kids are upset, thinking the parent is the bad guy. The user tried to explain, but the kids aren't listening because the ex is framing it that way. The user's anger is justified because they're upholding the custody agreement. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. Could they have compromised? Like letting the kids go part of the week and the parent keep them the other part? But the user didn't mention that. They just refused entirely. Maybe that's a consideration. But given the history of not switching weeks and the ex's parents' involvement, the user might feel it's unfair to compromise. \n\nAlso, the ex's approach seems manipulative by making the kids think the parent is the one blocking the trip. That's a red flag. The user isn't in the wrong for sticking to their schedule. The ex is the one who should be held accountable for not respecting the agreement. \n\nSo, based on the custody terms and the ex's actions, the user is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
