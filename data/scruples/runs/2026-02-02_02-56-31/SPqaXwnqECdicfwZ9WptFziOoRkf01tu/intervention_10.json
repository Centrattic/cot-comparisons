I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner, along with her family, just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends just show up as surprises. The partner and her sister like it, but the user doesn't. The user explained they might have things to do or need time alone, and that the house might not be ready for unscheduled visits. Now there's a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair and the user's opinion being seen as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The user expressed their feelings about unexpected guests, which is their right. They mentioned their need for personal space and time. The partner's family seems to have different social norms, expecting to visit without notice. The user's response was about setting boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the partner is taking their side, which could be because she's used to that family dynamic. The user is now labeled as aggressive, which might be because the family isn't used to someone setting boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The user had a valid reason to not want unexpected guests. It's not wrong to have personal space needs. The issue might be how the user communicated their feelings. If they were polite and clear, they're not in the wrong. However, if they came off as abrupt, that could be seen as aggressive. The partner's family might feel their way of socializing is being criticized. The user's partner might not realize the importance of these boundaries. \n\nI think the user is justified in wanting some control over their home environment. It's a normal expectation to have some privacy and prepare for guests. The problem might stem from differing cultural or family norms. The user isn't in the wrong for having different preferences. They need to communicate better to set boundaries without making others feel their behavior is being judged. The answer here is B; the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
