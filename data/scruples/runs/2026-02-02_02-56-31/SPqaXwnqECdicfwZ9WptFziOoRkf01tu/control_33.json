I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's partner's family expecting to drop by unannounced, but the author doesn't like that.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and their partner just returned from Iceland and had a planned meal. The discussion arose about the partner's parents and friends showing up as surprises. The author expressed discomfort, stating they might be busy or need alone time. The partner's family now sees the author as being aggressive for not wanting unexpected guests.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, boundaries are a normal part of relationships. The author is asserting their need for personal space, which is valid. The partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to set boundaries. The author is sharing their feelings without being confrontational, as they mentioned not usually voicing their opinion. The partner is upset because they feel it's unfair, but the author's house is shared, so they have a right to their preferences. \n\nThe family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like a misunderstanding. Expressing a preference isn't aggression. The author isn't forbidding family time entirely but is asking for consideration. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their personal space, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
