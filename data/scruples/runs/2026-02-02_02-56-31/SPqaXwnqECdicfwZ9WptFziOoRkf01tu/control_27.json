I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a meal at a fancy restaurant. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author disagrees. The author mentioned that they don't like it because they might have things to do and sometimes need a day to themselves. They also said they wouldn't want the house to be in a mess if people show up unexpectedly. This led to a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair, and the author being labeled as \"aggressively opinionated\" by the parents.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is stating their preference about not wanting unexpected guests. It's their home as well, so they have a right to set boundaries. However, the conflict arises because the partner's family is used to surprising each other, which might be a cultural or family norm.\n\nThe author's response might be seen as assertive, but not necessarily aggressive. They're expressing their needs, which is reasonable. However, the way it was communicated could be a factor. The partner feels it's unfair because her family is doing this to her too, so maybe the author didn't consider her perspective enough. Also, the author's statement about the house being \"as much theirs as hers\" is valid, but if the partner's family is already used to visiting each other, the author's sudden resistance might not have been handled smoothly.\n\nBut from a fairness standpoint, the author isn't wrong to set boundaries in their own home. People have different comfort levels with social interactions. The issue might be more about the partner's family not respecting the author's boundaries, and the partner not mediating the situation well. The author's problem is that they didn't express their concerns earlier, leading to the conflict now. However, it's their house, so they should be able to set those rules. The parents labeling them as aggressively opinionated might be a defensive reaction from the family feeling their usual behavior is being challenged.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their preferences in their home. The wrong might lie more with the partner's family for not respecting those boundaries, but the question is specifically about the author. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
