I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just returned from a trip and planned a fancy dinner. The partner's family often drops by unannounced, which the author dislikes. The author expressed their discomfort, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's stance is reasonable. The author is part of the household, so they have a right to their own space and preferences. It's common for people to appreciate privacy and advance notice. The partner's family might see unannounced visits as friendly, but the author's perspective is valid too.\n\nThe partner is upset because they feel it's unfair their family can't just visit. The author's response was about needing personal time and not wanting the house to be messy. The family labels the author as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be a reaction to the author finally speaking up after usually holding back.\n\nI think the key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't wrong for having boundaries. The partner and her family should respect the author's space. The issue might be more about the partner not acknowledging the author's perspective. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
