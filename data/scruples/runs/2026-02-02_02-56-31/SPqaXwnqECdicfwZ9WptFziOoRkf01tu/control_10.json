I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family, who are used to showing up unannounced. The author expressed their dislike for this, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, consider boundaries. The author is part of a household, so their home should be a shared space. It's reasonable for them to want to set boundaries about who can come over without notice. The partner's family might see it as a cultural norm, but that doesn't negate the author's feelings. \n\nNext, the author's response was to explain their reasons, not attack the family. They mentioned needing personal time and the house being in order. That's legitimate. The partner's reaction seems to be about fairness, but fairness also includes respecting the author's needs. \n\nThe family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" because they stated their preferences is a bit harsh. The author didn't act out; they communicated their thoughts. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior if they're living in the same house now. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's a two-way street. The author isn't wrong for wanting boundaries. The partner and her family should also consider the author's perspective. It's about mutual respect. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their space and preferences. The conflict arises from differing expectations, not from the author being at fault. Answer B.\n"
