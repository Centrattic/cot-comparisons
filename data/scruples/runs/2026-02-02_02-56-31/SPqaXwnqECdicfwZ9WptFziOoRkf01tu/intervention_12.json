I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They had a disagreement with their partner and her family about people showing up unannounced. The partner thinks it's a nice surprise, but the user doesn't like it because they might have things to do or need alone time. The partner's family now thinks the user is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's right to their own space and boundaries is important. No one likes to have their personal time or space invaded without notice. The user is setting a boundary, which is a healthy thing. On the other hand, the partner's family has a different cultural or family norm where surprise visits are considered friendly. The user's partner is caught between these two perspectives.\n\nThe user's response was to express their discomfort, which is reasonable. The partner's family might not be used to someone setting such boundaries, so they might perceive it as being aggressive. However, the user is justified in asserting that the house is shared and they have a say in how it's used. \n\nI should check if there's any cultural context that might affect this. The user didn't mention any, so I'll assume it's a personal boundary issue. The key here is mutual respect. The user isn't in the wrong for setting their boundaries, but maybe communication could be improved. The partner needs to help her family understand the user's perspective. The user isn't being inconsiderate, just setting limits. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
