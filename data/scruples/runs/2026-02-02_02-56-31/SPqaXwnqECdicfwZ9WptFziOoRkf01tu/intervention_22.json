I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had dinner at a fancy restaurant. While there, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends drop by unannounced. The user expressed their dislike for that, saying they need days to themselves and don't want the house in disarray. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the user is labeled as aggressive.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning makes sense. People have different comfort levels with social interactions. The user is valid in wanting personal time and privacy. The partner's family might not realize the impact of their surprise visits. The user didn't act out aggressively; they just stated their feelings. The partner's family's reaction seems harsh. The user isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So, answer B.\n"
