I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They had a discussion after a trip where they expressed their dislike for surprise visits. Their partner and her family think it's a nice surprise, but the user feels it's intrusive. The user mentioned they usually hold back their opinions around the partner's family, but now they're being called aggressive.\n\nHmm. First, the user's concern is valid. People have different boundaries, and it's reasonable to want some personal space. The user explained their reasons clearly\u2014maybe having tasks to do or needing a day to themselves. They also mentioned the house being a mess, which is a practical point. \n\nThe partner's side thinks it's unfair not to let them show up. But the user's house is a shared space, so both families should respect each other's boundaries. The user hasn't been vocal before, so maybe this was a first-time expression of their feelings. Being labeled as aggressive might be a reaction from the other side not understanding the user's perspective.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. They're setting boundaries in their own home. The key here is mutual respect. The partner and her family need to adjust their expectations. The user isn't being unreasonable; they're just asserting their needs. So the answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
