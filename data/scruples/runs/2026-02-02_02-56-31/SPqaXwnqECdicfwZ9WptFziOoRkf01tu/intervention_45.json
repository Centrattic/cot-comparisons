I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner and her family are used to surprising each other, but the user feels it's intrusive. They mentioned being labeled as aggressive for expressing their opinion.\n\nFirst, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. It's clear the user isn't okay with last-minute guests, which is their right. However, the way the issue arose in the context of a meal might have contributed to the tension. The partner and her family might see it as a cultural or family norm to drop by without notice. \n\nThe user's response about needing personal time and wanting the house to be clean is reasonable. But the partner's reaction suggests she values her family's traditions more, which could create conflict. The user's partner might feel the user isn't respecting her family's habits, leading to the divide. \n\nHowever, the user's house is a shared space, so both sides need to compromise. The user isn't wrong for setting boundaries; the partner isn't wrong either for wanting her family to visit. The key issue is communication. The user might have expressed their feelings more effectively if they had discussed this earlier rather than bringing it up during a meal after a trip. \n\nThe label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a defense mechanism from the in-laws to avoid changing their behavior. The user's right to their own space isn't wrong, but they might need to navigate this more diplomatically in the future. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their stance. The answer is B.\n"
