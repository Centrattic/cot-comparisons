I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner just came back from a trip, had a nice dinner, and discussed how the partner's family visits each other without notice. The user expressed discomfort with this, explaining they need space for themselves and that the house might not be presentable. Now, there's a rift because the partner feels it's unfair, and her parents think the user is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, the user has a valid point. Everyone has different boundaries about privacy and unannounced visits. It's reasonable to want some personal time and space. The user's concern about the house not being in order is also practical. They're sharing a home, so both should respect each other's preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner and her family might see these visits as a way to stay close. However, the user's reaction isn't extreme; they're just setting boundaries. The partner's family calling them \"aggressively opinionated\" seems harsh, especially if the user usually holds back their feelings. It's about mutual respect and compromise. The user isn't wrong for setting these boundaries. They deserve to feel comfortable in their own home. So, the answer is B; they're not in the wrong.\n"
