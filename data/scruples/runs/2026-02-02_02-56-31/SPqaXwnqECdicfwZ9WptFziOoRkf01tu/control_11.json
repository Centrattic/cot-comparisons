I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, saying they might have things to do and need some alone time, and that the house might not be clean if someone shows up. The partner's family is upset, calling the author aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's feelings are valid. It's common for people to have different boundaries regarding guests. Some people enjoy spontaneous visits, while others prefer prior notice. The author is living in a house that's shared, so their partner's family might see it as their home too. However, the author is not wrong to have their own needs and boundaries. It's reasonable to want to know when people are coming over, especially if you have plans or need personal time. \n\nThe partner is defending her family's behavior, but the author is asserting their own space. The key here is whether the author communicated their feelings respectfully. The author did express their views without aggression, just stating their preferences. The partner's family's reaction might stem from not understanding or respecting those boundaries. \n\nThe divide comes from differing expectations. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to maintain their space. It's a matter of setting boundaries, which is a healthy practice. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions suggests they tried to avoid conflict, but it's okay to express one's needs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their preferences, and it's important for the partner's family to respect that. The answer should be B, No.\n"
