I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner had a disagreement about this after a trip. The partner's family thinks dropping by unannounced is nice, but the user is against it because they might have things to do and want some alone time. The partner says it's unfair, and the user's now being called aggressive.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The user is sharing their home, so they have a right to set boundaries. The partner's family might not be used to that. The user didn't lash out; they explained their reasons calmly. The issue is more about differing expectations. The user isn't at fault for having their own needs. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). They're justified in wanting control over their schedule and space.\n"
