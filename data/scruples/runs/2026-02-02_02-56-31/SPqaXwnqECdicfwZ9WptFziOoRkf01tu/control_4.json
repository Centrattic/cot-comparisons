  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For not liking unexpected guests?\nSo basically myself, my partner and her family have just gotten back from Iceland and we had pre booked a nice meal at a fancy restaurant to wrap up the holiday so to speak. \nWhilst we were there we got on to the subject of her parents and their friends just showing up at each others houses as a surprise. \n\nMy partner and her sister agreed that this is a nice surprise, I however did not. I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about unexpected guests and differing opinions on that.\n\nSo, the writer is the partner of the person whose family visits unannounced. They went on a trip with the family, returned, and had dinner. During the meal, the topic came up about the parents and their friends surprising each other. The writer's partner and her sister like these surprises, but the writer doesn't. He expressed that he's not a fan because he might have things to do or wants a day to himself, and he doesn't want to be caught off guard with the house messy. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair that the family can't just drop by, and the writer's family thinks he's being aggressive.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The writer is asserting that the house is shared, so his needs matter too. It's reasonable to want some personal space and time. The family might not be used to having someone else's preferences considered, especially if they're used to each other's company. The writer isn't being aggressive; he's setting a boundary. The partner's family might be overreacting because they're not used to having their habits challenged. The writer's point about the house being his as well is valid. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The issue is about differing expectations and communication, not the author being wrong.\n"
