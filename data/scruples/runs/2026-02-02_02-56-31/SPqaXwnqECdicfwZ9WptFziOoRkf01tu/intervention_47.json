I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner and her family just came back from a trip, and they had a fancy dinner planned. The partner's family likes showing up unannounced, which the user doesn't like. They mentioned they have things to do and want some alone time.\n\nThe partner is upset because she thinks it's unfair her family can't just drop by. The user says it's their house too. The family now thinks the user is being aggressive. The user wants to know if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. The user has a valid reason: needing personal space and not wanting to be interrupted. It's reasonable to want some privacy, especially if they have plans or need to get things done. \n\nHowever, the user might have expressed this in a way that came off as dismissive. They mentioned the house might be in a state, which could imply the guests are a burden. Maybe the user could have approached the conversation more collaboratively instead of being direct. \n\nBut the core issue is about mutual respect. The user's feelings are valid, and it's okay to set boundaries. The partner's family might not have considered the user's perspective. The user isn't being inconsiderate; they're asserting their needs. The family's reaction seems unfair, as the user is within their rights to set boundaries. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because having boundaries is reasonable, and the user explained their reasons clearly. The family's reaction might be their issue, not the user's fault.\n"
