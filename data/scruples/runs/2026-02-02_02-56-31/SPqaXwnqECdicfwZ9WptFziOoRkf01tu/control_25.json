I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends dropping by as surprises. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the author doesn't. The author explained they don't like it because they might be busy or need a day to themselves and don't want the house messy. Now, the partner says it's unfair, and the author's been labeled as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. The key points here are personal boundaries and communication. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a valid boundary. They explained their reasons: needing personal time and not wanting the house to be in disarray. The partner is upset because her family feels entitled to drop by. The author asserts that the house is also theirs, which makes sense if they're a couple living together. \n\nThe problem seems to stem from differing social norms. The partner's family might be used to unannounced visits, but the author isn't. The author tried to communicate their feelings, which is good, but the partner and in-laws are taking it as aggression. The author's stance isn't about rejecting the partner's family but about personal space and control over their home. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, setting boundaries about one's living space is reasonable. The author isn't wrong for wanting to manage their time and environment. However, the way the communication was handled might be a factor. If the author had a history of biting their tongue and then suddenly expressed their opinion, the partner's family might feel blindsided. But the author's reasons are valid. The partner's side might need to adjust, but the author isn't wrong to voice their needs. So the answer is B, No.\n"
