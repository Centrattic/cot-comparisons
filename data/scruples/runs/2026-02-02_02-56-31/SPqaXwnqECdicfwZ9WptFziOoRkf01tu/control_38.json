I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from Iceland and were discussing how the partner's parents and friends just show up unannounced. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if guests arrive unexpectedly. This led to a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair, and the author's opinions being labeled as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about personal boundaries and differing cultural or family norms. The author is asserting their right to have space and to control who comes into their home unexpectedly. The partner's family is used to a more open, surprise visit approach. The author explained their reasoning calmly, mentioning their need for personal time and not wanting the house to be in disarray when guests drop by. The partner, however, is defending her family's traditions, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. In most cases, setting boundaries in a relationship is not wrong, especially when it involves one's personal space and time. The author is in a shared home, so their partner's family might see it as part of the household. However, the author has a valid point about needing personal time and privacy. The key here is whether the author's objection is reasonable and if the way they expressed it was respectful.\n\nThe author didn't lash out but explained their perspective. The partner's family might feel disrespected because they're used to a different dynamic. However, the author isn't wrong for having boundaries. The partner might need to mediate between both families' expectations. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might be due to the partner's family not expecting the author to set such boundaries, not necessarily because the author was wrong.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs in a respectful manner. The conflict arises from differing expectations, not one side being objectively right or wrong. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
