I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner planned. During dinner, they started talking about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author says they don't like that because they might have things to do and sometimes want a day to themselves. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair that her family can't just show up whenever, and the author is saying it's their house too. The partner's family is labeling the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected guests. They mentioned having things to do and needing personal time. That's a valid reason. The partner's side sees it as a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. The author also points out that the house is theirs as much as the partner's, which is a reasonable point. The partner's family is upset because the author is sharing their opinion, which they usually don't do. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, is the author at fault? Well, the author is setting boundaries. It's common for people to have different social norms. The partner's family might be more open to spontaneous visits, while the author prefers planned interactions. The author isn't being aggressive, just stating their preferences. The partner's family might be inconsiderate if they don't respect those boundaries. The partner is caught between her family's habits and her partner's preferences. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is not doing anything harmful; they are expressing their feelings. The issue arises from differing expectations. The author isn't being aggressive; they're advocating for their needs. The partner's family's reaction could be due to not respecting the author's boundaries. The partner might be trying to please both sides, but that's a common conflict in relationships when families have different customs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their space and to express their preferences. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior, and the partner needs to mediate between both perspectives. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
