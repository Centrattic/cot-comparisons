I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They mentioned that after a trip, they and their partner's family were discussing how the parents and their friends just show up as surprises. The user didn't like that and expressed their discomfort, leading to tension with the partner and in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The user is part of a household, so their home is shared. They have a valid reason for not wanting unannounced visits\u2014they might have things to do or need personal time. It's reasonable for them to express that. People have different preferences, and it's okay to communicate your needs.\n\nThe partner's family might have different social norms. Maybe in their culture or family tradition, dropping by without notice is common. But the user's main point is that it's their home too. They're not being inconsiderate by setting boundaries. They're just stating their needs, which is healthy.\n\nThe user also mentioned they usually bite their tongue, so this was an exception. The fact that they were labeled as aggressive is a sign that their expression might have come off as harsh, but the content of their message is about their legitimate needs. The problem isn't in their opinion but possibly in how they communicated it. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for having that opinion, not the delivery.\n\nThe partner is on their side, saying it's unfair, but the user is correct in asserting their space. Shared homes require mutual respect for each other's needs. The user's stance isn't wrong; they have a right to their personal space and time. The issue is more about the partner's family adjusting to that boundary rather than the user being at fault.\n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, they're not in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries in their shared home.\n"
