I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a booked meal at a fancy restaurant. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends show up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the author doesn't like it. The author explained they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and don't want the house messy for unannounced visits. Now, the partner is upset, feeling the author is being unfair, and the partner's parents think the author is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is about personal space and boundaries. They mentioned needing time to themselves and not wanting the house to be in a state when guests come. This is a common concern, especially if someone hasn't prepared for visitors. The author's partner's family seems to view unannounced visits as a positive, but the author is setting a boundary. \n\nThe conflict arises because the partner and her family might not respect the author's need for privacy. The key here is that the author is standing up for their own space in a shared home. It's reasonable to want to control your own environment, especially after a trip where they might be tired or need to rest. The author didn't say they dislike the family, just that unexpected guests aren't their thing. \n\nThe partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like a misinterpretation. The author was stating their preference, not attacking the family. The author's partner is also caught in the middle, trying to balance both perspectives. \n\nI think the author is justified in their stance. They are asserting their right to have a home where they can have personal time and control the environment. The family's expectation of unannounced visits might be a cultural or habitual thing, but that doesn't negate the author's legitimate need for space. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
