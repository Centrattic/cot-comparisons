I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves them, their partner, and her family. They just came back from a trip and had a pre-booked meal. They mentioned to the partner and her family that they don't like surprise visits because they might need to do things or have a day to themselves. The partner's family is upset, and now there's a divide.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The user is asserting their space, which is a common issue. The partner's family is used to showing up unannounced, but the user is uncomfortable. The user's point is about respecting their own time and the state of the house. The partner is defending her family's habits, but the user is standing their ground.\n\nIs the user wrong? Well, everyone has the right to their own preferences. The user isn't being aggressive, just expressing their need for personal space. However, the partner's family might see it as being closed off. The key here is mutual respect. If the user's partner is pushing the family to accept the user's boundaries, that's fair. But the user isn't wrong for having those boundaries. The issue might be communication style\u2014maybe the user could have addressed it more gently, but their stance isn't inherently wrong.\n\nAlso, the house being shared between the partner and the user means both should have a say in who comes over. The user's concern about the house being in a state is valid too. So, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
