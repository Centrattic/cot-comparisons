I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner's family is used to dropping by unannounced, but the user finds this disruptive. They had a conversation about it after returning from a trip, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, boundaries are important in relationships. The user has a right to set them, especially in their own home. The partner's family might see their actions as normal, but others might have different comfort levels. The user expressed their feelings calmly, mentioning needing time for themselves and not wanting the house to be messy. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe partner is taking the family's side, which could be a problem. The user's home should be a shared space where both parties' needs are considered. The family labeling the user as \"aggressively opinionated\" isn't helpful. It sounds like a communication issue rather than the user being wrong. They've been holding back their opinions before, which is why this came up now. \n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. The issue might be more about the family not respecting those boundaries and the partner not mediating fairly. The answer should be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
