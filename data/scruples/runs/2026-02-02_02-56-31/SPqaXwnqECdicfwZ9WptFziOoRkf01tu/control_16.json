I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author and their partner's family had a disagreement when the author expressed discomfort with surprise visits.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they, their partner, and her family came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked meal to wrap up the trip. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister liked the surprise, but the author didn't. The author explained that they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and that the house might not be in order if guests showed up unexpectedly. This caused a divide because the partner felt it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author emphasized that the house is also theirs. The partner's parents now see the author as aggressively opinionated because they usually hold back their opinions.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider cultural norms, boundaries, and communication. Expressing a preference about having unannounced guests isn't inherently wrong. Everyone has different comfort levels. The author seems to be setting a boundary, which is reasonable. However, the partner's family might be used to a different social norm where surprise visits are common. The conflict arises because the author's views differ from their partner's family's expectations. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is asserting their own space and preferences in their home. It's reasonable to want to control who enters your home and when. The author's statement about the house being \"just as much theirs\" is valid if they are living there. The partner's family might feel they have the right to drop by because of their relationship with the partner, but the author is pushing back, which is their right. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems to be more about the conflict between the two family dynamics. The author isn't being aggressive; they're expressing a legitimate concern. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from the partner's family not being used to having their habits challenged. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for stating their preferences. The issue is more about differing expectations and the need for mutual understanding. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
