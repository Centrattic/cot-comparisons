I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner and her family consider surprise visits a nice gesture, but the user prefers privacy and time alone. They expressed their feelings, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, boundaries in relationships are important. If someone is uncomfortable with unexpected guests, it's reasonable to set that boundary. The user mentioned they usually hold back their opinions, but when they did speak up, it caused tension. \n\nThe partner's side sees it as fairness, but the user is standing up for their own needs. It's a balance between respecting family traditions and individual comfort. The user's statement about the house being as much theirs as the partner's is valid. \n\nHowever, the way the user expressed their feelings might have come off as harsh, especially since they usually don't voice their opinions. The parents labeled them as aggressively opinionated, which suggests communication could be an issue. \n\nBut the core issue is about personal space versus family customs. There's no inherent right or wrong here; it's more about mutual respect and finding a compromise. The user isn't in the wrong for asserting their needs, but maybe they need to communicate more effectively.\n"
