I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that they and their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, the partner and her sister mentioned that their parents and friends sometimes show up unannounced as a surprise. The person expressed that they don't like that because they might have things to do or want a day to themselves, and also mentioned the house state. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the parents labeled the person as aggressively opinionated.\n\nHmm. The user is asking if they are at fault. Let me break it down. First, the person is living in a house that they consider as much theirs as their partner's. Communicating boundaries about unannounced visits is a reasonable thing to do, especially if it's important to them. They did express their feelings calmly, pointing out their reasons. The partner and her family seem to have different expectations here. The partner might be caught between her family's habits and her partner's preferences. The person isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs. The family's reaction seems harsh because they didn't take the time to understand the other person's perspective. \n\nWait, but maybe the issue is that the person didn't communicate this before, so the family might feel it's a sudden change. But the person mentioned that they usually bite their tongue around the family. So maybe they've had this issue before but didn't voice it until now. However, in relationships, it's important to communicate needs, even if it's not comfortable. The person is in their right to express their boundaries, especially regarding their own home. The family might need to adjust their behavior if it's causing conflict. So I think the person isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
