I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland. They had a fancy restaurant booked to wrap up the trip. During the meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and their friends showing up at each other's houses as a surprise. The partner and sister like it, but the user doesn't. The user explained that they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do or need alone time, and also mentioned the house might not be in order. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the user's stance led to being labeled as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They have a right to their personal space and time. It's reasonable to not want unexpected visitors, especially after a trip where they might need rest or want to prepare the house. They expressed their feelings calmly, explaining their reasons. It seems like they're setting boundaries, which is healthy in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner and her family see surprise visits as a positive, a way to connect. The user's partner is upset that the user doesn't support this, thinking it's unfair. The user's response about the house being their shared home is valid because it's a joint space. The problem here is a difference in expectations and communication styles. The user might not have been aggressive, just stating their needs, but the partner's family might not be used to such boundaries.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Probably not. It's their right to have personal space. The issue is more about differing views and the partner's family not respecting that boundary. The user isn't being inconsiderate; they're advocating for their needs. The partner needs to understand that mutual respect includes honoring each other's preferences. So the answer is B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's more to consider? Did the user overstep? If they had a prior discussion before the trip about this, maybe, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The user's comments were about expressing their feelings, not acting out, so they aren't at fault.\n"
