I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They came back from Iceland, had a planned meal, and discussed the partner's family's habit of showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author is sharing their own feelings about needing personal space and time, which is valid. They mentioned that the house is shared, so their input on who can come over and when should be respected. The partner's family might see it as a cultural or habitual thing, but the author has a right to set boundaries. \n\nThe partner is upset that the author didn't like the surprise visits, but the author is standing their ground. The key here is mutual respect in a relationship. Both sides need to listen to each other's perspectives. The author isn't being aggressive; they're communicating their needs. The family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a reaction to the author finally speaking up after usually holding back. \n\nSo, considering that the author has legitimate reasons and is asserting their right to personal space, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
