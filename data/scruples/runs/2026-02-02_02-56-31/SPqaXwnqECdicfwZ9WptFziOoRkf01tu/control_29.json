I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is at fault. The scenario is about unexpected guests. The person, their partner, and the partner's family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like the idea, but the person doesn't. They explained they don't like it because they might have things to do and want some alone time, and also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people show up without notice.\n\nNow, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair to restrict her family from dropping by. The person argues that the house is shared, hence the right to privacy and space. The partner's family is labeling the person as aggressively opinionated. The question is whether the person is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The person's objection is about personal space and time. They didn't just lash out but explained their reasoning. They also mentioned not usually sharing opinions, so this might be the first time they addressed it. The partner's side views this as unfair, maybe because they're used to a certain way of handling family interactions. The partner's family's reaction seems harsh, labeling the person negatively.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about boundaries. It's reasonable for the person to set boundaries in their own home, especially if they co-own or live there. The partner's family might not respect that boundary, but the person's stance is valid. They didn't attack the family, just stated their needs. So, the person isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
