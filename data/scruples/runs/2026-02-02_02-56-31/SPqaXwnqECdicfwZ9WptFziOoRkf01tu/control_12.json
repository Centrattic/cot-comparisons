I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The person (author) doesn't like it when their partner's parents and friends drop by unannounced. They had a fancy dinner after a trip, discussed it, and the author expressed their dislike. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks the family shouldn't be restricted, and the author is seen as being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is sharing a house, so they have a right to their own space. Expressing that they don't like unannounced visits isn't unreasonable. People have different social norms; some enjoy spontaneity, others need privacy. The author's concern about needing time to themselves and the house being in order is valid. However, the partner and her family might see it as a cultural or habitual thing. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is standing up for their own space. It's their home too, so they should have a say. The partner's family labeling them as aggressive might be a misunderstanding, but the author's response was about setting boundaries, which is healthy. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings. They just need to communicate better with the partner to find a balance. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
