I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner and her family are used to showing up unannounced, which the user finds inconvenient because they might have plans or need alone time. The user expressed their dislike once, explaining their reasons, and now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, the user's perspective: They value their personal space and time, which is a common need. They mentioned that they usually hold back their opinions but this time they spoke up because it's their house too. The partner's family is upset, labeling the user as \"aggressively opinionated.\" The partner is also upset, thinking it's unfair that her family can't just drop by.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the user has a right to their own space. When you live with someone's family, especially in their home, boundaries are important. The user isn't trying to be mean; they're advocating for their needs. The partner's family might be used to a different social norm where unannounced visits are common, but that doesn't mean the user is wrong to set their own boundaries. The key point is that the user communicated their feelings calmly and gave valid reasons. The partners and family might need to adjust their expectations since it's a shared living space. The user isn't being aggressive; they're expressing a legitimate need. So, I think the user is not in the wrong here.\n"
