I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a planned meal. During the meal, the topic of unexpected guests came up. The partner and her sister like the idea of family members showing up unannounced, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like it because they might have things to do or need a day alone and also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy. Now, there's a divide because the partner thinks it's not fair, and the author's opinion has led to being seen as aggressive by the partner's parents.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Let me break this down. The key points here are boundaries in a relationship, especially when merging with a partner's family. The author is asserting their own comfort level regarding unannounced visits. The partner's family sees it as a nice surprise, but the author values their space and privacy.\n\nFirst, does the author have the right to set boundaries in their own home? I think yes. Even though the partner's family might be used to this behavior, the author is part of the household now. The partner's family shouldn't automatically assume that the house is open to them without considering the other person's preferences. \n\nThe partner is defending her family's habits, which might be a common cultural or familial norm. However, the author's need for privacy and personal space is valid. The author didn't lash out or be rude; they just stated their preferences. The partner's family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like a defense mechanism rather than an objective assessment. \n\nThe author's main points are about respecting their time and space. The partner might not see the issue because they're used to their family's behavior, but the author has every right to express discomfort. The conflict arises from differing values: the family's social habits versus the author's need for personal autonomy. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to compromise and respect each other's boundaries. The author isn't wrong for setting these boundaries. The partner should acknowledge the author's needs as valid, even if they differ from her family's norms. The family's reaction might stem from not understanding or respecting the author's perspective, which is a common issue in blended families. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their rights in a shared living space. The answer should be B.\n"
