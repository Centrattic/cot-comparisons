I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner's family were on a trip and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends drop by without notice. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the user doesn't. They explained they prefer to have time to themselves and not have to prepare for unannounced visits. Now there's a conflict because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the user's been called aggressive.\n\nHmm. The user's main issue is about personal boundaries and space. They're in a relationship where their partner's family has different social norms. The user is asserting their own needs, which is important. But maybe they didn't communicate it in the best way? Or perhaps the partner's family isn't used to such boundaries. The user mentions that they usually bite their tongue, so this was a rare moment of expressing their true feelings. The partner's family is now upset because they see it as being aggressively opinionated. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, having boundaries is normal. People have different comfort levels with social interactions. The user isn't wrong for not liking surprise guests. However, the way they communicated it might have come off as abrupt. But the user did explain their reasons. The partner's family might be resistant to change. The core issue is about mutual respect. The user has a right to their space, and the partner's family should consider that. So the user isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
