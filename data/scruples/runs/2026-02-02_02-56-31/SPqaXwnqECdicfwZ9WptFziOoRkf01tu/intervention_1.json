I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is at fault here. So the situation is that they, their partner, and her family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The person in question doesn't like that and expressed their discomfort, saying they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The partner and her family think it's a nice surprise, but the person is against it. Now there's a conflict because the partner and family are upset, labeling the person as aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about boundaries and communication. The person is setting a boundary by stating they don't like unexpected guests. That's a common issue in relationships, especially when merging with a partner's family. The person's argument is about needing personal space and not wanting to be disrupted, which is a valid need. However, the partner's side is used to a different way of socializing, where showing up unannounced is seen as friendly.\n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. Let's break it down. They expressed their opinion, which is their right. They explained their reasons\u2014personal space, needing to do things, not wanting the house to be in disarray. Those reasons are legitimate. The partner's family, on the other hand, might feel that their traditions or social norms are being challenged. But the house is shared, so the person's perspective that it's \"just as much their house\" is valid. \n\nHowever, the way the person communicated their feelings might have been a factor. The partner felt it was unfair, and the family labeled them as aggressive. The person mentioned they usually \"bite their tongue,\" which suggests that they haven't communicated their preferences before. Now, when they finally do express their opinion, it comes across as a sudden shift, possibly without prior discussion. That could explain the family's reaction. \n\nBut the core issue is about mutual respect. Both sides need to respect each other's needs. The person isn't wrong for having a different preference. The partner and family might not have considered the other person's perspective before. The problem here is more about the partner and family not being open to different social norms rather than the person being at fault. \n\nSo, in terms of fault, it's more about a clash of expectations. The person isn't wrong for setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance. Did they communicate this in a respectful way? The user said they \"just said\" their opinion and finished with the house being in a state. Maybe the tone or the way it was said could have been improved. However, the partner's family's reaction of calling them aggressively opinionated seems a bit harsh. The person is justified in their stance, even if the delivery could have been smoother. So overall, the answer is B.\n"
