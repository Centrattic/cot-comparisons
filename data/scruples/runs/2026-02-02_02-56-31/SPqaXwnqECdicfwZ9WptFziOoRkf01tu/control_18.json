I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for not liking unexpected guests, especially after a trip. They mentioned their partner's family and parents just showing up unannounced, and they expressed their dislike for that. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author is against it because they might have things to do or need alone time. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's being called aggressive.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider boundaries. The author is in a relationship, so they live with their partner's family. It's their home too, so they have a right to set boundaries about who enters their space. Expressing that they don't like unexpected guests is valid. People have different preferences; some enjoy spontaneity, others need control. The key here is that the author communicated their feelings, which is important. The partner and family might not understand or respect that boundary, but the author isn't wrong for having it. The divide seems more like a conflict in expectations rather than the author being at fault. The partner's family labeling them as aggressive is probably a reaction to the author finally speaking up after usually biting their tongue. That suggests the author's stance is reasonable but perhaps the partner and family aren't respecting their needs. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
