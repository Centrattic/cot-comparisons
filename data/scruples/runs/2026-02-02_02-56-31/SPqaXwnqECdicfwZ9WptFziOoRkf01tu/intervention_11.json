I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had dinner. They mentioned being upset about the family showing up unannounced. The partner thinks it's nice, but the user doesn't like it because they need personal space and time to themselves. The user also mentioned the house state if someone shows up without notice. Now there's a divide, and the partner's family is labeling the user as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. When you're in a relationship, especially with a partner who has a close family, setting boundaries is important. The user is expressing their discomfort with surprise visits, which is a valid personal space issue. The partner's family might not realize that unexpected guests can disrupt someone's routine or peace.\n\nThe user's argument is that the house is shared, so the family shouldn't just show up. That makes sense because it's about mutual respect. However, the user admitted to usually biting their tongue, so maybe the way they expressed their opinion wasn't the issue. But when they finally spoke up, the family took it as aggression. That suggests a communication problem on both sides.\n\nThe partner is defending her family's habits, which might not consider the user's perspective. The user has the right to their own space, but perhaps the way they communicated their feelings could have been more constructive. However, the main issue here is the expectation of others coming unannounced without considering the user's needs. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for having this preference. It's about mutual respect. The family needs to understand that the user's home is a shared space and that unexpected visits aren't respectful of everyone's time and space. The user's stance is reasonable, and the family's reaction is a misinterpretation of their right to express their preferences. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
