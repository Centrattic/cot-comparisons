I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. So, the situation is after a trip, they and their partner and her family were talking about how the parents and friends just show up unannounced. The user expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and they don't want the house to be messy if someone drops by. Now, the partner and her family are upset, saying it's not fair, and the user is being called aggressive for usually holding back their opinions.\n\nHmm. First, boundaries are important in any relationship. The user is stating their preference, which is valid. It's reasonable for someone to want control over their personal space and time. The partner's family might be used to a different social norm where surprise visits are common, but that doesn't mean the user's feelings are invalid. The user clarified that this is their house too, which is a key point. Sharing a home means both parties should respect each other's needs. The user isn't being aggressive; they're voicing a legitimate concern. The partner and family might not be respecting the user's boundaries, leading to the conflict. The user probably should have communicated this earlier, but it's not too late to address it. So, the answer here is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
