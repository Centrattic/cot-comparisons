I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner, plus her family, just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. The partner's family often shows up unannounced, which the user isn't a fan of. They expressed this, and now there's tension because the partner thinks it's unfair and the user's labeled as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The user's home is a shared space, so they have a right to set boundaries. Unexpected guests can disrupt plans, and the user mentioned they might need alone time or to get things done. That's valid. The partner's family might see it as a cultural norm or friendly gesture, but the user's discomfort is real.\n\nCommunication is key here. The user did express their feelings, which is good. The partner's reaction suggests maybe they didn't expect this stance. The user isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs. The partner's family's reaction to the user's honesty might stem from not being used to such feedback. \n\nIt's a common issue in blended families or relationships. The user isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, it's important to navigate this without being hostile. Maybe a compromise could work, like giving some notice or respecting certain times when guests aren't welcome. \n\nThe user's main point is about mutual respect for the home they share. They're not being unreasonable. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
