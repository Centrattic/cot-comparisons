  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For not liking unexpected guests?\nSo basically myself, my partner and her family have just gotten back from Iceland and we had pre booked a nice meal at a fancy restaurant to wrap up the holiday so to speak. \nWhilst we were there we got on to the subject of her parents and their friends just showing up at each others houses as a surprise. \n\nMy partner and her sister agreed that this is a nice surprise, I however did not. I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They're part of a couple where the partner's family often shows up unannounced. The user expressed their discomfort after a trip, leading to tension.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user's home is a shared space, and they have legitimate reasons for wanting some privacy. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially if they have personal tasks or need alone time. The partner's family might see it as a nice surprise, but respecting someone's space is important in any relationship. The user didn't want to cause conflict before, but standing up for their space isn't aggressive\u2014it's asserting boundaries. The partner and family's reaction seems to stem from not considering the user's perspective. Since homes are shared, both sides need to compromise. The user isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs.\n"
