I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that they and their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a planned dinner. During the meal, they talked about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The user expressed that they don't like these surprises because they might have things to do and want some alone time. They also mentioned the house might not be clean if people come unannounced.\n\nThe partner is upset, saying it's unfair to her family, and the user is now labeled as aggressive by the partner's parents. The user is feeling caught between their own preferences and their partner's family traditions. \n\nFirst, the user is in a committed relationship, so they have the right to set boundaries in their shared home. It's reasonable to want some privacy and not have unannounced guests, especially if they have personal time or need to manage the house. The user communicated their feelings calmly, not aggressively. The partner and her family are taking it as a problem, but the user's stance is valid. \n\nThe partner's family's expectation to drop by might be a cultural or family norm, but that doesn't override the user's right to their space. The user isn't being inconsiderate; they're expressing their need for personal time and house management. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The user isn't at fault here because they're standing up for their own needs without being hostile. The answer should be B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
