I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their partner, along with her family, returned from Iceland. They had a pre-booked fancy dinner to wrap up the trip. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author disagrees, explaining they might need to do things or have a day to themselves. The author also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people show up. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair the family can't show up whenever. The author's response is that the house is as much theirs as the partner's. The family labels the author as aggressive for sharing their opinion.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to analyze boundaries and communication. The author is expressing their discomfort with unsolicited guests. They have a valid point about personal space and needing time to themselves. However, the partner's family sees it as a social norm or a nice gesture. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The author's statement about the house being theirs too is reasonable because if they're in a committed relationship, the home should be a shared space with mutual respect. \n\nThe partner's family's reaction seems to be about their own habits being challenged. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs. The key is whether setting boundaries in a shared living space is reasonable. Most people would agree that it's okay to have boundaries. The partner might need to mediate between her family's habits and her partner's needs. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're asserting their right to personal space and setting boundaries in their shared home. The partner and her family need to adjust their expectations.\n"
