I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is about the author's partner's family frequently showing up unannounced, and the author expressing discomfort with this. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The partner's family and partner see these surprise visits as nice, but the author doesn't. The author mentioned wanting personal time and not wanting to find the house messy. The partner is upset that the author didn't like it, and the in-laws think the author is being aggressive.\n\nThe key points are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author is setting a boundary about their space and preferences. It's common for people to have different social norms. The partner's family might be more laid-back about visiting, but the author's house is a shared space. The author isn't wrong for wanting to have control over their own home and time. \n\nHowever, the way the author expressed their feelings might have been a factor. The partner feels it's unfair, so communication style could matter. But the core issue is about differing expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for having their own preferences. The partner's family might need to adjust, just as the author is adjusting by biting their tongue usually. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have the right to set boundaries in their home. The conflict arises from differing values, but that doesn't make the author wrong. They're advocating for their needs, which is valid.\n"
