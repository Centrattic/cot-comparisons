I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests, leading to a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author, their partner, and her family returned from Iceland and had a planned meal. During the conversation, the family discusses showing up unannounced at each other's houses. The partner and sister see it as a nice surprise, but the author disagrees, explaining they need alone time and don't want the house unprepared. This caused a divide, with the partner arguing the family should be able to drop by, and the author feeling it's their house too. The partner's family labels the author as aggressive for sharing their opinion.\n\nNow, analyzing from a right or wrong perspective. The key points are boundaries and mutual respect. The author has the right to set personal boundaries regarding their time and space, especially in their own home. Expressing discomfort with unscheduled visits is reasonable. The partner's family's reaction seems to stem from not respecting those boundaries, considering the house is shared. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're advocating for their needs. The partner's family's label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a deflection if they feel their own norms are being challenged. The author isn't in the wrong for stating their preferences, especially since they usually hold back but now feel the need to communicate their feelings. The conflict arises more from the family's resistance to changing their behavior than the author's stance. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
