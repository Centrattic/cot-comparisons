I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests after a trip. They and their partner had a meal to wrap up their vacation, and the conversation turned to the partner's family showing up unannounced. The user expressed discomfort with that, saying they need alone time and might have things to do. Now, there's a divide because the partner thinks the family should be able to drop by anytime, and the user's being called aggressive for not biting their tongue.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The user is sharing their feelings about uninvited guests, which is a valid concern. People have different boundaries, and it's reasonable to want privacy. The partner's family might have a different cultural norm or just not consider others' needs. The user's partner is taking their side against the user, which complicates things.\n\nThe user's statement about the house being theirs too is important. If they're a cohabitant, they should have a say in who enters their space. The partner's parents disliking the user's honesty could be because they're used to being accommodated, not having their behavior questioned. But it's not the user's fault for setting boundaries. They didn't do anything wrong by expressing their needs. The issue is more about differing expectations and the partner's family not respecting those boundaries. So the answer should be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
