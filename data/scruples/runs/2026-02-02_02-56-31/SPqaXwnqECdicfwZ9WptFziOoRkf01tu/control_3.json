I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author's partner's family often drops by without notice, and the author expressed that they don't like it because it disrupts their time and they might have things to do. The partner is now upset, saying it's unfair, and the author's partner's family thinks the author is being too aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is part of a household they share with their partner. If the partner's family is coming over uninvited, that's a boundary issue. The author has a right to their personal space and time. They didn't just reject the idea of unexpected guests generally; they explained their reasons, which are valid\u2014maybe they need to work, rest, or just have some alone time.\n\nThe partner's family has a cultural or personal habit of dropping by, but that shouldn't override the author's comfort. The key point is that the author communicated their feelings, which shows they tried to be considerate. The partner is now taking it as something unfair, but the author's stance is about mutual respect in the shared living space. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. The family's reaction seems to be about their own habits being challenged, not the author's being in the wrong. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
