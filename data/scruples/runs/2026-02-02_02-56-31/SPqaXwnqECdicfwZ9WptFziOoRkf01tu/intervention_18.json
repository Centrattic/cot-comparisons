I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that after a trip, they and their partner's family discussed showing up unannounced. The user expressed discomfort, explaining they need time to themselves and don't want the house in disarray. Now, there's a conflict because the partner's family feels it's unfair, and the user is seen as aggressive.\n\nFirst, boundaries are important in relationships. The user is setting a personal boundary about uninvited guests, which is reasonable. People have different needs for personal space. The partner's family might not realize that the user values privacy and planning. The user's response was direct but not hostile\u2014just stating their needs. The partner's family's reaction seems to stem from not respecting those boundaries. The user's partner is caught between her family's habits and her partner's preferences. The user's actions don't seem wrong; they're advocating for their needs. The family's assumption that their way is the only way is the issue here. So, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
