  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For not liking unexpected guests?\nSo basically myself, my partner and her family have just gotten back from Iceland and we had pre booked a nice meal at a fancy restaurant to wrap up the holiday so to speak. \nWhilst we were there we got on to the subject of her parents and their friends just showing up at each others houses as a surprise. \n\nMy partner and her sister agreed that this is a nice surprise, I however did not. I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner and her family think it's nice to drop by as a surprise, but the user prefers some alone time and doesn't like the idea of the house being messy. The partner is upset because the user expressed this view, and now the user is being seen as aggressive.\n\nFirst, boundaries in a relationship are important. The user is setting their limits, which is totally valid. Everyone has different needs for personal space. The partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the user is wrong to voice their preference. \n\nThe user mentioned that they usually hold back their opinions but now expressed them, leading to conflict. However, communication is key in any relationship. If the user is part of the household, they have a right to their space. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling that their family's traditions are being challenged, but the user isn't being unreasonable\u2014just expressing their needs.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and understanding. The user isn't wrong for wanting privacy; it's about finding a middle ground. The partner and her family need to respect the user's boundaries as well. The user isn't being aggressive, just honest. So, the answer should be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
