I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They had a disagreement with their partner and her family over unannounced visits. The partner's family sees it as a nice surprise, but the user isn't a fan because they need personal time and don't want to be interrupted. The user said they don't want the house in disarray if people drop by, and now there's a divide. The partner says it's unfair, and the user is being called aggressively opinionated.\n\nHmm, first, the user's partner's family has a cultural or personal norm of showing up unannounced. That's their way of being friendly. But the user has different boundaries. They communicated their discomfort, which is valid. People do need personal space. The user isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The partner's family might not understand, but that doesn't make the user wrong. The user is in a shared living situation, so their input matters. The partner should consider both perspectives. The user's being called aggressive might be because they finally expressed their feelings, but they didn't do it in a hostile way. They just stated their needs. So, I think the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their space and to express that.\n"
