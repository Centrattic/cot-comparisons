I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They had a disagreement with their partner and her family about surprise visits. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the user prefers privacy and having days to themselves without interruptions.\n\nFirst, the user's stance isn't unreasonable. Everyone has different boundaries regarding their personal space. The fact that they mentioned they have things to do or need alone time makes sense. The partner's family might not realize the impact of showing up unannounced, especially if they're used to doing it. \n\nThe user mentioned they usually don't voice their opinions around the partner's family, which suggests they've been trying to avoid conflict. Now that they did express their feelings, the family reacted negatively, calling them \"aggressively opinionated.\" That seems like a misinterpretation. Expressing a preference isn't aggression, especially when done respectfully, as the user did by explaining their reasons.\n\nThe partner is defending her family, but that doesn't mean the user is wrong. It's important for the partner to understand that the user's home is shared, so mutual respect for each other's boundaries is necessary. The user is standing up for their space, which is a valid thing to do. The family's reaction might stem from not understanding the user's perspective or feeling that their traditions are being challenged. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user did communicate their feelings, albeit after some time. The partner's family's labeling the user as \"aggressively opinionated\" doesn't seem fair, as the user's comments were about their personal preferences, not attacking the family's habits. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their personal space and expressing that shouldn't be seen as aggressive. The issue might be more about the family's lack of understanding rather than the user's fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
