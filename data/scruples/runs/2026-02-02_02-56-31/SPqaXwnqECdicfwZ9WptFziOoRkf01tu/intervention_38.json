I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. So, the situation is that they, their partner, and her family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister like these surprises, but the user doesn't. The user explained they might have things to do or need alone time, and that the house might not be ready for unannounced visits. Now the partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the user's opinion has caused a divide.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. It's reasonable for someone to want alone time or to have control over their schedule and home environment. The user is expressing their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a valid personal boundary. They mentioned that they usually hold back their opinions around the partner's family, so this time they spoke up, leading to being labeled as aggressive. That's a problem because setting boundaries shouldn't be seen as aggression, especially in a shared living space.\n\nOn the partner's side, she might feel that the sudden change in her family's behavior is unreasonable. If her family is used to dropping by without notice, it's understandable she might see it as part of her culture or family dynamics. However, the user is now part of the household, so their input is important. The key here is mutual respect. The user isn't wrong for having their own needs, and the partner's family shouldn't feel they can impose without consideration.\n\nThe user hasn't done anything objectively wrong. They expressed their feelings calmly, pointing out their reasons. The issue arises from differing expectations and the partner's family not respecting those boundaries. The user's house is a shared space, so both parties need to find a middle ground. The user isn't at fault for asserting their needs, so the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). The problem lies more with how the partner and her family are reacting to the user's valid concerns.\n"
