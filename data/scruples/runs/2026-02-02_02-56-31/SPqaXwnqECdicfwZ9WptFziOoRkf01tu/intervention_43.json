I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They came back from Iceland, had a fancy dinner, and the topic came up about surprise visits. The partner and her sister like the idea, but the user doesn't. They mentioned needing time to themselves and not wanting the house to be messy if people show up unannounced. Now the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the user is being called aggressively opinionated by the partner's parents.\n\nHmm, the user's reasoning is about personal space and boundaries. They usually hold back their opinions but spoke up here. The partner's family might not be used to someone setting such boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. It's not about right or wrong, but about mutual understanding. The user isn't wrong for having preferences. However, the way they expressed it could have been a problem. They said they usually bite their tongue, so maybe this time they were more direct. The partner's family might feel disrespected because their traditions are being challenged.\n\nBut the user's house is shared, so they have the right to set boundaries. The issue is that the partner is taking it personally. The user isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs. The real problem might be the lack of prior discussion on this topic. The partner's family's reaction suggests they might not be used to someone asserting their space, which is a common issue in blended families or when integrating different family norms.\n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong. They have the right to their preferences, but maybe could work on communication to bridge the gap with their partner's family. However, the core of the issue is their right to set boundaries in their shared home.\n"
