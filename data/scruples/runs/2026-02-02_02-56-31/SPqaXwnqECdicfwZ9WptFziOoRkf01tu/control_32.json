I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from a trip. They had a nice restaurant booked. The discussion came up about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and also mentioned the house being in order. The partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's house is now in question. The family labels the author as aggressively opinionated despite usually holding back their opinions.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms. In some cultures, surprise visits are common and seen as friendly. However, the author's stance is about personal space and boundaries. The author shared their feelings calmly, not in anger, just stating their preference. The partner's family might not have considered the author's need for personal time and privacy. The author is part of the household, so it's reasonable they have a say in house rules. The conflict arose from differing expectations, not necessarily from the author being wrong. The partner's family's reaction seems dismissive of the author's valid concerns. So, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially in their own home. They expressed their opinion without being aggressive, so labeling them as such is unfair. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
