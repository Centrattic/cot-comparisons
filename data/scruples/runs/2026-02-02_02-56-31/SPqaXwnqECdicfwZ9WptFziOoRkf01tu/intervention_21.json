  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For not liking unexpected guests?\nSo basically myself, my partner and her family have just gotten back from Iceland and we had pre booked a nice meal at a fancy restaurant to wrap up the holiday so to speak. \nWhilst we were there we got on to the subject of her parents and their friends just showing up at each others houses as a surprise. \n\nMy partner and her sister agreed that this is a nice surprise, I however did not. I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They had a disagreement with their partner's family about showing up unannounced. The partner and her family think it's a nice surprise, but the user doesn't like it because they might have things to do or need alone time. The user mentioned their house might not be clean, which is another point. The partner is upset that they're not allowing family to drop by, and the user's been labeled as aggressive for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. It's common for people to have different preferences about unannounced visits. The user has a right to their space and privacy. The partner's family might not realize that their actions are infringing on the user's space. The user did express their feelings calmly, so being called aggressive might be a misunderstanding. It's important to establish boundaries in a relationship, especially when it involves extended family. The user isn't wrong for having these boundaries. The partner might need to mediate to find a balance between family traditions and the user's needs. So the answer should be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
