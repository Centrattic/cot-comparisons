I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So the situation is about unexpected guests. The author and their partner, along with her family, just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends drop by each other's houses as a surprise. The author didn't like that idea, explaining they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and that the house might not be clean if people show up unannounced. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks it's not fair to restrict her family, and the author is accused of being aggressive.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are about boundaries and expectations. The author is expressing a preference for not having unexpected guests, which is a valid personal boundary. They mentioned that they usually hold back their opinions around the partner's family but now shared their feelings, leading to conflict.\n\nIn relationships, especially with family involved, different people have different norms. The partner's side seems to value spontaneous visits, while the author prefers privacy. The author's house is jointly theirs, so they have a right to set rules about visitors. The partner and family might not realize how intrusive this is for the author. The author's response was to express their discomfort, which is reasonable. Being called aggressive is a possible reaction when opinions differ, but the author isn't wrong for stating their needs. \n\nSo in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their personal space and boundaries, which is important in a relationship. The partner and family need to adjust their expectations to respect the author's preferences. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
