I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They went on a trip, came back, had a fancy dinner, and discussed how the partner's family just shows up unannounced. The user expressed their discomfort with that, saying they need time to themselves and don't want the house in disarray. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the user is being called aggressive.\n\nHmm, the user's main point is about personal space and boundaries. It's common for people to have different expectations when it comes to guests. The user is in a house that's shared with their partner, so they should have a say in who comes over and when. The partner's family might not realize that the user isn't part of their usual social circle, so the user's right to set boundaries makes sense. The partner's family labeling the user as aggressive seems unfair because they were just expressing their preference. The user hasn't done anything wrong by setting limits. So the answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
