I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. So the situation is that they, their partner, and her family just returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced was discussed. The partner and her sister thought it's a nice surprise, but the user didn't. They expressed that they don't like it because they might have other plans or need personal time and that the house might not be ready for visitors.\n\nNow, the partner is saying it's not fair that her family can't just drop by, and the user is asserting that the house is as much theirs as it is the partner's. The family is calling the user aggressive for expressing their opinion, which they usually don't do around the partner's family.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, boundaries in relationships are important. The user is setting a boundary about not wanting unexpected guests, which is their right. The partner's family has their own habits, but the user is part of the household now, so they should have a say. The user's explanation seems reasonable\u2014personal space, needing time alone, and the state of the house. The partner's family might not like the boundary, but that doesn't make the user wrong. The user's approach was to calmly state their feelings, not to attack. The family's reaction seems more about not wanting to change their behavior. So, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
