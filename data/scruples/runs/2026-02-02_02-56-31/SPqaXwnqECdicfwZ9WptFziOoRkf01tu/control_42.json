I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests causing a conflict between the author and their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they don't like it because they might have things to do or need alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy for unexpected visitors. The partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author is now being seen as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nSo, the key points here are boundaries and communication. The author is asserting their personal space and time, which is a valid need. Everyone has the right to set boundaries in their home. However, the partner and her family are used to a different social norm where surprise visits are seen as friendly. The conflict arises because the author is now stating their position clearly, which the partner's family might not be used to.\n\nThe author's statement about the house being \"just as much theirs as hers\" is important. It's about ownership and shared space. If the author is a cohabitant, they definitely have a right to set rules about visitors. The issue here isn't the author's stance but how the partner and her family are reacting. The author previously held back their opinions, so this might be the first time they've spoken up, leading to the current conflict.\n\nThe partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems dismissive. The author is simply expressing their needs, which isn't aggression but setting boundaries. The partner's side might not have respected those boundaries before, and now the author is asserting them, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to want personal space and control over their home environment. The conflict stems from differing expectations and the partner's family not respecting those boundaries now that they're known. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
