I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The user expressed discomfort with that, saying they might have things to do and need some alone time, also mentioning the house state. Now the partner and her family are upset, with the partner saying it's not fair, and the parents think the user is too aggressive.\n\nFirst, the user is part of a relationship where they cohabit, so the house is shared. The user's perspective is about personal space and boundaries. They didn't like surprises because they might need to work or rest. The partner's family is used to surprise visits, which is a cultural or family norm. \n\nThe user's response was to voice their opinion, which led to conflict. They mention they usually hold back their opinions around the partner's family, but this time they didn't. The partner is upset because it's about fairness, and the family feels the user is being aggressive.\n\nSo, the key points are: shared house, differing expectations on social boundaries, communication style. The user's stance is about their right to have their space and control the household, which makes sense. However, the partner's family might see this as being too rigid or not accommodating their traditions.\n\nThe user isn't wrong for having their own needs and setting boundaries. It's reasonable to expect that others respect your living space. The issue might be in how it was communicated, but the user's reasons are valid. The partner and family might not be considering the user's perspective, or there's a cultural difference in how social visits are handled. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user should have expressed their feelings respectfully, perhaps earlier, to avoid this situation. However, the user isn't at fault for expressing their discomfort. The partner's family's reaction might stem from not understanding the user's perspective. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries in their shared home. The conflict arises from differing expectations, not the user being in the wrong.\n"
