I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests showing up at their house. The author's partner and her family think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they want some alone time and to not have to worry about the house being messy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author and partner are sharing a house, so the author's house is also their home. The author is expressing discomfort with unannounced visits, which is a valid concern. People have different social boundaries. The partner's family might have different cultural or family norms where showing up without notice is common. However, the author has a right to their personal space and privacy.\n\nThe partner is taking the side of her family, saying it's unfair for the author to object. The author is standing their ground, emphasizing that the house is shared and they should respect each other's preferences. The author hasn't been vocal about their feelings before, which might have led to this conflict. Now, the partner's family labels the author as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which suggests they might feel their traditions are being challenged.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's about mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for having different boundaries. However, maybe communication could have been better. The author did express their feelings, but perhaps the partner's family isn't used to such directness. It's possible that the partner's family's actions are intrusive, and the author is justified in setting boundaries. The key here is whether the author's concern is reasonable. Since they're living together, the author's need for personal space is valid. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations if the author isn't comfortable with their visiting habits. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're asserting their own needs in a shared living situation.\n"
