I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and her family. They returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked meal. The discussion came up about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort, mentioning needing personal time and not wanting the house to be messy. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author's opinion is seen as aggressive.\n\nFirst, the author's right to privacy and personal space. It's reasonable for someone to want control over their schedule and home environment. The partner's family's habit of surprising each other might be a cultural norm or a family tradition, but that doesn't override the author's needs. The key point is that the author is asserting their boundaries in their own home, which is valid.\n\nThe conflict arises from differing expectations. The partner is defending her family's behavior, but the author is clarifying their own limits. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" seems harsh if the author was merely stating their preferences. The partner's family might be used to having things their way, so the author's directness might feel like a challenge to their norms.\n\nThe meal was pre-booked, indicating planning, so the author's need for scheduled time is understandable. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling that her family's traditions are being dismissed. However, the author is entitled to express their discomfort, especially since it's their shared home. The partner should acknowledge both perspectives and find a middle ground, like giving advance notice for visits.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The issue is more about the partner's family not respecting those boundaries and the partner not mediating the situation effectively. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
