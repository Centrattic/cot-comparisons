I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which has caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their partner had a planned dinner after a trip. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends dropping by unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author disagrees. They mentioned that they might have things to do and want some alone time, and that the house should be clean. This led to a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair, and the author's partner's family labeling them as aggressive.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider cultural differences here. In some cultures, dropping by unannounced is common and seen as friendly, but in others, it's considered rude. The author is asserting their personal space and boundaries, which is generally acceptable. However, the way they expressed it might matter. The author mentioned they usually bite their tongue, so this might be the first time they voiced their opinion, leading to the family's negative reaction. \n\nThe partner's family might not be used to such boundaries, so the author's statement could come across as abrupt. But the author has a right to their own space. The key here is whether setting boundaries is wrong. Since the author is part of the household now, they have an equal claim to the space. The family's assumption that they can drop by whenever without notice might be infringing on the author's personal space. \n\nThe partner's side is defending the family's tradition or custom, but the author is also valid in wanting to set boundaries. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The author isn't necessarily wrong for expressing their discomfort. They are advocating for their needs, which is a healthy part of a relationship. \n\nSo, considering that setting boundaries is not wrong, especially in a shared living space, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
