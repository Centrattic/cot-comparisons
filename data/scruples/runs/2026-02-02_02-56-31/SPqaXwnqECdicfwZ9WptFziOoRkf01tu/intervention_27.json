I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a planned fancy dinner. The partner and her family think it's nice to surprise each other at home, but the user doesn't like it. They explained their reasons: needing personal time and not wanting to be interrupted with tasks. Now, the partner is saying it's unfair, and the user is seen as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nFirst, the user's perspective: They value their privacy and alone time. They have a valid point about needing space and not wanting to be caught off guard. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially in a shared living space. The user is sharing their feelings, which is important for healthy communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner and her family see surprise visits as a positive, a way to connect. But they might not realize that the user's needs are different. The user's partner is taking their side, which could strain the relationship if the user's needs aren't respected. The user's partner might not be considering the user's boundaries, which is a problem.\n\nThe user was labeled as aggressive, which is unfair. Expressing a preference isn't aggression; it's about setting healthy boundaries. The user was trying to be accommodating by not voicing their opinion before, but now it's causing a divide. The key here is mutual respect. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting their space. They should communicate clearly and set boundaries without guilt. The answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
