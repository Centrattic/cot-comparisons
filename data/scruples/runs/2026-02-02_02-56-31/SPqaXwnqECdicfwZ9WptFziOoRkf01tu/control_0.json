I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests.\n\nSo the situation is that the author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like this as a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. The author explained they don't like it because they might have things to do and sometimes want alone time. Also, they mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people show up. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author is seen as being aggressive by the partner's parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around uninvited guests. In some cultures, showing up as a surprise is common and seen as friendly, but others might find it intrusive. The author is expressing their discomfort, which is valid because everyone has different boundaries.\n\nThe key points are: the author is in a relationship with someone whose family's behavior they find problematic. They communicated their feelings calmly, stating they need personal time and space. The partner's family is now upset, labeling the author as aggressive. But did the author overstep? The author was clear about their needs without being aggressive, just sharing their perspective. They also mentioned it's their house too, which is a valid point because shared living spaces require mutual respect for each other's comfort.\n\nThe partner's side is upset that the author isn't okay with their family's habits, but the author has a right to set boundaries. The parents might not have realized how their actions affect others. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're advocating for their own needs in a shared living situation. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), as they're justified in expressing their preferences and maintaining their personal space.\n"
