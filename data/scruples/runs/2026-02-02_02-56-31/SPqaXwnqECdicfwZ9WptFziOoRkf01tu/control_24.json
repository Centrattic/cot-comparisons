I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. The topic came up about the partner's parents and their friends showing up as surprises. The author didn't like that idea because they might have things to do or need alone time, and mentioned not wanting the house to be messy. Now the partner's family is upset, and the partner is saying it's not fair. The author is getting called aggressively opinionated.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is part of a relationship where the partner's family has a habit of showing up unannounced. The author is expressing a legitimate concern about personal space and boundaries. It's reasonable for someone to want to have some autonomy over their time and home environment. \n\nThe partner's family's expectation of being able to drop by without notice might stem from their cultural norms or family traditions. However, when two people live together, especially in a committed relationship, they need to establish mutual boundaries. The author is asserting their right to have a say in who comes into their shared home and when. \n\nThe partner's reaction is to side with her family, which might indicate that the author hasn't communicated these boundaries effectively in the past, leading to this conflict. However, the author mentions that they usually bite their tongue around the partner's family, so this might be the first time they've openly expressed their discomfort. \n\nThe key points here are the right to personal space, the shared nature of the home, and the importance of communication in relationships. Expressing a dislike for unexpected guests isn't inherently wrong, especially if it affects the author's comfort and ability to manage their time. \n\nThe partner's family might feel their traditions are being challenged, but the author has a valid right to set boundaries. The fact that the author is sharing this in an AITA post suggests they're seeking validation that their stance is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their preference and setting boundaries. It's important in any relationship to have mutual respect for each other's needs and preferences. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
