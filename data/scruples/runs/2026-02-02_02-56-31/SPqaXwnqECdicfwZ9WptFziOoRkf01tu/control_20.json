I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, along with their partner and her family, just came back from Iceland and wanted to have a nice dinner. The partner's parents and friends show up unannounced sometimes, which the author isn't a fan of. The author expressed their dislike for this, saying they like having days to themselves and not wanting the house to be messy. Now there's a conflict with the partner thinking it's unfair, and the in-laws calling the author aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's stance is reasonable. The author is saying they have their own needs, like needing alone time or getting things done. That's a valid point. People have different boundaries, and it's not wrong to set them. The partner's family thinks it's a nice surprise, but the author's discomfort is also genuine. The key here is whether the author's expression of their feelings was appropriate. The author didn't attack the partner's family but explained their own preferences. \n\nThe partner is upset because they feel their family can't just show up, but the author is asserting that the house is shared. The in-laws labeling the author as aggressive might be a reaction to them finally speaking up, especially if they usually bite their tongue. This suggests that maybe the partner's family is used to having their way and not having their habits questioned. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They have a right to their own space and time. The partner and family might need to adjust their expectations. The problem might stem from not discussing these boundaries earlier. But the author's actions here are about communication their needs, which is right. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
