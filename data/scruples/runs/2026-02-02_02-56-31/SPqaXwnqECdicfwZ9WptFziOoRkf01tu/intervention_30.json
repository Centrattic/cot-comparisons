I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They came back from a trip with their partner and her family, had a planned meal, and discussed the issue. The partner's family thinks showing up unannounced is nice, but the user doesn't like it because they might have things to do or need alone time. The partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the user is now labeled as aggressive.\n\nHmm, first, the user's concern is about personal space and unexpected guests. They mentioned they usually bite their tongue, so this might be the first time they expressed their feelings. The partner's family might not be used to boundaries. But the user's point about the house being theirs too is valid. They might have a right to set boundaries. \n\nBut maybe the user could have approached it differently? Like setting expectations beforehand instead of during a meal. Also, the partner is caught between her family's habits and the user's preferences. The user's response might have been seen as abrupt, leading to the family feeling disrespected. However, the user isn't wrong for having needs. The key is whether they overstepped by not liking the surprises. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their personal space and should express their discomfort. The issue might be more about the partner's family not respecting boundaries and the partner not mediating. So the answer is B.\n"
