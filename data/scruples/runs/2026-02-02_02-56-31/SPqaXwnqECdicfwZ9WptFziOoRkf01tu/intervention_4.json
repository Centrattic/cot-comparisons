I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for disliking unexpected guests. Their partner and her family are used to showing up unannounced as a surprise. The user expressed their discomfort, mentioning they might have things to do and need personal space. The partner feels it's unfair, and the user's house is now seen as a shared space.\n\nFirst, the user has the right to their own space and preferences. Boundaries are important in relationships. Just because the partner's family has a different norm doesn't mean the user should suppress their feelings. The user's response was about their own needs, which is valid. However, the way the issue is being framed by the partner and family might indicate a communication problem. The user might need to discuss this more calmly to find a compromise, but they're not wrong for having those feelings. The key points are autonomy and mutual respect. So, the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
