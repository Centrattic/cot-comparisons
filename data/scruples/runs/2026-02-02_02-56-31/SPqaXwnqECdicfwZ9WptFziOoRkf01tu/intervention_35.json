I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They had a situation where they and their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a dinner reservation. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The user expressed discomfort with this, saying they need time for themselves and don't want the house in disarray if someone drops by. Now there's a conflict because the partner and her family feel it's unfair, and the user is seen as being too opinionated.\n\nFirst, the user's right to set boundaries. It's their home too, so they have a valid point about not wanting surprise visits. The partner's family might see it as a cultural difference or a generality about family time. But the user isn't wrong for wanting personal space. The problem here is that the user didn't communicate this before, maybe, which caused a divide. But the issue isn't about being wrong per se, but about differing expectations. The user isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs. However, maybe they could have handled the conversation differently, but the content itself is justified. The family's reaction of labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" is a bit harsh, implying the user's right to express their preference. So, answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
