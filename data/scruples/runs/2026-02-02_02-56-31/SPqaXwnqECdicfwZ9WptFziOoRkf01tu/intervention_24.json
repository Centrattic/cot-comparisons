I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner had a disagreement where the partner's family is used to showing up unannounced, but the user doesn't like that. The user expressed their discomfort, saying they need alone time and not wanting the house in a mess. The partner's family now thinks the user is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, boundaries in relationships are important. When you live together, especially with a partner's family, you have the right to set boundaries. The user isn't against socializing, but against surprises. They gave valid reasons: needing alone time and not wanting to be unprepared. The partner's side seems to feel that this is restrictive, but the user's feelings are valid.\n\nIt's common for different families to have different social norms. The user's partner might be caught between her family's expectations and her partner's boundaries. The user isn't being unreasonable here; they're advocating for their personal space, which is a basic right. The family's reaction to the user being \"aggressively opinionated\" suggests they might not have considered the user's perspective. \n\nThe key point is mutual respect. If the user's partner and her family can't respect the user's need for prior notice, that's a problem. The user isn't wrong for setting these limits. So, the answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
