I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner's family came back from Iceland, had a meal where they discussed the family's habit of showing up unannounced. The user expressed their dislike, saying they want privacy and time to themselves, and mentioned the house state. Now the partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the user is labeled as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nHmm. First, setting boundaries is important. The user has the right to their own space and time. They mentioned it's their house too, which is a key point. The partner's family might have different customs, but that doesn't mean the user's feelings are invalid. The user did express their opinion calmly, so being called aggressive seems unwarranted. The partner is defending her family but should also consider the user's perspective. It's a cultural difference maybe, but both sides need to meet in the middle. The user isn't wrong to set these boundaries. So, answer B.\n"
