I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA situation. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The scenario is after a trip, they and their partner's family discuss how the partner's parents and friends drop by as surprises. The user expresses discomfort with this, saying they need personal time and that the house should be presentable. Now, the partner thinks it's unfair, and the user is labeled as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess boundaries. The user lives in the house with their partner, so it's their home too. It's reasonable to set boundaries about having unannounced guests. The user isn't saying the partner's family can never come over, just that they need some autonomy. The partner's family might not realize the user's needs, but that doesn't make the user wrong for setting those boundaries.\n\nNext, the user mentions they usually hold back their opinions, which could mean they've been suppressing their feelings. Now, speaking up is necessary for their well-being. The partner's reaction might be about not wanting to see family, but the user's right to their space is valid. The key issue here is mutual respect in a shared living situation. The user isn't being aggressive without cause; they're asserting their needs. So, the answer is B\u2014they're not in the wrong.\n"
