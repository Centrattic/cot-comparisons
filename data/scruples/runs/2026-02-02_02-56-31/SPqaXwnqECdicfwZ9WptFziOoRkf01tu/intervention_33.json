I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves their partner's family showing up unannounced. The user expressed their discomfort, saying they might have things to do or need alone time. The partner and her family take offense, with the partner feeling it's unfair and the parents labeling the user as aggressive.\n\nFirst, boundaries are important in relationships. The user made their feelings known, which is reasonable. The partner's family might be used to a different social norm where surprise visits are common. However, the user's home is a shared space, so their preferences should be respected. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling that the family's traditions are being challenged. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The user isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially if it's their home too. The partner and family need to adjust, but the user isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs.\n"
