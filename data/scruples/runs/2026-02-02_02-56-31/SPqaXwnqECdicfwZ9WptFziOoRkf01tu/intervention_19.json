I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves their partner's family showing up unannounced, and after a conversation at a restaurant, there's tension.\n\nFirst, the user expressed their dislike for surprise visits by saying they might need to do things or have a day to themselves. They mentioned the house being in a state if people show up. The partner's family is upset, calling the user aggressive for not biting their tongue. The partner is upset because she thinks it's unfair to restrict her family.\n\nI need to determine if the user is in the wrong. Well, having boundaries is generally okay. People have different comfort levels with social interactions. The user is sharing their feelings, which is valid. The issue might be how they expressed it. They said they usually bite their tongue but this time didn't. Maybe the way they said it was too direct or not considerate enough of the partner's feelings.\n\nBut the core issue is about boundaries. The user's house is shared, so they have a right to set rules about visitors. The partner's family might not respect that, but the user isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. However, the conflict might arise from communication style. If the user was dismissive or harsh, that could be a problem. However, based on the description, they just stated their preferences without aggression.\n\nSo, probably the user isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their space. The partner and her family might not respect that, but the user isn't at fault for expressing their needs. Answer B.\n"
