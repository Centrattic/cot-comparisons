I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner and her family are used to surprising each other, but they don't like it. They mentioned they're not a fan because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and they don't want the house to be messy. The partner is saying it's unfair, and the family is calling the user aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to think about boundaries. When people have different expectations in a relationship, especially when combining families, boundaries are important. The user has a right to their personal space and time. It's common for people to have off days where they don't want guests. The user's concern about the house being in a state is valid too; people usually like their space to be presentable. \n\nBut the partner's family is used to dropping by, so there's a cultural or familial norm here. The partner is caught between her family's habits and her partner's preferences. The user's response might have come across as abrupt if they hadn't communicated this before. The partner might feel that her family's tradition is being challenged, leading to tension.\n\nThe user isn't wrong for expressing their needs, especially if they're part of a couple and the house is shared. However, communication style matters. If the user didn't discuss this earlier, it might have been a shock to the partner and her family. The user's approach might need to be more collaborative, finding a middle ground, like setting times when unexpected guests are okay and when they're not. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the user isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their preferences. The partner's family might need to adjust, but it's a two-way street. The user's being open about their feelings is necessary for their well-being. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from not discussing this in a more constructive way. So the answer would be B, the user isn't in the wrong, but they could work on communication strategies to ease the situation.\n"
