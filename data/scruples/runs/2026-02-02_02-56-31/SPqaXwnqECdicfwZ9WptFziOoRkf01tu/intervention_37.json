I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner had a conflict about this after coming back from Iceland. The partner's family thinks showing up unannounced is nice, but the user doesn't like it because they might be busy or need alone time. The partner is upset that the user isn't okay with it, and the user's been labeled as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about personal boundaries versus family traditions or expectations. The user is expressing their need for personal space and time, which is a valid point. On the other hand, the partner and her family see unexpected visits as a positive social norm. \n\nThe user's response was to state their preferences clearly without being confrontational, saying they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. They also mentioned the house being in a state, which is a practical concern. The partner and family's reaction is seeing this as unfair or aggressive, which might stem from a lack of understanding or different values.\n\nFrom a boundary perspective, it's reasonable for the user to set limits on their own home. No one should feel pressured to have guests whenever they don't want to. The user isn't wrong for wanting to maintain their personal space. However, the way the partner and family are reacting could be because they're used to a different dynamic. The user might need to communicate their needs more effectively, maybe with the partner's support, to bridge the understanding gap.\n\nThe key here is that the user isn't being inconsiderate; they're asserting their own needs. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because having personal boundaries is important and valid. The user isn't being aggressive just for stating their preferences, especially in their own home.\n"
