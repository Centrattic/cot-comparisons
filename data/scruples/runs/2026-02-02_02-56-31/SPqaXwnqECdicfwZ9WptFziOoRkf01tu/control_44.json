I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not liking unexpected guests. They went on a trip with their partner and her family, and after returning, they had a pre-booked meal. During the meal, the conversation turned to the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they need alone time and don't want the house messy. The partner's family is upset, saying the author is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, the key points are the author's boundaries versus the partner's family's expectations. The author is in a relationship, so their partner is part of this dynamic. The partner's family might be used to being spontaneous, but the author isn't. The argument is about whether the author is wrong for setting these boundaries.\n\nThe author's concern is valid because everyone has the right to personal space and privacy. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but now expressed them could be seen as a justified boundary. The partner's family labeling the author as aggressive suggests they might not respect these boundaries, but the author isn't wrong for wanting them. The house is shared, so the author's input matters. The partner seems to be caught between her family's habits and her partner's preferences. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're asserting their needs. So, the answer is B\u2014they're not in the wrong.\n"
