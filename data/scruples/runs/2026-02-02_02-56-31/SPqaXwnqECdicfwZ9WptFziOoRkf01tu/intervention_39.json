I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They had a conflict with their partner and her family about showing up unannounced. The key points here are the setting and the communication involved.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that they expressed their discomfort with surprise visits, explaining that they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. They also said the house might not be in order if guests drop by. The partner's family seems to think it's a nice surprise, but the user's stance caused tension.\n\nI need to consider boundaries and mutual respect. If the user is living in the same house as their partner's family, it's reasonable to expect some level of consideration for their personal space and time. The user isn't against social visits entirely but prefers planned ones. That's a common preference. The partner's side might not have considered the user's need for privacy or preparation time, which is important in any shared living situation.\n\nThe user's response was straightforward and explained their reasons without being aggressive. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" from the parents seems unfair if the user was just stating their preferences. It's about setting boundaries, which is healthy in relationships. The partner needs to mediate and ensure both sides' needs are met. The user isn't in the wrong for advocating for their own needs. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
