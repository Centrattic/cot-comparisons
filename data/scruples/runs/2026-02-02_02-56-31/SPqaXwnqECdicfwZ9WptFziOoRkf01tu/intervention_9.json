I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThey went on a trip with their partner and her family, then came back to have a pre-booked fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The user expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and they also mentioned the house being in a state if people show up unannounced. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair and the parents labeling the user as aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, the user's stance is about personal space and boundaries. They have a right to their own preferences. The partner's family sees surprise visits as nice, but the user is uncomfortable. The key here is mutual respect. The user didn't say it's wrong for the partner's family to want to do that; they just expressed their own discomfort. The partner and her family might not be respecting the user's boundaries, especially since the user mentioned biting their tongue before, which could mean they've been suppressing their feelings. \n\nThe user's comment about the house being in a state is a valid point about privacy and preparation. The partner's reaction seems to be about fairness, but fairness also includes considering the user's needs. The parents' reaction to being labeled \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misinterpretation of the user's honest communication. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to find a balance where both sets of needs are considered. The user isn't in the wrong here because they're advocating for their own boundaries. The issue might be more about the partner's family not understanding or respecting those boundaries, not the user being at fault.\n"
