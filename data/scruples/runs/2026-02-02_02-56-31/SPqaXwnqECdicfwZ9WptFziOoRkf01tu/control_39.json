I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the writer's partner and her family who are okay with showing up unannounced, but the writer isn't. The key points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect.\n\nFirst, the writer expressed their feelings in a respectful way. They mentioned that they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, which is a valid reason for not wanting unexpected visitors. They also mentioned the house being in order, which is a practical concern. So, the writer isn't being unreasonable here.\n\nThe partner and her family, on the other hand, see the surprise visits as a nice gesture. However, the writer's main issue is that these visits happen without notice, which can be stressful. The writer's response was to communicate their discomfort, which is appropriate. The partner's reaction seems to be that the writer is being unfair, but the writer is asserting their right to have the house as much as the partner does. That's a fair point because shared spaces should respect both parties' needs.\n\nThe family labeling the writer as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a bit harsh. The writer was sharing their opinion, which is necessary for setting boundaries. The fact that the writer usually holds back their opinions but now feels the need to speak up suggests that this is a significant issue for them. \n\nIn relationships, especially with blended families, communication is key. Both sides need to listen and find a compromise. The writer isn't wrong for not wanting unannounced guests, especially if they've communicated their feelings. The partner and family might need to adjust their behavior, but the writer isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
