I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which is causing a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their partner, along with her family, returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and their friends drop by without notice. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining that they might have other things to do and sometimes need alone time. The partner's family now sees the author as being too aggressive in stating their opinion, and the partner is upset because she feels her family's traditions are being challenged.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n1. The author is uncomfortable with unannounced visits.\n2. They communicated their feelings, which led to tension.\n3. The partner's family is upset, labeling the author as aggressive.\n4. The partner is caught between both sides.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether expressing a preference about having unexpected guests is unreasonable. In many cultures, unexpected guests can be considered impolite because hosts should be informed to prepare. However, some families have different customs where surprise visits are seen as friendly. The author's house is also shared, so they have a right to set boundaries. \n\nThe author did express their feelings calmly, stating their reasons (personal time, needing to get things done, and not wanting the house messy). They didn't forbid the visits outright but communicated their preference. The partner's family's reaction might be due to cultural differences or not expecting such a direct response. \n\nThe partner's side seems to be defending her family's habits, which is natural. However, the author's right to their own space is valid. The main issue here is a clash of expectations. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries in their own home. They aren't being aggressive if they stated their views without hostility. The family's reaction might stem from feeling their traditions are being criticized, but the author's stance is about personal space and time, which is a reasonable need.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their discomfort and setting boundaries. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior, or there's a need for mutual understanding. But the author's actions don't make them the asshole in this scenario. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
