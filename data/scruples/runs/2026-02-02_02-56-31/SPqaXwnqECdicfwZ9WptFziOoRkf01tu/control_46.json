I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family who just came back from Iceland. They had a nice meal, and during the conversation, the author expressed their discomfort with the family's habit of showing up unannounced. The partner is upset, and the author's opinions are making the partner's family label them as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is stating their boundary, which is about personal space and time. They mentioned they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The partner's side sees this as a problem, saying it's unfair they can't just drop by. The author's house is shared, so they feel it's their right to have privacy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, having guests without prior notice can be seen as inconsiderate, but it's also a cultural or family norm for some. The author is setting a boundary, which is healthy. However, the way they communicated it might have come off as abrupt if they didn't consider the partner's perspective. But the partner's family is now upset because they weren't expecting that reaction. \n\nThe author is part of the relationship, so their input matters. The house is shared, so both parties' preferences should be respected. The author isn't wrong for wanting privacy. However, maybe there's a need for a compromise, like setting clear expectations without dismissing the partner's family's traditions. But in this case, the author isn't in the wrong because they're expressing their needs. The partner might need to mediate between both families' expectations. \n\nThe answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their own space and time. The issue might be more about the partner not balancing both families' needs, but the author's stance is valid.\n"
