I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family came back from a trip and had a booked fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like that, but the author doesn't. They explained they don't like it because they might have things to do and need some alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks it's not fair, and the author's partner's family labels them as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is expressing their discomfort with unannounced visits, which is a reasonable stance. People have different boundaries when it comes to privacy and personal space. The author's main points are about needing time to themselves and the potential issue of the house not being presentable. These are valid concerns. On the other hand, the partner's family sees these visits as nice surprises, which might be a cultural or family tradition. The partner is caught in the middle, advocating for her family's habits versus her partner's comfort.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are communication and mutual respect. The author did express their feelings calmly, stating their reasons without being confrontational. They even finished with a polite note about the house state. The partner's family, however, took offense, labeling the author as aggressively opinionated. That suggests the family might not be receptive to differing opinions. The author's partner is siding with her family, which complicates things.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners' needs are considered. The author's right to have their boundaries respected is valid. The partner's family needs to understand that the author has different preferences. The conflict arises from the family's inability to accept these boundaries, not necessarily from the author's initial stance. The author isn't being aggressive; they're asserting their needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their feelings appropriately, and the issue stems from the other party's unwillingness to adjust their behavior.\n"
