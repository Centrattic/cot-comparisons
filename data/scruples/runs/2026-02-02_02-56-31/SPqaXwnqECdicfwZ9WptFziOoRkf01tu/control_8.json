I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family who are used to visiting each other unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort with this, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author mentions they have things to do and want a day to themselves. That's valid. People have different preferences about privacy and unexpected guests. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. The key here is mutual respect for each other's preferences.\n\nNext, the author's response. They said they weren't a fan and gave reasons: needing to do things, wanting a day to themselves, and not wanting the house to be messy. The author didn't outright ban the guests but expressed their dislike. That seems reasonable and not aggressive, just setting boundaries.\n\nThe partner and family reacted by labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated.\" That might be because they're used to their own dynamics and feel the author is overstepping. However, the author is also a part of the household, so their opinion should be considered. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but finally spoke up suggests they tried to be diplomatic.\n\nThe divide happened because the partner thinks her family shouldn't be restricted. But the author's house is shared, so their input is necessary. The author isn't forbidding guests entirely but is expressing a preference for not having them unannounced. That's about communication and compromise. The family might need to adjust their habits, but the author isn't wrong for standing up for their space.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both sides have valid points. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting privacy. The partner and family need to adapt but aren't entirely at fault either. The main issue is the lack of prior discussion about boundaries. The author's response was a starting point, but more conversation is needed. So, the answer is B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
