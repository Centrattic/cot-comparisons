I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who posted the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) question is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not liking unexpected guests, leading to a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner had a pre-booked fancy dinner after returning from a trip. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister found this nice, but the author didn't. The author expressed discomfort, mentioning needing personal time and not wanting the house to be messy if guests showed up without notice. This led to the partner feeling it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author's partner and in-laws now see the author as overly opinionated despite usually holding back their views.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, some people are more open to surprise visits than others. The author is asserting their boundaries, which is a reasonable thing to do. They're not wrong for wanting personal space and privacy, especially in their own home. The partner's family might have different expectations, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The key here is that the author is communicating their feelings, which is important in relationships to avoid resentment.\n\nThe partner's reaction suggests they might not have considered the author's perspective before. The author is standing up for their needs, which is valid. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but chose to speak up in this case shows they're trying to set boundaries. Being labeled as aggressive just because they expressed their preferences is not fair. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're advocating for their personal space and needs, which is important in maintaining a healthy relationship. The issue seems more about differing expectations and the need for better communication between all parties involved.\n"
