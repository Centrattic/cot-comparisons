I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner had a discussion after a trip where the partner's family and friends drop by unannounced. The user expressed discomfort with this, saying they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and that the house should be ready for such visits. The partner's family now thinks the user is being aggressive or overly opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. When two people live together, especially with their families, mutual respect for each other's preferences is important. The user has a valid point about needing personal time and not wanting the house in disarray. It's reasonable to set boundaries. However, the way the user expressed their opinion might have been a factor. They mentioned they usually \"bite their tongue,\" so this time they spoke up, which might have come across as harsh.\n\nThe partner's family is used to unannounced visits, so the user's objection could be seen as a sudden change. But that doesn't mean the user is wrong. It's about balancing both sides. The user isn't being unreasonable; they have legitimate needs. The issue might be communication style. If the user's approach was more collaborative, maybe the reaction wouldn't be so strong. But the user isn't in the wrong for having their own preferences. The key is that both sides need to negotiate and find a middle ground. So, the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
