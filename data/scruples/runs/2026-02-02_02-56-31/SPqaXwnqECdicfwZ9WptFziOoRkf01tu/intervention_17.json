I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They had a meal after a trip and discussed how their partner's family often shows up unannounced. The user expressed their discomfort, leading to a conflict with their partner and in-laws.\n\nFirst, the user's perspective: They value personal space and time, and don't want to be bothered when they're busy. They mentioned their house being in a state if people show up unannounced. That's a valid concern for many people.\n\nPartner's side: She and her family see it as a nice surprise. They might have a different cultural or personal approach to social interactions. The user's partner feels her family should be able to drop by, which is understandable if that's their norm.\n\nThe key issue here is boundaries. The user is asserting their right to have a space where they can have time alone or not be disturbed, which is reasonable. However, the partner's family is used to a more open, spontaneous style of visiting. The user's statement about the house being in a state could also be seen as a valid concern about respecting their home.\n\nThe user's partner is upset because she feels the family can't just show up. The user is standing their ground, which is okay. The in-laws labeled the user as aggressively opinionated, possibly because they're not used to such boundaries. But does that make the user at fault? Probably not. It's more about differing expectations and the need for communication and mutual understanding.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a middle ground. The user isn't wrong for having their preferences. The problem might be in how the discussion was handled, but the core issue is valid. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because having personal space needs is reasonable and shouldn't be seen as aggressive.\n"
