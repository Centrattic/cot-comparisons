I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner and her family consider surprise visits a nice gesture, but the user prefers privacy and time to themselves.\n\nFirst, the user's perspective: They value personal space and time, which is valid. They expressed their concerns calmly, explaining their need for time to themselves and not wanting the house in disarray. It's reasonable to set boundaries in a shared living space, especially regarding unexpected guests.\n\nThe partner's side: They think it's unfair that the user doesn't allow these surprise visits. The partner's family might feel entitled to visit since it's their family's house. However, if the user is a partner in the household, they should have equal say in how the home is managed. The partner might be prioritizing family traditions over the user's comfort, which could be a point of conflict.\n\nThe family's reaction: Labeling the user as \"aggressively opinionated\" suggests they didn't receive the feedback well. The user was diplomatic, so the family's response might be defensive or dismissive. It's possible the family hasn't considered the user's perspective before, leading to tension when boundaries are set.\n\nKey points to consider: The home is shared, so both parties should have input. The user's right to privacy and personal time is important. The partner's family's tradition of surprise visits is their cultural or familial norm, but that shouldn't override another person's comfort. The user isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries; the issue might be the family's unwillingness to adjust.\n\nIs the user at fault? No. They have a right to their preferences in a shared living space. The conflict arises from differing expectations and the family's resistance to change. The user expressed their concerns politely, so they aren't in the wrong for having those boundaries. The partner and family need to find a middle ground, respecting both the user's space and their tradition of visits.\n"
