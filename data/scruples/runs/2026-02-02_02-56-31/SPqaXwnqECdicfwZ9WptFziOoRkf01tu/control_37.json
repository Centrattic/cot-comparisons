I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced at each other's houses came up. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author is not a fan, explaining that they might have things to do or want a day to themselves and that the house might not be presentable. The partner is now upset, saying it's not fair, and the author's being called aggressive for not biting their tongue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a valid personal preference. People have different comfort levels with privacy and surprise visits. The author's partner and family view the unannounced visits positively, seeing them as spontaneous and thoughtful. However, the author feels that their privacy and personal space are being invaded. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author did express their feelings calmly, stating their reasons. They mentioned having things to do and wanting time alone, which are reasonable needs. The partner and her family might not have considered how their actions affect the author. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author should have discussed this before the trip or in a more private setting? The conversation happened during dinner, which could be seen as an inopportune time. However, the situation is about ongoing behavior (unexpected guests), so bringing it up in that context makes sense. \n\nThe partner is now taking it as an issue of fairness, implying the author is being unreasonable by not wanting their family to come over. The author's response about the house not being in a state is about personal standards, which is also valid. \n\nThe partner's family is labeling the author as aggressive. The author's tone during the dinner conversation could be a factor, but they described their response as stating their feelings clearly. If the author typically bites their tongue, this might be a breakthrough for them, which could be perceived as more direct than usual but not necessarily aggressive. \n\nIn relationships, especially when merging families, compromise is necessary. The author has a right to set boundaries in their own home, which they share with their partner. The partner's family might not have realized the impact of their actions. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs and boundaries, which is important for a healthy relationship. The partner and her family need to adjust their expectations, not the other way around. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
