I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They had a disagreement with their partner's family after expressing their dislike for surprise visits. The partner is upset because her family sees it as a nice surprise, but the user feels it's intrusive. The user ended up saying the house is theirs as well, and the family now thinks they're too aggressive.\n\nFirst, boundaries are important in relationships. The user has a right to their personal space and time. It's reasonable to want to know when guests are coming, especially if you have plans. The partner's family might not realize how these surprises affect others.\n\nThe user didn't say they wanted to stop the visits entirely, just that they don't like them. They also mentioned not having to worry about the house being messy, which is a valid concern. The partner's family's reaction seems a bit harsh, labeling the user as aggressive. That might be an overreaction.\n\nBut the partner is caught in the middle. Maybe she didn't expect this response. However, the user's right to their space isn't invalid just because the family has different expectations. It's about mutual respect. The user isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially if they were communicated calmly.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. The user isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their preferences and should be able to express them without being labeled negatively. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations, but that doesn't mean the user is at fault here.\n"
