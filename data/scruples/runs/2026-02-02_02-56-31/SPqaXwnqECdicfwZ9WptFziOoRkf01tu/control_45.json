I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author and their partner, along with her family, returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and friends dropping by as surprises. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do or want a day to themselves. The author mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people show up unannounced. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair her family can't just visit whenever, and the author's been called aggressive.\n\nFirst, the key point here is about boundaries. The author is expressing their preference to have personal space and time, which is a reasonable expectation. It's common for people to have different social norms; while some enjoy spontaneity, others value privacy. The author's house is shared with their partner, so it's valid to set rules about unannounced visits. The partner's family might not understand this, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The partner's reaction seems to be about defending her family's habits, but the author is asserting their own needs. The author isn't being aggressive if they're communicating their boundaries respectfully. The family's label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from their own discomfort with the new boundary, not the author's behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong for stating their preferences. Answer B.\n"
