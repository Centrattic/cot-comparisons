I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family were on a trip. They had a fancy dinner planned to wrap up the holiday. During that dinner, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends just show up unannounced. The partner and sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. The author explained they might have things to do, want a day to themselves, and don't want the house to be messy if people drop by. Now, the partner is saying it's unfair, and the author is seen as aggressive by the partner's parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, unexpected visits are common and seen as friendly. But in others, people prefer to be called ahead of time. The author is sharing their personal boundary, which is valid. They mentioned it's their house too, so having a say in who comes in when makes sense. The partner's family might not realize the author's perspective, especially if they're used to a different way. \n\nThe author didn't just lash out; they explained their reasons calmly. They said they usually bite their tongue, so this time they finally spoke up. The partner's family is now labeling them as aggressive, maybe because they're not used to someone setting boundaries. That could be a problem for the partner's family, not the author. \n\nThe partner is taking sides with her family, saying it's unfair. But the author's house is shared, so their input is necessary. The author isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries. They have the right to expect some privacy and control over their living space. The conflict arises because the partner and family didn't consider the author's needs until now. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their personal space and preferences. The issue is more about the partner and family not respecting those boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
