I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner's family often shows up unannounced, and they expressed their dislike for this during a meal after a trip. The partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the user's partner's parents think they're being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's right to privacy and personal space is important. No one should feel pressured to host unexpected visitors, especially if they have plans or need personal time. The user's partner's family might see it as a friendly gesture, but that doesn't negate the user's feelings. \n\nHowever, the user did express their opinion after the trip, which might have come up in conversation. Maybe they should have addressed it sooner rather than letting it build up. But the user mentions they usually bite their tongue, so this was a first-time expression. \n\nThe partner is now taking their side family, which could indicate a deeper issue in the relationship about boundaries. The key here is whether the user crossed a line. They stated their preferences calmly, emphasizing their need for personal space and not wanting the house untidy. That seems reasonable. \n\nThe partner's family's reaction to being labeled aggressively opinionated might be because the user finally voiced a boundary they hadn't before. It's possible the user isn't in the wrong here. They have the right to their own space, and expressing that shouldn't be unfair. But the situation could also highlight a communication issue in the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The user is justified in setting boundaries about their home and personal time. The issue might be more about the partner and her family not respecting those boundaries or expecting different social norms.\n"
