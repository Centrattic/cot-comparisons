I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from Iceland and had a meal. The topic came up about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author didn't like the idea, explaining that they might need time to themselves and don't want to be disturbed. The partner's family reacted negatively, calling the author aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is expressing discomfort with surprise visits. They mentioned they might have things to do and prefer some alone time. The partner is upset because the author didn't support the idea of family showing up whenever. The partner's family labels the author as aggressive for expressing their opinion.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and personal boundaries. In some cultures, surprise visits are common and seen as friendly. However, in others, people value personal space and privacy more. The author's house is shared with their partner, so they have a right to set boundaries. The partner's family might not be used to such boundaries, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author didn't shout or act out; they stated their opinion calmly. The partner's family's reaction seems harsh. The partner is taking the side of her family, which might indicate a deeper issue in the relationship regarding communication and mutual respect. The author is defending their space, which is reasonable. \n\nPossible factors to consider: Did the author express their feelings in a respectful way? Yes, they explained their reasons. Have they had this issue before? The author mentions usually biting their tongue, so this might be a first-time assertion. The partner's family's response might be due to not being used to someone setting boundaries. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong for wanting privacy in their own home. The partner's family could be wrong for dismissing those boundaries. The partner might be in the middle, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to express their preference about their home and privacy. The family's criticism is unwarranted.\n"
