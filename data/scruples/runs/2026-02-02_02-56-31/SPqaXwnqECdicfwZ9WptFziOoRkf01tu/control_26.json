I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner's family has a habit of showing up unannounced, and the author expressed discomfort with that. The partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author's partner's family thinks the author is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author has a right to set boundaries in their own home. If someone is coming to your house uninvited, that's a common issue. People have different comfort levels with surprise visits. The author explained that they might have things to do or need alone time, which is reasonable. The partner's family might be used to being more spontaneous, but that doesn't mean it's okay to ignore someone else's preferences.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author did communicate their feelings, even if it was a bit direct. The partner's family is taking offense, but the author has a valid reason to want control over their space. The house is shared, so both partners' needs should be considered. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior, and the partner should mediate to find a middle ground. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
