I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and their partner's family had a disagreement about unexpected guests. The author didn't like the idea of people showing up unannounced, while the partner's family thought it was a nice surprise. The author's partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author's house is also part of their home, so they don't want to be bothered.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, dropping by uninvited is common. But in others, it's seen as impolite. The author's partner and her family seem to come from a culture where this is acceptable. The author is setting boundaries, which is their right. They're making their preferences known, which is important for their comfort.\n\nThe partner's family is taking offense, calling the author \"aggressively opinionated.\" But the author was just expressing their feelings without being confrontational. They mentioned they usually bite their tongue, so this was a rare moment of honesty. The partner is caught between her family's habits and her partner's boundaries.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They have every right to want privacy and control over their home. The issue is more about differing expectations and communication. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're asserting their needs. The partner and her family might need to adjust their behavior, but that doesn't make the author wrong here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
