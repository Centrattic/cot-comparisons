I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves their partner's family showing up unannounced, and the author expressing their dislike for that. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author and their partner had just returned from a trip and were at a restaurant. The conversation turned to the partner's parents and their friends dropping by as surprises. The author didn't like the idea, explaining they might need to do things or have a day to themselves. The partner and family don't see the issue, while the author feels the house is shared and that unexpected guests could be problematic.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. The author is stating their preference not to have surprise visits. It's reasonable for someone to want control over their personal space and time. The partner's family might be used to a different social norm where surprise visits are seen as friendly, but that doesn't mean the author's feelings are invalid.\n\nThe partner is mediating between her family's traditions and the author's needs. The author's response was about personal space and house maintenance, which are valid concerns. The term \"aggressively opinionated\" by the in-laws suggests the author might have come across as confrontational, but the content of the message seems justified.\n\nIn relationships, it's important both partners feel respected. Since the house is shared, the author's input should be considered. The issue isn't just about the guests; it's about mutual respect for each other's preferences. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries here. So the answer is B.\n"
