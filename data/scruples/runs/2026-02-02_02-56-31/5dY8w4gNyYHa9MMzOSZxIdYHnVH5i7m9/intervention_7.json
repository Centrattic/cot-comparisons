Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. They provided a detailed scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They moved in together, and she expected the guy to pay everything, which he did initially. Then when they moved in together, she stopped paying her share. He tried splitting the rent, but she couldn't pay. He ended up paying the full rent, which caused him financial stress. When she couldn't pay again, he asked her to leave.\n\nThe user is wondering if they made a mistake. The key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The user might feel wrong if they acted too harshly, but maybe they were justified if the other person wasn't contributing. However, kicking someone out of the apartment can be a big step. It's important to consider if there were communication issues or if there were other solutions they could have explored first.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that she expected the boyfriend to pay for everything might be problematic. Financial compatibility is a big part of a relationship, especially when living together. If one partner consistently isn't contributing, it can lead to conflict. However, the approach of \"kicking her out\" might be seen as extreme, but given the circumstances, maybe it was necessary for the user's financial stability.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's test comment is a bit concerning. Using a relationship to test someone's reaction to a crisis isn't healthy. The user might feel they overreacted, but if the financial strain was real, their action was a way to set boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user didn't act out of spite but out of necessity. However, perhaps there were better ways to handle it, like having a serious conversation about financial expectations upfront. But given the situation as described, the user's action might be justified. So the answer would lean towards B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
