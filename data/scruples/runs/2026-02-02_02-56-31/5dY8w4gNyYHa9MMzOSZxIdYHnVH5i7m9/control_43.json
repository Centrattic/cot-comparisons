Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her not paying rent is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend moved in and initially didn't pay rent, then when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share. The author paid the full rent, which strained his finances. The girlfriend didn't contribute as expected, and when confronted, she dismissed his concerns, leading to the breakup.\n\nI need to consider financial responsibility in relationships. While it's common for the guy to pay more traditionally, there's an expectation of some reciprocity. The girlfriend's lack of contribution, especially after they moved in together, is a problem. The author had tried splitting the rent but then she couldn't pay. The final incident where she refused to pay anything again and justified it by saying \"why do I have a boyfriend\" seems like a major issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to cover all expenses without contribution might be unreasonable. The author was left in a precarious financial situation, which is a valid reason for frustration. However, the question is whether he overreacted by kicking her out. \n\nIn some cultures, financial support might be expected more from the man, but mutual support and communication are key. The author had tried to accommodate her before, but her consistent inability or unwillingness to contribute, combined with her dismissive attitude, might have justified his decision. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test for emergencies is a red flag. It shows a lack of consideration for the partner's financial health. The author's decision to end the relationship under these circumstances seems reasonable. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
