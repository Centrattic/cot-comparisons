  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking up and kicking my girlfriend out of my apartment because she couldn\u2019t pay rent?\nShe\u2019s in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything, and against my better judgment I went with it. Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. First, I need to consider the context provided.\n\nThe couple moved in together, initially splitting rent, but the girlfriend stopped paying her share, citing her own financial issues. The user feels it's unfair because he's been covering most costs, and now he's stuck with full rent, affecting his finances. He broke up with her after she refused to contribute, even when he offered repayment terms. She later claims it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. From a fairness standpoint, splitting expenses is common in relationships. If both parties agreed to split, then not contributing is a breach of that agreement. The user tried to negotiate, even allowing repayment, but she couldn't or wouldn't. His decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave is a valid response to protect his financial stability. \n\nHowever, some might argue that relationships require compromise, and expecting equal financial contributions isn't always necessary. But given the history of her not paying her fair share (even before moving in together), the user has a valid reason to prioritize his financial health. Her claim that it was a test complicates things, but the user's reaction is about immediate financial stress, not just hypotheticals.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. He acted to protect himself after repeated issues. The answer should be B.\n"
