Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend and kicked her out of the apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The user is asking whether that decision was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details provided. The girlfriend moved into the author's apartment and didn't pay rent for six months. Then, when they moved in together, she initially split the rent but later couldn't pay. The author ended up covering the rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. The girlfriend then couldn't pay again, and when asked, she said \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" The author kicked her out. She later claims it was a test to see how he'd handle a tough situation.\n\nSo, the main issue here is financial responsibility in a relationship. The author feels that while they're okay with paying for most things, there needs to be some give and take. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to have expected the author to cover all expenses, especially rent, without contributing her share. The author is upset because their own financial stability is being compromised.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, many people believe that both partners should contribute to shared expenses, especially when living together. If one partner is consistently not pulling their weight, it can lead to resentment. The girlfriend's initial behavior\u2014living rent-free for six months\u2014is problematic. The author tried to be accommodating but was clearly unhappy about the imbalance.\n\nThe girlfriend's response when confronted is dismissive and seems to trivialize the author's financial struggles. Saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" implies that the author should handle everything, which is unfair and shows a lack of consideration for his situation.\n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave is a reaction to the ongoing financial strain and the girlfriend's lack of willingness to contribute. While it's a harsh action, given the circumstances, it might be seen as a necessary step to protect their own financial well-being.\n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test is questionable. Testing a partner's ability to handle financial stress doesn't seem like a fair or reasonable approach. The author's overreaction might be debated, but the underlying issue of financial responsibility is a valid concern.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to address the issue, but the girlfriend didn't take it seriously. The author's actions, while perhaps abrupt, were a response to a prolonged issue of financial imbalance. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
