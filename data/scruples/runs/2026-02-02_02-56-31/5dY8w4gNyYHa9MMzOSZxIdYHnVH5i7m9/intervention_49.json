Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. They had an arrangement where they paid for most things, and she sometimes contributed. When they moved in together, they split the rent initially, but she stopped paying, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, financial responsibility in relationships is a big topic. The user mentions they believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. When the girlfriend couldn't cover her share, the user felt it was unfair. The girlfriend's reasoning that the boyfriend should handle her financial issues seems flawed because it's not a balanced partnership.\n\nThe user acted by asking her to leave, which might seem harsh, but the context is that they were taking on more than their fair share. The girlfriend's approach of testing the user's reaction by not paying rent is problematic. It's not the same as an emergency; it's a recurring issue of her not contributing. The user prioritized their own financial stability, which is reasonable. They might not be in the wrong because the relationship was imbalanced, and they set boundaries. However, communication could have been better. Instead of abruptly kicking her out, discussing solutions might have helped. But given the repeated issues and her lack of effort, the user's decision makes sense. So the answer is B.\n"
