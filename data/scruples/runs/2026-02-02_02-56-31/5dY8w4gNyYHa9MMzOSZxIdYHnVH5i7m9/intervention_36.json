Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for breaking up and asking their ex to leave because she couldn't pay rent. So the main issue here is financial responsibility in a relationship.\n\nFirst, when they moved in together, they agreed to split the rent. But she couldn't pay her share, which he ended up covering. He's frustrated because he's shouldering all the costs while his own financial situation is suffering. \n\nI need to consider the norms around shared living expenses. Typically, when two people live together, they expect to split costs equally unless otherwise agreed. If she's unable to contribute, it's a valid reason for conflict. The user might feel like they're being taken advantage of, especially if the relationship wasn't balanced financially from the start.\n\nThe ex's argument that it was a \"test\" doesn't make sense. Testing someone's response to financial stress isn't a reasonable approach. That seems more like a manipulative tactic. The user had a right to be upset about the financial strain and the lack of reciprocity.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. It sounds like there wasn't any balance in their financial arrangements. If she moved in and couldn't pay her share, it's a significant issue. The user's decision to ask her to leave might be seen as standing up for their own financial well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user could have addressed the issue earlier, like discussing budgeting or setting clear expectations when moving in together. But given the history of her not contributing equally (groceries, bills, etc.), it's not like this was a sudden problem. \n\nThe user's reaction might be seen as justified because they were putting their own financial stability at risk. Relationships require mutual support, but if one person is consistently not pulling their weight, especially financially, it's reasonable to reassess the relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They had a right to expect financial equality and were protecting their own interests when the situation became unsustainable. The answer should be B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
