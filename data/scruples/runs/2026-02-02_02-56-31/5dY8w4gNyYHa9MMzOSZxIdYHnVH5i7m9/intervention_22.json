Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup where the person broke up with their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. He moved in with her, split the rent for a while, but then she started not paying her share due to her own financial issues. He ended up paying all the rent, which put him in a tough spot, and when she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. Initially, she helped with groceries and cleaning, but he felt it wasn't equal. Then when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent because of her debts. He paid the full rent, which caused him financial strain. When she couldn't pay again, he decided she should leave.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, splitting rent when living together is a common arrangement. If one partner can't pay their share, it can create tension. The user's frustration is understandable because he's shouldering the financial burden, which he didn't anticipate. However, the girlfriend's argument that her boyfriend should cover her financial issues might be seen as unfair, especially if there's no prior agreement about such scenarios.\n\nThe user's action of asking her to leave because she couldn't contribute might be seen as a way to protect his own financial stability. But maybe there's room for discussion on how they handled the situation. For example, setting clear expectations about financial responsibilities when moving in together could have helped. The user did mention trying to communicate, but the girlfriend didn't take it seriously, even suggesting it was a test. That test approach seems problematic because it's not realistic to expect someone to cover all expenses without any contribution.\n\nOn the other hand, the user could have tried to find a compromise, like adjusting their financial plan or seeking other solutions before deciding to end the relationship. But given that she had previously not contributed fairly and now was in a situation where she couldn't pay, maybe the user felt it was necessary to prioritize his own financial health. Relationships require mutual support, but there's a limit to what one person should bear alone.\n\nIn conclusion, while there might be some criticism about how the situation was handled, the user's decision to leave when it became unsustainable isn't clearly in the wrong. The girlfriend's expectations and lack of contribution likely contributed to the breakup. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
