Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, from the timeline: The girlfriend moved in in June 2018 and for six months didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. She did some cleaning but the user felt it wasn't equal. Then they moved in together, split the rent initially, but she couldn't pay due to her debts. The user paid the full rent, which put him in a financial bind. This month, she again can't pay anything, and when he asks her to pay back or help, she responds with \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" The user then kicks her out. She later says it was a test to see how he'd react in tough situations.\n\nThe user's arguments: He believes the guy should pay for most things but there should be give and take. He's in a precarious financial situation now because of her not contributing. He feels she's not taking responsibility for her share, expecting him to cover everything, which he's not okay with anymore.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She might feel that she's in a relationship where the expectation is the guy pays, and she's trying to manage her own debts. She claims the situation was a test for emergencies, implying she wanted to see his support in a crisis.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Let's consider relationship norms. In a shared living situation, especially when one person is paying all the rent, it's reasonable to expect some form of contribution, whether financial or otherwise. The user tried to split the rent initially, but she couldn't hold up her end. When she's unable to pay, he's forced to cover it, which strains his finances. His decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave because she's not contributing might seem harsh, but it's also about his own financial health. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting him to cover her expenses without reciprocity is problematic. Her response about the test suggests she didn't take his concerns seriously, expecting him to always bail her out.\n\nHowever, relationships involve compromise. If he knew she had financial issues before moving in together, maybe he should have set clearer boundaries. But given that she consistently didn't contribute and he's now in a tight spot, his reaction might be justified. The key here is that the user is taking responsibility for his own well-being and setting a boundary when it's clear she's not going to meet her obligations. The girlfriend's lack of accountability is a red flag, and the user's decision to end the relationship could be seen as necessary for his financial stability. So, probably, he's not in the wrong here.\n"
