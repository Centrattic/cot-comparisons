Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the writer mentions that they were paying for most things in the relationship, like dinners, events, trips, and groceries, and the girlfriend didn't contribute equally. She did some cleaning, but he felt it wasn't equal. Then, when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent due to her own debts. The writer paid the full rent, which put them in a financial strain. Now the girlfriend can't pay this month again, and when confronted, she says that's why she has a boyfriend. The writer then kicks her out and refuses to let her live there, paying all the rent. She later says it was a test to see his reaction if she had an accident, but the writer thinks that's different.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Let's consider the facts. Financial responsibility in relationships is a big topic. It's common for couples to split costs when living together. If one person can't pay their share, it's a problem. But here, the writer seems to have been the one consistently paying, even before moving in. The girlfriend's behavior of not contributing financially and expecting the writer to cover everything might be an issue. However, when they moved in together, splitting the rent would be a standard practice. The writer agreed to split initially, but then the girlfriend stopped contributing. \n\nThe writer paying full rent for her because of her debts might be seen as taking on more than their fair share, especially if the girlfriend's financial situation was known. The writer's argument is about fairness and their own financial stability. They mention that they were able to pay their own bills but had to penny-pinch. The girlfriend's response that it's a test is problematic because financial responsibility isn't a test that justifies someone else's debt. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the writer could have communicated better or set boundaries earlier. But given the girlfriend's pattern of not contributing and the writer's financial strain, cutting ties might be a reasonable decision. The girlfriend's expectation that the boyfriend should cover her debts isn't a healthy dynamic. \n\nSo, the writer's actions seem justified because they were trying to maintain a fair relationship and their own financial health. The girlfriend's behavior was exploitative. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
