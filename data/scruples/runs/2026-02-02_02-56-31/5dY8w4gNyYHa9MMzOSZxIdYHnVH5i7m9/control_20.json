Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend moved in together, initially splitting rent. Then she couldn't pay her share because of her debts, so he paid all the rent. She then says she can't pay at all again, and he kicks her out. She claims this was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations. The author feels he's been helping her financially but now his own situation is in trouble.\n\nFirst, financial responsibilities in relationships can be tricky. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to expect the guy to handle everything, which the author now finds unfair after living together. \n\nHe paid for rent and bills for six months, then she moved in and wasn't contributing equally. When she can't pay, he steps in, which creates a pattern. When she says she can't pay again, he decides to kick her out. He's now struggling financially because of it. \n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility. When two people live together, it's usually expected that both contribute to shared expenses. If one person is consistently unable to contribute, that can create issues. The author tried to have her pay back what she owed, but she didn't follow through. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it was a test for an accident scenario seems a bit manipulative. Using a hypothetical to justify not contributing in reality isn't fair. The author's frustration is valid because he's shouldering all the financial burden, which isn't sustainable.\n\nHowever, the author's approach of kicking her out might be seen as harsh. Instead of immediate eviction, he could have set clearer boundaries, like requiring her to contribute a certain amount or face consequences. But given the repeated issues and lack of reciprocity, his decision might be justified as a last resort.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to address the issue but didn't get a satisfactory response. So, while he could have handled it differently, the core issue is the unequal financial responsibility. The girlfriend's behavior, expecting him to cover everything without her contribution, is a significant part of the problem. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He's taking a stand for his own financial well-being after repeated attempts to make it work. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
