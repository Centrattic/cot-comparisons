Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. So first, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend moved in with him and initially didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries, only cleaning occasionally. Then when they moved in together, they split the rent for a few months. However, she started missing payments, leading to the author paying full rent to avoid issues. Now she claims she can't pay again, and he kicks her out. She later says it was a test for how he'd handle tough situations like an accident. The author is frustrated because he's shouldering all financial responsibility, and he's in a precarious situation himself.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that splitting the rent is fair when living together. If she can't contribute, maybe he's justified in ending the relationship. But on the other hand, relationships often involve compromises. However, the girlfriend's behavior of not paying her share and treating it as a \"test\" might be problematic. The author's frustration is valid because financial stress is a big issue in relationships. If she expected him to cover all her expenses without contributing, that's an imbalance. But kicking someone out of an apartment can be drastic. Maybe there were other solutions, like having a conversation about financial responsibilities earlier on. However, given her repeated failures to pay, the author might have felt it was necessary for his own stability. Also, the girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything might not be sustainable. The key points are mutual responsibility and communication. The author might not be in the wrong because he's setting boundaries for himself, especially after multiple instances of her not contributing. But if he didn't communicate his expectations clearly beforehand, maybe there's some fault there. However, based on the information given, the main issue is her not paying her share, so the author's decision could be justified.\n"
