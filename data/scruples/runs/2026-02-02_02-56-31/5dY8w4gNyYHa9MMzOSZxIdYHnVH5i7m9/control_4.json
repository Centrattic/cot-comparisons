Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he paid for most things from the start, like dinners, events, trips, and groceries. The girlfriend would occasionally pay and clean, but he felt it wasn't equal. He believes the guy should pay for most, but there should be some give and take. That part seems reasonable. Maybe they had an unspoken agreement where he was the primary financial supporter.\n\nThen, when they moved in together, they split the rent initially. But the girlfriend couldn't pay for a few months, leading the author to cover the rent. Now he's in a tough spot financially. The girlfriend's reasoning is that since she has her own debts, she can't contribute. The author is upset because he feels he's shouldering all financial responsibility while his own debts grow. He kicks her out after she refuses to pay, arguing that he's supposed to help her but she doesn't help him back.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and expectations. The author might feel exploited, especially since he's paying all the bills. He might be in the right if they had a mutual understanding that he would cover her expenses when she couldn't pay, but she should contribute when possible. However, the girlfriend's approach of expecting the guy to handle everything even when she can't pay might be problematic. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation. That's a bit concerning. Testing someone's limits by not contributing financially could be seen as manipulative. The author's reaction is justified if he feels the relationship is unfair. On the other hand, maybe he could have addressed the issue earlier or set clearer boundaries instead of allowing her to not pay rent for months. \n\nFinancial disagreements are common in relationships, but when one partner is consistently not contributing, it can lead to resentment. The author's decision to end the relationship might be a last resort after multiple attempts to resolve the issue. The girlfriend's mindset of expecting the guy to pay everything, even when she's able, is a red flag. However, the author's handling of the situation\u2014paying for everything without setting clear expectations\u2014might have contributed to the problem. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because he's taking responsibility for his own financial well-being and setting boundaries. The girlfriend's behavior of not contributing when possible and testing him is more of the issue. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
