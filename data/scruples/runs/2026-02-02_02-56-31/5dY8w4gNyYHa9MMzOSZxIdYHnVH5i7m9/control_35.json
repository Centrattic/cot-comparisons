Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup caused by financial issues. The author broke up with his girlfriend after she couldn't pay rent and he ended up paying all the bills, which put him in a tough financial spot. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their living arrangements. They moved in together, so splitting rent is standard. The girlfriend was unable to pay her share due to her debts, which the author found frustrating. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay most, but there should be some give and take. However, in this case, the girlfriend wasn't contributing as much as she should, leading to the author having to cover everything.\n\nThe key points are financial responsibility and mutual contribution in a relationship. In a shared living situation, both partners are usually expected to contribute to shared expenses unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent due to her own debts might be a valid issue, but if this was a recurring problem, the author might have had a right to expect some form of repayment or adjustment. \n\nThe author's response was to kick her out, which is a significant action. However, considering that the girlfriend was already staying in his apartment rent-free for six months before moving in together, and now she's consistently unable to contribute, the author might feel justified in ending the relationship. The girlfriend's attitude, where she expects the guy to handle everything without reciprocation, could be seen as one-sided.\n\nThe girlfriend later claims it was a test, which the author disagrees with. Testing someone in such a critical situation (like not paying rent) is risky and could be considered manipulative. The author's anger and decision to end the relationship might be a reaction to her lack of responsibility and the financial strain it caused.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual responsibility. If both parties are supposed to contribute, and one is unable or unwilling, the other has the right to set boundaries. The author's decision to end the relationship due to financial mismanagement and lack of reciprocity could be seen as justified. However, some might argue that he should have handled it differently, like giving her more time or negotiating a repayment plan instead of breaking up. But given the circumstances, the author's actions stem from his need to manage his own finances responsibly.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions were based on the need for fairness and financial stability in the relationship. The girlfriend's behavior shows a lack of contribution and responsibility, which the author rightly couldn't tolerate.\n"
