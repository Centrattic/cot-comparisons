Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out when she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was in a relationship where he paid most expenses, including rent when they moved in together. The girlfriend moved in, didn't pay her share, and now she can't pay rent due to her own debts. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When they tried splitting the rent again, she couldn't pay her part again. The author then decided to end the relationship and asked her to leave.\n\nNow, considering financial responsibility in a relationship. It's common for couples to split expenses when living together. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay most, but there should be some give and take. However, the girlfriend wasn't contributing as much as expected. When they moved in together, splitting rent is standard unless otherwise agreed. The fact that she couldn't pay her share, especially after he had already covered it once, might be a valid reason for him to reassess the relationship. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's attitude that the boyfriend should pay everything and that she doesn't need to help when he's in a tough spot is problematic. The author's frustration is understandable because he's supporting her financially without reciprocal support. The girlfriend's comment about it being a test to see how he'd react in a crisis seems dismissive and self-centered. \n\nFinancial stress is a major issue in relationships. The author made a tough decision to end the relationship to protect his own financial stability. While breaking up is always hard, the decision seems based on practical considerations rather than just anger. The key points are mutual financial responsibility and the girlfriend's inability to meet her obligations, leading to the author's justified action.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong because he made a decision based on the girlfriend's lack of financial contribution and her dismissive attitude towards his financial struggles.\n"
