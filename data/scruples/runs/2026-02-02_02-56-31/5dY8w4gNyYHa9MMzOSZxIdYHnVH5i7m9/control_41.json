Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The girlfriend moved into the author's apartment and wasn't paying rent for six months. The author mentions that she sometimes paid for things like groceries or cleaning, but it wasn't equal. Then when they moved in together, she said she couldn't pay rent due to her debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which affected his finances. After a few months, she again couldn't pay, and he kicked her out. She claimed it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nSo, the main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. The author expected some contribution from the girlfriend, especially since they were living together. He broke up because she wasn't contributing, which caused him financial strain. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nIn relationships, especially cohabiting ones, splitting costs is usually expected. The author might have set clear expectations, but if the girlfriend agreed to split the rent and then couldn't pay, that's a problem. However, the girlfriend's claim that it was a test complicates things. If she knew from the start that she couldn't pay and used it as a test, that's on her. But if she genuinely had financial issues beyond her control, maybe the author being too strict is the issue.\n\nThe author's actions seem to be about fairness and his own financial well-being. He's in a position where he can't afford to pay full rent alone, especially with his own debts. Kicking her out after she repeatedly couldn't pay might be a reasonable decision, especially if they had an agreement to split it. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her attitude (\"why do I have a boyfriend then?\") shows a lack of consideration for the author's situation.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have addressed the issue earlier instead of waiting until the financial strain became too much. But given that he tried to work it out and she wasn't forthcoming, his decision to end the relationship might be justified. Also, the girlfriend's test rationale could be insincere, suggesting she's using the situation to manipulate or see how he'd handle it, which isn't fair.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his own financial stability. The girlfriend's failure to contribute as agreed, especially after multiple warnings, supports his decision. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
