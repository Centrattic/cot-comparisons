Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend and kicked her out for not paying rent is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author mentions that from the start, he paid for most things, and she occasionally covered some expenses. When they moved in together, they split the rent initially, but then she stopped contributing due to her debts. He ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough spot financially. He tried to get her to pay back, but she refused, leading him to kick her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author felt the financial burden was unfair, especially since he was already helping with other expenses. When they moved in together, splitting rent seemed fair, but her inability to contribute led to conflict. The breaking point was when she couldn't pay again and he felt it was unsustainable.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it was a test for how he'd react in a tough situation might not be valid here. Financial responsibility in a relationship usually requires both parties to contribute where possible. If one can't meet their share, it's a problem that needs to be addressed. The author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as a last resort after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The author might have been taking on more than his fair share from the beginning, which could have set the stage for this conflict. But when they moved in together, splitting rent is a standard practice. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute after agreeing to split initially could be seen as her not honoring her part of the agreement. The author's frustration is understandable, especially when his own financial stability is at risk.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around splitting expenses in relationships. In some contexts, the man is expected to cover more, but mutual agreement is key. The author believed in the guy paying most but wanted some give and take. The girlfriend's lack of contribution, despite his efforts, might have crossed a line.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, if they were in a lease together, both are responsible for the rent. If she couldn't pay, he might be held responsible. But that's separate from the moral question here. The author's decision to end the relationship could be seen as necessary for his own well-being, especially if communication wasn't effective.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He did try to work it out, asked her to pay back, but she refused. His actions were a response to her not meeting her financial obligations. Given that, he might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
