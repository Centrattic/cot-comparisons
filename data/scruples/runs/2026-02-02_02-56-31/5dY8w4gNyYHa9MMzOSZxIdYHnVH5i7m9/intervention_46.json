Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. They had a situation where she moved in and didn't contribute much financially, even though she helped with cleaning sometimes. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent, leading him to pay everything and then kick her out when she couldn't pay again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of financial responsibility in a relationship. The user expected some give and take but felt the balance was off. The girlfriend didn't pay rent after a while and couldn't contribute, which caused financial strain. The user's reaction was to end the relationship and ask her to leave. \n\nIn many relationships, splitting expenses is a common arrangement. If one person isn't contributing, it can create tension. However, the user's response was pretty harsh\u2014kicking her out of the apartment. But maybe that's within his rights if they were living together as a couple and she agreed to split expenses. He had to pay full rent, which put him in a tough spot. \n\nHe mentions she said it was a test to see his reaction. That's a red flag for manipulation. If she was testing him, that's not a healthy dynamic. The user's reaction was to end the relationship, which could be justified if he felt the partnership was unequal. \n\nFinancial responsibility is important. If one partner isn't contributing and is causing financial strain, it's reasonable to reevaluate the relationship. The user might not be in the wrong, especially if they had an agreement about splitting costs. Kicking her out might be a necessary step to protect his finances. \n\nHowever, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out abruptly\u2014might be seen as extreme. But considering the context of financial pressure and lack of contribution, it's a valid decision. The key is whether there was an agreement and mutual understanding about responsibilities. If she agreed to split the rent and failed to do so, then the user isn't in the wrong for enforcing the agreement. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's mindset that the guy should pay for everything is problematic. Healthy relationships require mutual effort and compromise. If she wasn't willing to contribute, the user had every right to end the partnership. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The user acted to protect his financial stability and ended a relationship where financial responsibilities weren't met. The girlfriend's behavior was manipulative, so the user's reaction is justified.\n"
