Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that their girlfriend moved into his apartment in 2018 and lived there rent-free for six months. They moved in together and split the rent for a while. Then, the girlfriend started having financial issues and couldn't pay her share. The author took over the rent, which put his own finances at risk. Now, he's paying all the rent again, and she's not contributing. He kicked her out after she said she couldn't pay anything, and she claims it was a test to see his reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship regarding financial responsibilities. The author states that he believes the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. The girlfriend, however, seems to expect the guy to pay everything without contributing. This creates an imbalance. When they moved in together, splitting rent is a common arrangement, and the girlfriend not contributing after agreeing to split the rent could be seen as a breach of that agreement.\n\nThe author's decision to kick her out after she couldn't pay might be justified from a financial standpoint. He's put in his own financial stability at risk by covering all the rent, especially when the girlfriend hasn't contributed. The girlfriend's reasoning that it was a test for a potential future scenario (like an accident) seems dismissive of the actual financial strain the author is experiencing. The author's frustration is understandable because financial responsibilities in a relationship require mutual effort and communication.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's financial struggles might not be entirely her fault. She mentioned her own debts and bills, which could be legitimate issues. But the author also mentions that she didn't contribute equally in terms of chores or payments even before moving in together. This suggests a pattern of one-sided contributions.\n\nThe key here is whether the author handled the situation appropriately. Breaking up and kicking someone out for financial reasons can be harsh, but if there was a mutual agreement to split expenses and the other party isn't fulfilling their part, it's a valid reason. The author did warn her, asked for repayment, and gave her chances to contribute. When she repeatedly failed to meet her end, the author made a difficult but necessary decision to protect his own financial health.\n\nIn conclusion, while both parties might have some responsibility\u2014like better communication and financial planning\u2014the author's decision to break up seems justified given the repeated failures to meet agreed-upon financial responsibilities. The girlfriend's test explanation is a poor justification and overlooks the real impact on the author's financial situation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
