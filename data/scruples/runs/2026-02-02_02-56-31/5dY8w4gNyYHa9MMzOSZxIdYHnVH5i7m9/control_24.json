Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup because the ex-girlfriend couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that from the start, he paid for most things\u2014dinner, events, trips, groceries. She paid occasionally and cleaned sometimes, but he felt it wasn't equal. He's okay with the guy paying most, but some give and take is needed. Then they moved in together, and she wasn't paying rent for months. He paid the full rent, which affected his finances. Now she can't pay again, and she's not helping, so he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see his reaction in a tough situation.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, he's being responsible by splitting the rent when they moved in together. Not paying her share is a big issue because it's unfair and puts financial strain on him. If she's in a position where she can't pay, maybe they should have discussed moving out or adjusting the arrangement. He's trying to handle his own debts and can't afford to cover hers. His actions are about financial responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have expected support, especially if she was in debt. But expecting a partner to cover all expenses without any contribution isn't fair in a balanced relationship. The author might have enabled this behavior by not setting boundaries earlier. However, when they moved in together, splitting costs is usually expected. The fact that she didn't contribute her share and then justified it as a test could be seen as irresponsible or manipulative.\n\nAnother angle: when they moved in together, they agreed to split rent. Her inability to pay should have been a red flag earlier. The author's frustration is valid because he's shouldering more than his share, which is unsustainable. Kicking her out to avoid further financial strain is a practical decision. However, maybe there was a lack of communication earlier. But given the situation, his actions seem reasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning about it being a test is problematic. Using a potential accident as a justification for not paying rent now doesn't hold up. Real emergencies can't be planned for, but expecting someone to cover all costs without reciprocation is unfair. The author isn't wrong to set boundaries here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's taking responsibility for his finances and setting boundaries in a relationship that's becoming one-sided. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
