  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking up and kicking my girlfriend out of my apartment because she couldn\u2019t pay rent?\nShe\u2019s in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything, and against my better judgment I went with it. Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they mention that the girlfriend expected the guy to pay for everything, which the user was okay with but felt it wasn't equal. He contributed a lot to dinners, events, groceries, etc., while she helped occasionally. Then, after moving in together, she didn't pay rent for a few months, saying she had her own debts. The user paid the rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out, and she said it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nThe user is wondering if they were wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider financial responsibility in relationships. Typically, when two people live together, splitting costs is expected. If one partner can't contribute, it can create tension. The user was paying for everything, which led to financial strain. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle all expenses and her inability to meet her share of the rent could be seen as unfair. The user's reaction, while forceful, might be justified given the financial stress and lack of reciprocity. The girlfriend's test explanation doesn't seem valid because expecting a partner to cover all expenses without any contribution isn't healthy. So, the user probably isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
