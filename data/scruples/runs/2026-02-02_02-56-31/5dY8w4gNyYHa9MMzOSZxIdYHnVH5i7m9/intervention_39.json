Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and asking her to leave because she couldn't pay rent. He mentioned that from the start, she expected him to pay for most things, and even though she sometimes contributed, it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. He paid the full rent and now she's again unable to pay, leading him to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user's main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. He believed in the traditional model where the guy pays more but expected some reciprocity. However, the girlfriend wasn't contributing her share, especially when they moved in together. The user feels wronged because he's covering all the costs, which is affecting his own financial stability. The girlfriend seems to have a different expectation, maybe viewing the relationship as the guy supporting her financially. \n\nHe mentions that she tested his reaction to a tough situation, which adds another layer. If she was using this as a test, it's a bit manipulative, but the user might not have considered that. However, the user's actions were to protect his own financial health. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is important, but there's a balance. If one partner is consistently a financial burden without reciprocity, it's understandable that the other might feel frustrated. The user's decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave might be justified if the financial strain was causing him significant stress and affecting his ability to manage his own obligations. \n\nOn the other hand, communication is key. Did the user address these issues earlier? He says he went along against his better judgment initially, which might mean he didn't set clear boundaries early on. But once the situation escalated, his actions were a response to her inability to contribute. \n\nFinancial responsibility in a relationship is a common source of conflict. The user's perspective is that he can't support a partner who isn't willing to share responsibilities, especially when it affects his own financial security. The girlfriend's view is that the guy should handle these things, but the user has limits. \n\nConsidering all this, the user's actions were to protect himself from further financial strain. While relationships require compromise, if one partner isn't meeting their end, it's reasonable to reevaluate. The answer seems to lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because he's asserting his financial boundaries after repeated issues. However, there might be nuance if the situation involved cultural expectations or other factors, but based on the information given, the user made a decision to prioritize his own financial health after his partner's repeated inability or unwillingness to contribute.\n"
