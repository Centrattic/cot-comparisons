Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. They provided the context, and I need to answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user was in a relationship where they paid for most things, and the girlfriend didn't contribute equally. Then when they moved in together, she couldn't pay rent, leading to him kicking her out. She later claims she was testing how he'd react to a tough situation.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship, mutual effort, and communication. The user felt they were carrying the financial burden, and when their partner couldn't pay, they ended things. The girlfriend's argument that it was a test complicates things, but maybe she's trying to justify her actions.\n\nFinancial independence in relationships is important. Both partners should contribute to shared expenses. If one partner is consistently not contributing, it can cause strain. The user tried splitting rent initially, but when the girlfriend couldn't pay, he had to cover it, which put him in a tough spot. His decision to end the relationship might be seen as standing up for his own financial health.\n\nThe girlfriend's test explanation might not excuse her not paying. Testing how someone reacts in a crisis isn't a valid reason to avoid responsibility. The user has a right to expect some financial contribution when living together, especially if they're in a committed relationship.\n\nHowever, the user's approach was to kick her out immediately. Maybe there was a lack of communication or attempts to resolve the issue before breaking up. But given the repeated issues with her not paying her share, the user might feel justified in protecting their own finances.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were trying to maintain a balance, and when it wasn't possible, they acted to protect their own situation. The girlfriend's behavior of not contributing and testing their reaction is problematic. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
