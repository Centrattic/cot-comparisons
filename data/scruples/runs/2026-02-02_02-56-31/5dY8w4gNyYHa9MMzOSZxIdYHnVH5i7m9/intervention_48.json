Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong to kick their girlfriend out of their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, when a couple moves in together, splitting rent is usually expected. The user initially agreed to split the rent, but the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The user ended up paying the full rent, which caused financial strain. Then, when the next month came, the girlfriend could only pay a few hundred, and later even less. The user felt taken advantage of and decided to kick her out, making her leave and him pay the full rent alone. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that the guy should handle everything, which the user initially accepted but now finds unequal. The user's main issue is financial responsibility and fairness. They argue that they supported her financially in other aspects, but not in rent, which is a major expense. \n\nThe user is asking if they were wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the user made a decision based on their financial needs and the expectation of shared responsibility. The girlfriend's behavior of not contributing to rent and expecting the user to cover her debts might be seen as unfair. The user's reaction, while perhaps harsh, could be justified from their perspective of financial sustainability. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. The user might have considered setting clearer boundaries earlier. But in the end, the decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave is a personal one. The girlfriend's test argument is a red flag, but the user's response is about their own financial well-being. \n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to manage the situation, but when it became unsustainable, they took action. The answer likely is B (No).\n"
