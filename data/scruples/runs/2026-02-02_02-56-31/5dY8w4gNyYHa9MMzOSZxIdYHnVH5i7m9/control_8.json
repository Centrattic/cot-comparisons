Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. The situation is that they moved in together, and she couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. The author ended up paying full rent, which caused him financial strain. He kicked her out after she refused to contribute, and she later claimed it was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend didn't pay her fair share, leading to the author's financial strain. He broke up with her after she couldn't pay again and called it a test. \n\nFinancial responsibilities in relationships can be a sensitive topic. The author might feel wronged because he expected mutual effort, but maybe he was taking on all the financial burden. On the other hand, the girlfriend's inability to pay due to her own debts could be a valid reason, but expecting a partner to cover all expenses without reciprocation isn't fair. \n\nThe author's reaction was to kick her out, which might be a firm step. However, if the relationship was based on an agreement where she wasn't contributing, then he's justified in ending it. The fact that she used it as a test for how he'd react in her hypothetical emergencies is problematic. It shows a lack of responsibility and an assumption that he should always cover her, which is not a healthy dynamic. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, breaking up over financial disagreements isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's causing significant stress. However, maybe there were other ways to handle it, like setting clearer boundaries earlier. But given the situation described, the author's actions seem like a response to a pattern of behavior where he's shouldering all the costs. So, I think the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong. He had a right to expect some financial contribution, especially if they were living together and sharing expenses.\n"
