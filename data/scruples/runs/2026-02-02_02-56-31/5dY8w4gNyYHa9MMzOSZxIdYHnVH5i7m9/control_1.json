Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they moved in together and agreed to split the rent. The girlfriend initially paid her share but then couldn't pay due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which put him in financial trouble. Now, she's saying she can't pay anything again, and the author kicks her out. The girlfriend claims it was a test to see how he'd handle a tough situation, like an accident.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author believes in the guy paying most things but expects some reciprocity. The girlfriend didn't contribute equally over time, especially after moving in together. The author's decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave is based on financial strain and the lack of contribution from her side.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around splitting expenses in relationships. In many cases, couples do split costs, especially rent, when living together. If one person consistently isn't contributing and it's causing financial stress, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries. However, the author's tone is pretty confrontational (\"Get the fuck out\"), which might be seen as harsh. But given the context of financial pressure and the girlfriend's lack of accountability, maybe it's justified.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's attitude where she expects the guy to handle all financial issues without reciprocation is problematic. The author tried to accommodate her before, but now he's at a breaking point. Her treating it as a test is dismissive and doesn't address the real issues of responsibility and fairness.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his financial well-being after repeated issues. The girlfriend's actions contributed significantly to the situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
