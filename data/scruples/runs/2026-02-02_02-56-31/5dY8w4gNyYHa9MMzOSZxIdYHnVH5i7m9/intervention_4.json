  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking up and kicking my girlfriend out of my apartment because she couldn\u2019t pay rent?\nShe\u2019s in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything, and against my better judgment I went with it. Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after breaking up with their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been in a relationship where they paid for most things, even after she moved in. Then, when living together, she couldn't contribute to rent. The user paid the full amount, leading to financial strain. The girlfriend's reasoning was that the guy should pay, and she even said it was a test. The user kicked her out.\n\nSo, the main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. The user believes in the guy paying most, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend didn't contribute, which caused the user to feel taken advantage of. They split the rent initially, but then she couldn't pay. The user ended up paying all, leading to financial stress. The girlfriend's attitude and the \"test\" comment probably pushed the user over the edge.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if both are living in a place, splitting costs is typical unless agreed otherwise. The user tried to compromise initially, but the girlfriend's inability or unwillingness to contribute created a problem. The user's reaction was to end the relationship and the shared living situation, which seems reasonable if the girlfriend isn't meeting her financial responsibilities. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal belief about relationships where the guy is expected to pay. However, even then, expecting some contribution is normal. The girlfriend's behavior might have been manipulative or not honest about her ability to pay. \n\nThe user's decision to end the lease situation and kick her out could be justified if there was an agreement to split expenses and she didn't hold up her end. The financial strain and lack of reciprocity likely played a role. The girlfriend's test explanation might be a way to justify her actions, but the user's reaction of frustration and needing to manage their own finances makes sense.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong. They tried to be fair, but the girlfriend's lack of contribution and attitude made the situation unsustainable. The user's actions were to protect their own financial well-being.\n"
