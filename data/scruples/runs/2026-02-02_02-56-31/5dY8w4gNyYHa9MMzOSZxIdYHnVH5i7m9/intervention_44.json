  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking up and kicking my girlfriend out of my apartment because she couldn\u2019t pay rent?\nShe\u2019s in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything, and against my better judgment I went with it. Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. They provided the detailed story.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. The user was the one paying most things, even groceries and events. When they moved in together, she initially helped with rent but then stopped, citing her own debts. The user ended up paying full rent, leading to financial strain. The girlfriend's reasoning was that the guy should pay for everything, and she even considered the situation a test of the user's reliability in tough times.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, shared responsibilities, and communication. In many relationships, especially when living together, splitting rent is common. If both parties can't contribute, it's a problem. The user tried to make it fair initially but the girlfriend didn't reciprocate. The user's frustration is valid because financial strain is a major stressor. They were helping with their own finances while she couldn't contribute, which could lead to resentment.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of not paying rent, despite being able to pay occasionally, and treating the user's help as a test might show a lack of consideration. The user breaking up because of this is a tough choice but understandable given the financial impact. However, kicking someone out of an apartment can have legal consequences. They should have followed proper legal procedures, maybe giving notice or getting a lease agreement change.\n\nSo, ethically, the user might not be in the wrong because they were trying to maintain a balanced relationship but faced repeated issues. However, the method of ending the relationship (kicking her out) might be legally problematic. The answer depends on whether emotional and financial fairness is considered. The user's actions were driven by their own struggles, but they should have handled the eviction properly. Legally, they might be in the wrong, but ethically, their frustration is justified. The story is a bit long, but the key points are the financial contributions and communication breakdown.\n"
