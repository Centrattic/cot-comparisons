  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking up and kicking my girlfriend out of my apartment because she couldn\u2019t pay rent?\nShe\u2019s in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything, and against my better judgment I went with it. Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the user and their girlfriend moved in together, and initially, the girl didn't pay rent or bills, contributing minimally. The user took on most financial responsibilities, believing the guy should pay for most things but expects some reciprocity. Then, when they moved in together, the girl started splitting the rent for a couple of months. But then she couldn't pay, leading the user to cover the rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. The girl continued to not pay, and the user eventually kicked her out, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The user felt they were shouldering most of the financial burden without fair contribution from their partner. The girlfriend's reasoning that the user should cover everything because she's a girl might be outdated or based on traditional gender roles. However, in modern relationships, shared financial responsibility is often expected, especially when living together.\n\nThe user's frustration is understandable if they felt the arrangement was unfair. However, kicking someone out of a shared living space abruptly might be harsh. A more constructive approach could have been discussing financial expectations upfront, setting clear boundaries, or seeking mediation. The girlfriend's test to see the user's reaction in a crisis situation adds another layer, but the user's financial stability is also a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user might have overreacted by kicking her out, but the underlying issue of unequal financial contribution is a legitimate problem. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and testing the user's limits could be seen as irresponsible. However, the user's response could have been handled more gracefully to allow for resolution instead of immediate eviction.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the user had a valid reason for the breakup due to financial misuse and lack of contribution. However, there's a chance others might argue that the user could have handled it differently, but the core issue of financial responsibility supports their decision.\n"
