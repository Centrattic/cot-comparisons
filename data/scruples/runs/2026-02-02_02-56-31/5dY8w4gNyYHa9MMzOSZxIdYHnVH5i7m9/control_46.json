Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author who broke up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved in and initially didn't pay rent or bills. The author covered everything, which he's okay with, but there's an imbalance. Then, when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share. He covered the rent, which put him in a tight financial spot. She later said she couldn't pay again, and he kicked her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility and communication. The author is frustrated because he's shouldering all the costs, and she's not contributing. He decided to end the relationship when she couldn't meet her part. But the question is whether he's wrong for doing that.\n\nFinancial expectations in a relationship are a big deal. When two people live together, splitting rent is usually expected. If one can't pay, that's a problem. The author tried to split the rent but then she couldn't pay. He covered it, but now she's not helping. He's in a tough spot financially and decides to end the relationship to avoid further strain. \n\nHowever, there's the part where she said it was a test. That might indicate she wasn't being honest, but the author might not have known that. Was it fair for her to test his response? But the author's reaction\u2014kicking her out\u2014could be seen as a way to enforce boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author didn't address the issue gradually. Maybe he should have had more conversations about financial expectations before moving in together. But he did mention that they split rent initially, and she couldn't pay later. If she's in debt, perhaps she didn't communicate her financial situation upfront. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. So, if we consider that financial responsibilities are a key part of a relationship, especially when living together, and that the author tried to be fair but couldn't handle the ongoing stress, then his decision might be justified. Alternatively, if he should have been more understanding or worked out a payment plan, he might be in the wrong. \n\nBut the main issue here is that she's not contributing to shared expenses, which is a significant stressor. The author made a decision to end the relationship to protect his financial stability. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that kicking someone out over financial issues without giving them more time could be harsh. But given the context of repeated failures to pay and the strain it's causing, the author's actions seem reasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test to see his reaction in a crisis is a red flag. That suggests she was planning this beforehand, which the author didn't know. But even so, the author had to make a practical decision based on his current reality. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries to protect his financial well-being, especially after repeated issues. However, there's a nuance here where communication and gradual steps could have been taken before breaking up. But given the situation as presented, the author's actions are defensible.\n"
