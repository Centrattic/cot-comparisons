Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, the situation: The writer and their girlfriend moved in together, split the rent initially, but she couldn't pay her share later. The writer ended up covering the rent, which caused them financial strain. The girlfriend even said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nThe writer is upset because they feel like the financial burden is entirely on them. They mention that they had been paying for most things before she moved in, but she didn't contribute equally. Now, with her not paying rent, they can't manage their own bills and loans. The breaking point was when she said \"why do I need a boyfriend then?\" implying she expects him to take care of her financially.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? Well, financial responsibility in relationships is a big topic. If two people live together, splitting costs is common. If one person can't contribute, it can create tension. The writer tried to split the rent but when she couldn't pay, he took over, which put him in a bad spot. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting him to handle everything seems problematic. The writer's reaction\u2014ending the relationship and asking her to leave\u2014might be harsh, but given the financial strain and her attitude, it's understandable. \n\nBut maybe there's a gray area. Did the writer consider other options, like adjusting the split or helping her with her debts? However, the key point is that the relationship's financial imbalance was a major issue. The girlfriend's statement about it being a test shows a lack of consideration for the writer's situation. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the situation shows a pattern of financial irresponsibility from the girlfriend, and the writer acted to protect their own financial stability.\n"
