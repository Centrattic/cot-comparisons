Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, they mention that she's in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything. The user agreed to that initially, covering most expenses like dinners, trips, etc., but felt it wasn't equal. Then, she moved in and didn't pay rent for six months, only cleaning occasionally. When they moved in together, they split rent at first, but she couldn't pay anymore. The user paid the full rent, which put them in a tough spot financially. Now, she can't pay again and says, \"Why do I have a boyfriend then?\" leading the user to kick her out.\n\nThe user is conflicted because she claims it was a test, thinking about how they'd react in an emergency. The user is wondering if they overreacted.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, splitting rent is usual when two people live together. The user might have felt they were being taken advantage of, especially if they were already paying for a lot before. The girlfriend's inability to contribute financially, despite her debts, could be seen as a lack of responsibility. The user's decision to end things might be about their own financial strain and the imbalance in the relationship.\n\nHowever, relationships involve communication and compromise. If the user didn't address the financial issues before moving in together, maybe they share some responsibility. But given the situation, where the user is now struggling financially because of the girlfriend's lack of contribution, it's understandable they'd be upset. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything without reciprocity is problematic.\n\nThe key points are mutual responsibility in financial matters and the communication (or lack thereof) about expectations. The user might feel wronged because the relationship wasn't balanced. While it's good to support each other, one person shouldn't bear all the financial burden. The user's reaction, though harsh, stems from their own financial stress and the imbalance.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Probably not. They made a choice to end the relationship due to unsustainable financial strain and lack of cooperation. The girlfriend's behavior seems to be the main issue here.\n"
