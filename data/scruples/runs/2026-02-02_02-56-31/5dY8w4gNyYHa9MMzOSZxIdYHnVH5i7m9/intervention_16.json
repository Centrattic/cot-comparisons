Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The user is asking if they did the right thing by breaking up and asking her to leave.\n\nFirst, let me go through the details. The user and his girlfriend were in a relationship where he paid for most things, including rent after she moved in. He mentions that she occasionally paid for some things and cleaned, but he felt it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, she couldn't pay rent because of her debts, and he ended up covering it, which strained his finances. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibilities in a relationship. The user believed that the guy should pay for most things, but he also expected some give and take. When it came to splitting the rent, he thought it should be shared, but she couldn't contribute, leading to his financial stress. He decided to end the relationship because he felt he couldn't keep covering her part.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, it's common for couples to split expenses when living together, especially if both are residing in the home. However, the user had already been covering her expenses before they moved in together, which might have set a precedent. The girlfriend might have been relying on him financially, and when the situation became unsustainable, he decided to end it.\n\nThe user argues that he's not against paying for things but expects some reciprocity. When she couldn't reciprocate, especially in a shared living situation where responsibilities are typically split, his decision to end the relationship seems reasonable. The girlfriend's explanation that she was testing his reaction in a tough situation might not justify her lack of contribution, as real-life situations like accidents are different from ongoing financial irresponsibility.\n\nFinancial compatibility is crucial in relationships, and if one partner can't meet shared financial obligations, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship. The user's actions were to protect his own financial stability, which is understandable. He didn't force her to move in or agree to cover her bills without her contribution. When she couldn't meet her part, ending the relationship to avoid further financial strain is a responsible decision.\n\nSo, based on this, the user isn't in the wrong. He made a tough call when it became clear that the financial imbalance was harmful to him. The answer should be B.\n"
