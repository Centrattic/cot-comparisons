Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. The situation started with her expecting him to pay for most things, which he did, but she contributed minimally. When they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share, leading to financial strain on him.\n\nFirst, financial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. If both partners are supposed to contribute to shared expenses but one consistently can't or won't, that's a problem. He mentions she helped occasionally, but it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, splitting rent seems standard. Her inability to pay led him to cover it, which he's now struggling with financially.\n\nHe's upset because he feels it's unfair to bear all the financial burden, especially when his own debts are a concern. The girlfriend's attitude that the boyfriend should always pay might not be healthy in a partnership. Relationships ideally require mutual support, but there should be balance. If one person is constantly relying on the other without reciprocation, it's a red flag.\n\nHer response that she considered it a test for emergencies is problematic. Using her partner's financial generosity as a test without prior discussion seems manipulative. The user's reaction of ending the relationship might be harsh, but if the financial issues are irreconcilable and there's no willingness from her to contribute, he's justified in prioritizing his own well-being. \n\nHowever, the way he handled it by kicking her out could be seen as extreme. Communication might have been better before taking such a drastic step. But given the ongoing issues and her lack of accountability, his decision might be understandable. The key is whether the financial arrangement was agreed upon and if she had a legitimate expectation for him to cover everything.\n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his financial stability and boundaries, which is important. The girlfriend's behavior shows a lack of responsibility and respect for his situation. So the answer is B.\n"
