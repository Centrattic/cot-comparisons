Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out of their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial responsibilities in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that they paid for most things before moving in together, but there was an imbalance. When they moved in together, she started not paying rent, which caused financial strain. The user ended the relationship and asked her to leave.\n\nThe key points here are about financial expectations in a relationship. Some people might argue that in a committed relationship, especially when living together, financial responsibilities should be shared. However, the user states that they believed the guy should pay for most things, but there needs to be some give and take. The girlfriend didn't contribute financially, leading to the user's frustration.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning was that the boyfriend should handle her expenses, which the user found unfair. The final breaking point was when the girlfriend couldn't pay rent again and even suggested it was a test of the user's commitment. The user felt they were taking on too much and couldn't sustain it, so they ended the relationship.\n\nNow, considering if the user is in the wrong. Legally, if the apartment is in the user's name, they might have the right to ask her to leave. Emotionally and ethically, it's about shared responsibilities. The user might not be in the wrong because they set boundaries and couldn't continue in a situation where their financial stability was at risk. Relationships require mutual respect and contribution, and if one partner isn't contributing, it's reasonable to end it. However, some might argue that support in tough times is part of a relationship, but the user felt it was one-sided. The girlfriend's test comment might indicate she didn't take the situation seriously, which the user took as a sign of irresponsibility. So, the answer is likely B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
