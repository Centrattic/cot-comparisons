Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about breaking up and kicking the girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author mentions that he was paying for most things during the relationship, including dinners, events, trips, and groceries. When they moved in together, she initially helped with cleaning but not equally. Then, she couldn't pay rent for a few months, leading him to pay the full amount. He tried to get her to pay back, but she didn't, and when he asked again, she said she couldn't pay anything, which he found unacceptable. He then asked her to leave.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The author believed that while he should pay for most things, there should be some give and take. However, when they moved in together, splitting rent is a common practice, and she not contributing financially led to strain. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning for not paying rent was due to her own debts and bills. She also mentioned it was a test for how he'd react in tough situations. The author felt that by taking on all the financial burden, he was being unfair, and his own financial stability was at risk. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. In relationships, financial expectations can vary, but mutual support and communication are important. The author tried to work with her, allowing her to pay some and asking for repayment. When she couldn't meet her responsibilities, he decided to end the relationship to protect his finances. \n\nIs it fair to kick someone out for not paying rent? If they're cohabiting, typically both parties contribute. If she couldn't meet her share and there was no agreement otherwise, the author might have a right to prioritize his financial health. However, relationships also involve support during tough times. The girlfriend's test argument might be selfish, but it's possible she was in a difficult financial situation. \n\nThe author's actions were extreme, but given the context of her not contributing and the financial strain, it's understandable. He might not be in the wrong if the relationship was causing mutual stress and she wasn't fulfilling her part. However, breaking up over financial issues can be complex. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would hinge on whether the author acted reasonably under the circumstances. Since he tried to work it out and she wasn't contributing, leading to his own financial problems, he might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
