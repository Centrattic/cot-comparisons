  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking up and kicking my girlfriend out of my apartment because she couldn\u2019t pay rent?\nShe\u2019s in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything, and against my better judgment I went with it. Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup where the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent when they moved in together. The user wants to know if he's the asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. They moved in together, split rent initially. Then she couldn't pay her share because of her debts. He paid the full rent and now she's not contributing again. He kicks her out, saying he can't keep covering for her finances. She later says it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations, like an accident, but he sees it as different.\n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility, expectations in a relationship, and mutual support. The guy feels he's been helping her out with expenses, but the support isn't equal. When they move in together, splitting rent is a given. When she can't pay, he covers it, but she doesn't reciprocate. He's in a precarious financial situation because of this, so he kicks her out. She seems to think he should just cover her without question, even in normal times.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, it's important to have mutual agreement on financial responsibilities. If they moved in together, they should have discussed splitting costs. If she couldn't pay her share and that was causing strain, maybe there are solutions like renegotiating the split, her taking on other responsibilities, or setting boundaries. However, he's already tried splitting the rent and she couldn't handle her part, so he's left in a tough spot.\n\nHe's also mentioned that he paid for most things before they moved in together, which might have set an expectation. But when moving in together, it's reasonable to expect splitting expenses. She moving in rent-free for six months and then splitting after seems unfair if she's not contributing. His frustration is about the imbalance, and when she can't pay, he's forced to cover, leading to his decision to end the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that he should cover her because she's in debt might not be valid if they had an agreement to split rent. Testing his reaction by creating a scenario where she can't pay might be a red flag about her approach to responsibility. He's right in wanting to protect his own finances, especially when hers are in disarray.\n\nHowever, maybe there was a communication breakdown. If he didn't set clear expectations about rent and financial responsibilities from the start, that could be an issue. But given that she moved in and then expected him to pay everything, his decision to end the relationship because he couldn't afford to keep supporting her financially seems justified. He's prioritizing his own financial stability, which is important.\n\nSo, considering all that, the guy isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing up for his financial well-being after she couldn't meet her obligations. The girlfriend might be in the wrong for expecting him to cover her without contributing. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
