Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user and their girlfriend moved in together, and initially, they split the rent. The girlfriend started not paying her share because of her own financial issues. The author paid the full rent, which put them in a tough spot financially. The girlfriend didn't help with the rent again this month and even said, \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" when confronted. The author then kicked her out. The girlfriend claims she was testing how the author would react to a tough situation, like an accident.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were justified. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, sharing living expenses is a common expectation in a relationship, especially when two people live together. If both parties are supposed to contribute, not paying one's share can be a valid reason for conflict. The author mentions that even before moving in together, the girlfriend expected them to pay for most things, and the girlfriend didn't contribute equally even during the dating phase. This could indicate a pattern of behavior where the girlfriend didn't share financial responsibilities.\n\nHowever, relationships also involve emotional support and understanding. The girlfriend's financial situation might be due to her own debts and bills. The author might not have considered financial hardship as a reason for her inability to pay. Also, the girlfriend's comment about it being a test for how the author would react to her hypothetical accident suggests that she might have been testing his support, which is perhaps unfair but not entirely uncommon in relationships.\n\nThe author's reaction was to kick her out of the apartment. That's a drastic step. Was it necessary? If the author communicated their expectations beforehand and the girlfriend was aware that contributing to rent was a condition of living together, then the author might have a case. However, if the author didn't set clear boundaries from the start and the girlfriend had a history of not contributing equally, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a sensitive issue. The author might feel that they are shouldering all the financial burden, which can lead to resentment. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have genuine financial struggles. The key point here is whether the author had a prior agreement about splitting responsibilities. If there was an expectation that both would contribute, the author isn't wrong for enforcing that. But if the situation was more flexible, the author might have overreacted.\n\nAnother angle is the communication aspect. The author mentions that they talked about it, and the girlfriend didn't take it seriously. The \"test\" comment adds another layer\u2014maybe the girlfriend was trying to see if the author would support her in times of need, which is a different scenario. However, the author can't be expected to support someone's financial issues indefinitely without any reciprocity.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is in a position where their financial stability is at risk because of the girlfriend's inability to contribute. The decision to kick her out might be seen as a way to protect their own financial health. However, the abruptness and the harsh language (\"Get the fuck out\") might be seen as harsh, but the core issue is financial responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were a result of their partner not meeting agreed-upon responsibilities, leading to a breakdown in the partnership. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
