Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and asking her to leave because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user and his girlfriend moved in together, and initially split the rent. Then she started not paying her share, claiming she couldn't afford it. He ended up paying all the rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When he confronted her, she said it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis. He's now kicking her out, and the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, from what I know about relationships and living arrangements, splitting costs is a common expectation. If one person is contributing significantly more financially, that could be a problem. The user mentions that he paid for most things even before they moved in together, expecting some give and take, but felt it wasn't equal. Then, when they moved in together, the financial imbalance continued, which led to the breakup.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it was a test is problematic. Using a relationship as a test for how someone handles financial strain isn't responsible. Relationships require mutual support and compromise. If she knew she couldn't pay her share due to her debts, it's her responsibility to communicate that and find a solution together. Instead, she seems to expect the user to cover her costs without contributing, which isn't fair.\n\nThe user's decision to end the relationship because of the financial imbalance might be harsh, but it's a personal choice. If the financial strain is causing stress and the other person isn't willing to contribute, ending the relationship could be justified. However, some might argue that he should have had a conversation and tried to resolve the issue before kicking her out, especially if there's a lease agreement involved. But considering the ongoing issues and her lack of willingness to contribute, his actions might be seen as a last resort.\n\nSo, based on the information, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior contributed to the problem, and the user is standing his ground by enforcing financial equality. However, the way he handled the breakup might be seen as extreme by some. But overall, the responsibility for the situation isn't solely on him. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he is not in the wrong).\n"
