Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation is that she moved in, didn't contribute much, and then when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share. He ended up paying everything, which caused financial strain for him. She then said she couldn't pay anything again, leading to him asking her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. He was paying for most things before they moved in together. Maybe there was an imbalance from the start. When they moved in, splitting rent is a common expectation, but she couldn't pay. He tried to let her pay some, but she didn't follow through. He ended up paying full rent again, which is causing him financial issues. She then claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nHe's asking if he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should think about fairness in relationships, financial responsibilities, and communication. In healthy relationships, both partners should contribute to shared expenses. If one is consistently unable or unwilling to contribute, it can cause strain. The user might feel he's justified in ending the relationship when there's a clear expectation of shared responsibility. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be a point of contention. Was there an agreement? Did he communicate his expectations clearly? Also, her claim that it was a test is a bit of a red flag. Testing someone's reaction in such a serious matter isn't a good approach. But the user's frustration is understandable given the financial burden.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might not be in the wrong. He tried to compromise, but when she couldn't meet her share, he took action to protect his own financial stability. However, the method of kicking her out might be seen as harsh, but given the context, it could be justified as self-preservation. The answer might lean towards B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
