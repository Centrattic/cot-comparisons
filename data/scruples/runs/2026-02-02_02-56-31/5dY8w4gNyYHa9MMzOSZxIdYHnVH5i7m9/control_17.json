Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. They broke up with their girlfriend and kicked her out of their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial responsibilities in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author mentions that the girlfriend moved in and initially didn't pay rent or bills, only cleaning occasionally. Then, when they moved in together, they split the rent for a few months. However, the girlfriend later couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. The girlfriend continued to not pay, and when confronted, she said it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis. The author then kicked her out.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Financial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. The key points here are mutual agreement on financial matters, communication, and fairness. The author expected the girlfriend to contribute to rent, but she didn't. The author covered the rent, which caused them financial strain. The girlfriend's argument that it was a test seems like a justification, but it's not a valid reason not to pay rent. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to contribute, especially when they're living together. If one person is consistently not pulling their weight financially, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries. However, kicking someone out abruptly without a plan for them might be harsh. But given the girlfriend's lack of contribution and the author's financial stress, the decision to end the relationship and the living arrangement makes sense. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior\u2014using the relationship as a test\u2014shows a lack of responsibility and consideration. The author had to take care of their own debts and bills, which were exacerbated by covering the girlfriend's share. The author's actions were a response to ongoing issues, not just a single incident. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They addressed the problem when it arose, tried to work it out, and when the situation didn't improve, they took action to protect their own financial well-being. The girlfriend's attitude and lack of contribution justify the author's decision. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
