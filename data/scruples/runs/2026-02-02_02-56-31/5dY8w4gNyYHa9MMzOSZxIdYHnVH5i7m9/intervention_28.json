Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. They've given a detailed backstory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial arrangement. They mentioned that the girl moved in and for six months didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. Then when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share. The user ended up paying the full rent again, which strained their finances. The girl's reasoning was that the guy should pay, and she even said \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" when confronted. The user finally kicked her out, and she claims it was a test.\n\nSo, from the user's perspective, they felt exploited financially. They took care of most expenses, and when they tried to split costs, the girlfriend couldn't or wouldn't contribute. The user's breaking point was when she couldn't pay again, leading to them ending the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFinancial responsibilities in relationships can be tricky. If both people are living in the same place, splitting the rent and bills is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. The user might have felt they were doing more than their fair share, but maybe they should have set clearer boundaries earlier. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014moving in, not paying rent, and expecting the user to cover everything\u2014could be seen as unfair. \n\nThe user's decision to end the relationship because of financial strain is a personal choice. It's possible they're not in the wrong because they were protecting their own financial stability. However, some might argue that they should have addressed the issue before reaching that point. The girlfriend's test explanation seems like an excuse, which could justify the user's reaction. \n\nConsidering all this, the user's actions seem justified. They were in a situation where their financial well-being was at risk, and they took action to protect themselves. So the answer would lean towards B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
