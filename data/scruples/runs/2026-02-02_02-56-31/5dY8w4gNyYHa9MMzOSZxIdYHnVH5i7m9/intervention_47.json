Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that they were paying for most things before she moved in, which she occasionally helped with. Then, when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent after a few months and now can't pay even a few hundred. The user paid the full rent, which put them in a tough spot. When confronted, the girlfriend's response was dismissive, saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" and later claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nThe user's main argument is about financial responsibility and fairness. They feel that while they're okay with paying more initially, the ongoing financial burden from the girlfriend's debts without reciprocity is unfair. The girlfriend's behavior seems to stem from an expectation that the partner should cover her financial issues without any contribution.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, splitting rent and bills is a common expectation in shared living arrangements. If one partner is unable to contribute, it's reasonable for the other to reassess the situation. The user's frustration is valid because they're shouldering all the costs, which can lead to financial strain. The girlfriend's test reasoning doesn't hold up because it's not a realistic comparison; a medical emergency isn't the same as ongoing financial mismanagement.\n\nLegally, if the lease requires both tenants to pay, the user could be liable if the girlfriend doesn't contribute. However, the user's choice to end the relationship and ask her to leave is a personal decision, not necessarily a legal one. Emotionally, the user feels betrayed and overburdened, which justifies their reaction.\n\nThe girlfriend's mindset that the guy should pay for everything seems to be a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual support, not one-sided financial dependence. The user's decision to prioritize their own financial stability is understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong for deciding to end the relationship due to financial imbalance and lack of mutual responsibility. The key factors are fairness in shared living costs and the expectation of reciprocity.\n"
