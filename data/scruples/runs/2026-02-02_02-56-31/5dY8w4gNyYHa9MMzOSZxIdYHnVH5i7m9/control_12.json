Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The couple moved in together, and initially split the rent. The girlfriend then couldn't pay her share due to her debts, and the author ended up paying the full rent. This happened twice. The author mentions that he's in a precarious financial situation because of this. When he confronts her, she responds with something like \"why do I have a boyfriend then,\" implying she expects him to cover everything. The author then kicks her out. The girlfriend later says it was a test to see how he'd handle a tough situation, like an accident.\n\nSo, the main points are about financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The author felt the split wasn't fair, and the girlfriend's behavior of not contributing led to his decision. The girlfriend seems to believe that the guy should pay for everything, which the author initially accepted but found unequal over time.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, many relationships do have some financial contributions from both partners, even if the man traditionally pays more. However, when moving in together, splitting rent equally is common. The girlfriend's inability to pay her share due to her own debts might be a valid issue, but if she knew this would happen, maybe she should have communicated better. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he's taking on more debt as a result.\n\nThe girlfriend's test explanation seems dismissive and possibly manipulative, as she's using the relationship to cover her financial issues without reciprocity. The author's decision to end the relationship because of this could be seen as justified if there was a mutual understanding that they would split costs, and she repeatedly failed to meet her part of the agreement.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like discussing financial expectations first before moving in together. But given the situation where the girlfriend's actions were causing financial strain and she wasn't willing to compromise, the author's actions might be seen as protecting his own financial well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his financial responsibilities, especially after setting boundaries and the girlfriend not respecting them. The girlfriend's behavior, expecting the partner to cover everything without reciprocity, is problematic. The final decision to end the relationship because of this imbalance seems reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
