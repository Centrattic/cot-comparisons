Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. The situation seems to involve financial disagreements.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved in and didn't contribute equally. The user mentions they paid for most things, and later when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent. He ended up paying the full rent, which caused him financial strain. She justified it by saying it was a test for how he'd handle a crisis. \n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The user believes the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some balance. The girlfriend's behavior seems to lack that balance. The user's decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave was due to her not contributing to shared expenses, leading to his financial stress. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms too. In some cultures, it's expected that the guy takes on more financial responsibility. However, when it comes to shared living costs like rent, splitting it equally is common, regardless of gender. The user might have felt obligated to pay more, but when the girlfriend couldn't contribute, it became a problem. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning about it being a test for a crisis situation is a bit off. Real-life emergencies are different from personal financial mismanagement. The user has his own debts and couldn't afford to cover everything. \n\nFinancial compatibility is crucial in relationships. If one person can't manage their own finances and expects the other to cover their expenses, it can lead to conflicts. The user's actions were to protect his own financial stability, which is understandable. \n\nBut maybe there was a lack of communication earlier. The user could have set clearer expectations about financial responsibilities when moving in together. However, given that the girlfriend was consistently not contributing, the user's decision to end the relationship seems justified. \n\nSo, based on the information provided, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
