Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a relationship where the guy paid for most things, including rent after moving in together. The girlfriend didn't pay rent for a couple of months, citing her own debts. The user paid the full rent, which strained his finances. When he asked her to pay back or contribute, she refused, leading him to kick her out. Now she claims it was a test to see his reaction to tough situations.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. \n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship are a big deal. When two people move in together, splitting the rent and bills is usually expected unless there's a mutual agreement otherwise. The user mentions that they agreed to split the rent initially, but the girlfriend stopped contributing. He tried to negotiate, but she wasn't willing to pay her share, even when asked to pay back. The user then decided to take control of the situation by making her leave.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the user is in a tough spot. He's taking on more debt by paying the full rent, which affects his ability to manage his own bills and loans. The girlfriend's approach seems to be that the guy should handle everything, which the user had disagreements about but went along with. When it came to moving in together, the expectation might have been that they both contribute equally. The user's frustration is understandable, especially when his own financial stability is at risk.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning after the breakup\u2014that it was a test\u2014doesn't sit well. Using someone's financial situation as a test seems manipulative and unfair. The user acted to protect his own financial health, which is a valid concern. He didn't just kick her out without trying to resolve the issue; he gave her chances to pay and then took action when she didn't follow through.\n\nHowever, kicking someone out of a shared apartment can be legally and emotionally complicated. It's important to consider whether there's a proper legal process for removing a cohabitant, especially if they're not on the lease. If the user isn't the sole leaseholder, he might not have the legal right to remove her without going through the proper channels. But the user mentions that the apartment is his, so if he's the sole leaseholder, he might have more leeway. Still, eviction processes can be tricky and might require legal steps even for roommates.\n\nEmotionally, the user's actions stem from feeling taken advantage of and not being able to manage his own finances. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her dismissive attitude (\"why do I have a boyfriend then?\") likely added to his frustration. The user's decision to end the relationship and remove her from the apartment was probably a last resort after prior attempts to address the issue failed.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect his financial stability and setting boundaries when the relationship isn't balanced. However, the method of kicking her out could have legal implications if not handled properly. It's possible that a more constructive approach, like discussing financial responsibilities upfront or seeking mediation, could have been better. But given the circumstances and the girlfriend's behavior, the user's actions seem justified as a means of self-preservation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the user isn't in the wrong. He made a tough decision to protect his own financial well-being after repeated issues with unequal contributions. The girlfriend's approach was not considerate of his situation, and the test explanation doesn't excuse her behavior. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
