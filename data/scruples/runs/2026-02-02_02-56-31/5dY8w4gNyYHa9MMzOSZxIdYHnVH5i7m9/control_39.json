Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy mentions that he was used to paying for everything, even groceries and events, while she paid once in a while. They moved in together, split rent for a few months, but then she couldn't pay. He paid the full rent, which caused him financial strain. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see his reaction to a tough situation.\n\nNow, considering the responsibilities in a relationship. When people live together, splitting rent and bills is usually expected unless there's a prior agreement. The author paid full rent twice because she couldn't, which put his own finances at risk. He communicated his need for her to contribute, but she didn't. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual responsibility. The author tried to handle it by asking her to pay back, but she didn't. He set a boundary when it became unsustainable. The girlfriend's approach seems to have been expecting financial support without contributing, which can be a problem. \n\nBut some might argue that relationships should involve support through tough times. However, the situation here isn't an accident or temporary issue; it's ongoing and she had debts. The author acted when it became clear she couldn't or wouldn't help, which is a valid decision for his own well-being. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a tough but reasonable choice to prioritize his financial stability after repeated issues. The answer should be B.\n"
