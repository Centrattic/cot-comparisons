Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy and his girlfriend moved in together. Initially, he paid for most things, and she occasionally helped with cleaning and some payments. When they moved in together, they split the rent for a while. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. The guy paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. Now, she can't pay again, and when he confronts her, she says that's why she has a boyfriend. He kicks her out, and she claims it was a test.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is financial responsibility in a relationship. The guy feels it's unfair to bear all the costs, especially when her financial situation isn't improving. The girlfriend seems to expect the guy to cover her expenses, which he's doing, but it's causing strain on him. \n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, relationships do require mutual support, but there's a balance. If one person is consistently shouldering all the financial burden without reciprocation, that can be an issue. The guy tried to split the rent initially, but when she couldn't pay, he covered it. However, expecting a partner to handle all financial responsibilities without any contribution might be unrealistic. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay everything, even after moving in together, might be problematic. She's using her debts as an excuse, but if she's in a relationship where financial support is expected, there should be some compromise. The guy's decision to end the relationship because of this might be harsh, but if he felt it was necessary for his own financial stability, maybe it's understandable.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that it was a test to see how he'd react in an emergency is a bit concerning. Testing someone's limits in a real crisis isn't fair. The guy might have overreacted by kicking her out immediately, but he's also within his rights to set boundaries, especially if he can't sustain the financial load. \n\nFinancial issues are a common cause of relationship problems. The key here is whether both parties made reasonable compromises. The guy did try to split the rent, but when she couldn't pay, he had to cover it. The girlfriend isn't contributing, which leads to his frustration. \n\nI think the guy isn't entirely wrong. He's setting boundaries for his own well-being, which is important. However, the way he handled it by kicking her out might be seen as extreme. But considering the ongoing financial strain and lack of reciprocation, his actions could be justified. The girlfriend's expectation that he should cover everything without any contribution is the bigger issue here. So the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
