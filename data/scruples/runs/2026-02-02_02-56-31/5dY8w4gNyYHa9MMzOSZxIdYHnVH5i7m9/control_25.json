Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a breakup where the author kicked their girlfriend out of their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The key points are about financial responsibilities in a relationship and whether the author was justified in their actions.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were paying for most things, like dinners, events, trips, and groceries, even though they believed the guy should pay for most, they expected some give and take. When they moved in together, the girlfriend initially helped with rent and bills but then stopped, leading to the author paying the full rent, which caused them financial strain. The breaking point was when the girlfriend couldn't pay again and even suggested it was a test of how the author would handle a tough situation.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is financial responsibility in a shared living arrangement. Typically, when two people live together, it's expected that they split the costs equally unless otherwise agreed. The author's frustration stems from the girlfriend not contributing her fair share, leading to financial strain on them. The author then decided to end the relationship and asked her to leave, which seems like a way to address the financial imbalance.\n\nBut wait, maybe the author overreacted? They did pay the full rent for the apartment, which is their legal obligation if they're the leaseholder. However, kicking someone out of their home, even if it's their apartment, can be a heavy action. If the lease is in the author's name, they can legally ask someone to leave, but it might come down to the emotional and ethical considerations. The girlfriend's argument that it was a test for emergencies is a bit of a stretch\u2014real emergencies are different from ongoing financial irresponsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have had the right to set boundaries, especially if the relationship was becoming unequal. The girlfriend's expectation that the author would always cover her expenses without reciprocation could be a sign of an imbalanced relationship. The author's decision to end things could be seen as standing up for their own financial stability, which is important.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. Did they talk about financial expectations before moving in together? It seems like they didn't, leading to misunderstandings. The author might have handled it better by discussing the situation more calmly rather than abruptly asking her to leave. However, given the repeated issues and the financial strain, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, while there might be some fault in not setting clear boundaries earlier, the immediate action of asking her to leave could be justified given the circumstances. The girlfriend's behavior likely contributed to the situation. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
