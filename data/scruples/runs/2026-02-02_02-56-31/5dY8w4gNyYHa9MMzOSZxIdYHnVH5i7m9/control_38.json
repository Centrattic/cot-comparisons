Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. Hmm. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend moved into his apartment and didn't contribute enough, especially with rent. They were splitting rent when they moved in together, but she couldn't pay her share. He ends up paying all the rent, which is causing him financial strain. When she can't pay again, he kicks her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation. \n\nSo, the main points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author believed in the guy paying most, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend wasn't contributing equally, especially when they moved in together. When she couldn't pay rent, he decided to end things. \n\nNow, considering societal norms, in many relationships, especially when two people are living together, splitting costs is expected. But the author mentions that he was paying for most things, including rent, and she wasn't helping enough. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent might be due to her financial situation, but the author is struggling too. \n\nThe key question is whether the author was wrong to kick her out. On one hand, he's standing up for his financial stability. On the other, maybe he could have handled it differently, like setting clearer boundaries earlier. However, the fact that she moved out voluntarily for a week before and didn't contribute when asked might justify his actions. Also, her claiming it was a test is problematic because that's not a fair way to assess someone's commitment. \n\nSo, the author is prioritizing his own financial health, which is reasonable. While relationships require compromise, there's a point where one person's financial burden becomes unsustainable. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and testing his patience might make the author right to end the relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
