Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. They've been in a situation where they've been covering most of the expenses, and now with her not paying rent, they split. The key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and boundaries.\n\nFirst, when two people move in together, especially if they're in a committed relationship, splitting expenses like rent is usually expected. The user mentions they tried splitting for a couple of months, which implies an agreement. But when the girlfriend couldn't pay, the user took over, which strained their finances. The girlfriend's reasoning that the boyfriend should pay because she's there as his girlfriend might be a cultural or personal belief, but in a shared living situation, contributing to shared costs is typical.\n\nThe user's frustration is valid because they're covering all expenses while their own financial stability is at risk. The girlfriend's failure to meet her share of the rent, especially after being asked, and then justifying it as a test is problematic. The user made a decision to end the relationship based on financial disagreements, which can be a personal choice. However, kicking someone out of an apartment might have legal implications if they're on the lease. But the user says it's their apartment, so maybe they have the right to ask her to leave.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. Financial mismatch in a relationship can lead to breakups, and the user acted to protect their own finances. However, communication might have been lacking. The user could have set clearer boundaries earlier. But the girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to cover everything without reciprocity is also an issue. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own financial health, but the method of handling it (kicking her out) might be seen as harsh. However, given the circumstances, it's a decision based on self-preservation. So, likely answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
