Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. \n\nFirst, the user is asking for an analysis of whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over rent issues is at fault. The situation involves the girlfriend not contributing to rent and other expenses, leading to the author paying everything while she handles some chores. The key points here are the financial responsibilities and the expectations in a relationship.\n\nThe author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. When they moved in together, they initially split the rent, but the girlfriend started not paying her share, leading to the author covering the full rent. This caused him financial strain, and after multiple instances of her not contributing, he decided to end the relationship and ask her to leave.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, many people expect both partners to contribute to shared expenses when living together. The girlfriend's refusal to pay rent despite being able to contribute some might be seen as unfair. The author's frustration is valid because financial responsibilities are a significant part of a relationship, and one person shouldering all costs can lead to resentment.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to kick her out of his apartment. While his frustration is understandable, the decision to end the relationship over this might be seen as harsh if there were other options, like setting clearer boundaries or discussing financial expectations earlier. The girlfriend's claim that she was testing his reaction to hard situations adds another layer. If this was a test, maybe the author could have addressed it with communication rather than an immediate breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding his finances. If the relationship became a financial burden due to one-sided contributions, it's reasonable for him to prioritize his own well-being. The key is whether the author acted within the bounds of a healthy relationship by addressing the issue directly before taking extreme steps.\n\nIn summary, while the author's actions might seem abrupt, his decision to end the relationship is based on valid concerns about financial responsibility. The girlfriend's behavior contributed significantly to the conflict. Therefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
