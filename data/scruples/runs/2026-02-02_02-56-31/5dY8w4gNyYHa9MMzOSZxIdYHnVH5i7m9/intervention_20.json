Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out of their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been in a relationship where the user has been paying for most things, including rent after she moved in. She initially helped a bit with groceries and cleaning but not equally. When they moved in together, she couldn't pay rent due to her debts. The user paid the full rent, which put them in a financial bind. Then, when the next month came, she couldn't pay anything again, leading the user to kick her out. She later claimed it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Financial responsibilities in a relationship can be a sensitive topic. The user expected some give and take, which makes sense. However, when they moved in together, splitting the rent is a common arrangement. The girlfriend's inability to pay due to her own debts isn't necessarily her fault, but the user might feel they're shouldering too much. \n\nThe user's actions: Breaking up and asking her to leave because she couldn't pay rent. Legally, if they're in a lease together, the user might still be responsible for the full rent regardless. Kicking her out without legal process could be problematic. Emotionally, the user feels wronged because they're covering all expenses while their own debts grow. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She's in a situation where she can't pay rent due to personal financial issues. She might not have considered the long-term impact on the user's finances. Her \"test\" comment is probably not helpful and could be seen as manipulative, but it's also a sign of her own financial stress.\n\nEthically, the user has the right to expect financial contributions from a partner they live with. However, evicting someone without proper legal steps isn't advisable. The user's decision to end the relationship is personal, but the method of eviction might not be the right approach. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user was the sole renter and the girlfriend wasn't on the lease, they might have more authority. But if they were co-tenants, both are legally responsible. The user might have acted out of frustration, which is understandable, but it's important to consider both parties' circumstances.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If they broke up and asked her to leave without following proper procedures, maybe partially. However, the core issue is about financial responsibility and expectations in the relationship. The user's frustration is valid if they were covering all costs, but the way they handled the eviction could be problematic. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and the \"test\" comment also played a role. \n\nOverall, it's a complex situation where both parties have some responsibility. The user might not be entirely in the wrong, especially if the financial imbalance was unsustainable. However, the method of resolving it could be questioned. So, probably answer B (not in the wrong), but with caveats about handling the situation more constructively.\n"
