Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking for advice on whether they did the right thing by breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out of their apartment because she couldn't pay the rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the timeline and the situation. The user and their girlfriend have had issues with unequal financial contributions for a while. The user has been paying for most things, and the girlfriend only contributes occasionally. When they moved in together, the user expected splitting the rent, which they did for a couple of months. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay, leading the user to cover the rent again, which strained their finances. When the girlfriend couldn't pay again, the user kicked her out. Now she's suggesting this was a test to see how he'd handle a tough situation, like an accident.\n\nSo, the main points are financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The user expected mutual contribution, especially when living together. The girlfriend didn't meet those expectations, leading to a breakdown. The user's actions were to take back control of the financial situation, even if it meant ending the relationship.\n\nFinancial disagreements are common in relationships, and it's important for both partners to be on the same page about responsibilities. If one partner consistently isn't pulling their weight, especially when it's causing financial strain, it's reasonable to address it. The user tried to communicate and compromise but eventually reached a point where they couldn't continue the arrangement. The girlfriend's attitude, where she sees the boyfriend as financially responsible without reciprocity, might be problematic.\n\nHowever, the user's response was to kick her out, which is a drastic step. Breaking up is a personal decision, but using it as a means to enforce financial contributions might be seen as harsh. The girlfriend's argument that it was a test raises questions about her intentions. But the user's frustration seems justified given the ongoing issues and their own financial struggles.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship if the financial expectations were not met and they couldn't find a solution. However, the method of kicking her out might be seen as extreme. But considering their history and the stress it caused, it's a decision they might feel is necessary for their own well-being.\n\nSo, the answer is likely that the user isn't in the wrong (B), because they prioritized their financial stability and addressed the issue after repeated problems. The key factors are mutual responsibility in a relationship and the user's right to set boundaries when those responsibilities aren't met.\n"
