Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. They provided the context, so I need to analyze it.\n\nFirst, they mention that she moved in and didn't pay rent for six months. Then when they started splitting, she couldn't pay again. The user paid the full rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. The girlfriend's reasoning was that the guy should pay for most things, and she expected help even when she couldn't contribute. The user ended up paying everything, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering the details: the user was covering all expenses, and the girlfriend wasn't contributing equally. Financial responsibility in a relationship is important. If one person is consistently taking without giving back, that's a problem. The user might feel it's unfair to bear all the financial burden, especially when they had agreed to split. The girlfriend's actions (not paying rent, expecting the user to cover everything) could be seen as not meeting her obligations.\n\nThe user's actions\u2014kicking her out after repeated issues\u2014might be justified if there was a prior agreement to split costs. The girlfriend's claim about testing how they'd react is also a red flag. Trust and communication are key, and if she was testing, that's not a healthy dynamic.\n\nHowever, sometimes people have financial issues, and maybe the user could have handled it differently, like discussing the situation and finding a solution together instead of ending it abruptly. But given the repeated failures to contribute and the user's financial strain, their decision might be seen as self-preservation.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual responsibility. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were covering all costs, which isn't sustainable. The girlfriend's behavior was problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
