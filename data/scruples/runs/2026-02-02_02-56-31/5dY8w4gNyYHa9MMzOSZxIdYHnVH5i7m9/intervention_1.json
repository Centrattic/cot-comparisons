Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by breaking up and asking his girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. They had an arrangement where he paid for most things, but when they moved in together, she couldn't contribute financially, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Did they agree on splitting the rent when moving in together? The user says they did for a couple of months, but then she couldn't pay. If there was an initial agreement and she couldn't follow through, maybe that's a problem. However, if the agreement wasn't clear from the start, the user might have been setting up an expectation that wasn't realistic. \n\nNext, financial responsibility. The user mentions he pays for most things, expecting some reciprocity. But when it comes to rent, which is a major expense, expecting her to contribute is reasonable. If she's aware of her financial situation and still moves in without being able to pay her share, that's an issue. However, if the user didn't communicate clearly about financial expectations before moving in, that could be on him too.\n\nEmotional aspects: The girlfriend seems to believe the guy should pay everything. This could indicate a mismatch in values regarding financial responsibility in a relationship. The user's frustration is valid if he's taking on more financial burden without reciprocity. But breaking up over this might be extreme if there was an understanding that she would contribute when possible. \n\nThe girlfriend's statement that it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis might be a way to justify her behavior. The user is correct to point out that financial emergencies are different from recurring financial neglect. \n\nOverall, the user might not be in the wrong if they had an agreement and she violated it. However, if there was no clear agreement about financial responsibilities from the start, he might share some responsibility. The key points are communication, mutual agreements, and respect for each other's financial situations. Since the user did set boundaries and the girlfriend couldn't meet them, he's justified in his actions. So the answer is B.\n"
