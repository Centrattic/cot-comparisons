Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for not paying rent is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a relationship where the guy paid for most things, including rent after moving in together. The girl wasn't contributing equally, especially with rent. When she couldn't pay her share, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the guy was wrong to do that. Let me think about the key points here.\n\nFrom the guy's perspective, he's handling the financial burden alone. He mentions that he believes the guy should pay most, but there needs to be some give and take. The girl wasn't contributing equally, especially with rent, which is a significant expense. When she couldn't pay, he had to cover it, which put his own finances at risk. He felt it was unfair and decided to end the relationship by asking her to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might argue that relationships often involve support, and maybe she thought he was supposed to take care of her financially. She later claims it was a test, which suggests she might have been testing his commitment. However, the guy didn't agree with her approach, and her not paying rent repeatedly led to his decision.\n\nFinancial responsibilities in relationships can be tricky. While some people expect the man to take the lead, mutual support and contribution are usually expected. If one person is consistently not pulling their weight, especially in shared living expenses, it's reasonable for the other to feel wronged.\n\nThe guy's actions were a response to ongoing issues. He tried splitting rent initially, but she couldn't pay. He gave her chances, but when she failed again, he took action. His frustration is understandable given the financial strain. The fact that she considered it a test might be a red flag, as it shows a lack of consideration for his situation.\n\nI think the key here is whether the guy had a right to ask her to leave. Since they were living together, rent is a shared responsibility unless otherwise agreed. If she was unable to contribute, maybe they should have discussed other arrangements, like her moving out. But by the time he kicked her out, it was after repeated failures to pay. His actions were a consequence of her not meeting her financial obligations.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the guy isn't in the wrong. He tried to be understanding but ultimately had to prioritize his own financial stability. The girl's approach was irresponsible, and his response, while harsh, was a result of her actions. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
