Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong when they broke up and kicked their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial responsibilities in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author mentions that he paid for most things during the relationship, which she occasionally reciprocated. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent after a while. He paid the full rent for a couple of months, which strained his finances. Now, she can't pay again, and he kicked her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial expectations in a relationship. Traditionally, some people have different views on splitting costs. The author believed in the guy paying most but wanted some give and take. The girlfriend's approach seems to be relying on him financially, which might not align with his expectations.\n\nThe question is whether he was wrong to break up and evict her. Factors to consider: mutual agreement on financial responsibilities, communication, and fairness. Did he and the girlfriend have a prior agreement on splitting rent? It seems they tried splitting initially but she stopped contributing. He warned her before, and when she couldn't pay again, he decided to end the relationship. \n\nIs it his fault for not setting clearer boundaries earlier? Maybe. Could he have handled it differently, like discussing finances more openly from the start? Possibly. But the situation also depends on cultural or personal expectations. If he agreed to split rent when moving in together, then her not contributing after that is a breach of that agreement. \n\nHer response that it was a test is problematic. Testing how he'd handle her financial issues without prior discussion seems unfair. He had a right to expect her to cover her share as agreed. His financial strain is a valid concern, and he made a choice to end the relationship to protect his own stability. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If they didn't have clear discussions about financial responsibilities from the beginning, both could share some blame. But since the author tried splitting for a while, then she stopped, and he gave her chances to pay back, his decision to end it when she couldn't fulfill her part might be justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (he's not in the wrong) because he acted based on mutual agreements and his own financial limits, while she didn't meet her responsibilities. However, there's a nuance where better communication could have prevented this. But the question is about being in the wrong, and if they didn't have a clear agreement, maybe he shares some responsibility. Hmm. But given the details, she didn't hold up her end, and he made a choice to protect himself. So B seems correct.\n"
