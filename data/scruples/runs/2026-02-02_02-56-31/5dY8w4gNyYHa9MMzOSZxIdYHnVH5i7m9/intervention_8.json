Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and asking her to leave because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their living arrangement. She moved in, and initially, she wasn't paying rent, bills, or groceries. The user kept covering most expenses, which he thought was okay as long as there was some give and take. However, when they moved in together and agreed to split the rent, she started missing payments. Eventually, she couldn't pay at all, leading the user to ask her to leave.\n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a big topic. The user might feel that he's shouldering all the financial burdens, which is unfair. The girlfriend's mindset that the guy should pay for everything is a key point here. The user tried to compromise but ended up in a situation where he's stuck paying everything, causing his own financial strain.\n\nThe girlfriend's claim that she was testing how he'd react in tough situations is a bit concerning. It suggests she might have anticipated this scenario and used it as a way to assess his commitment, which isn't a healthy approach. The user's frustration is valid when someone expects you to cover all their expenses without any reciprocity, especially when it affects your own financial stability.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, the user has the right to set clear expectations about shared living costs. If those boundaries weren't communicated or respected, then the user isn't at fault for enforcing them. Ending the relationship to protect his financial health seems reasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his own needs and financial responsibilities. The girlfriend's actions led to the situation, and the user's response was about maintaining fairness and mutual responsibility. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
