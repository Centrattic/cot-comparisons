Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they were in a relationship where he paid for most things, which she expected. She moved in and for six months didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries, except for occasional help with cleaning. Then they moved in together and agreed to split the rent. She couldn't pay the last part of February, he paid, and now she's saying she can't pay again. He got angry, told her to leave, and she claims it was a test. He's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. Financial responsibilities in a relationship can be tricky. The key points here are the initial agreement on splitting costs, her inability to contribute, and his frustration. When they moved in together, splitting rent is a common arrangement. If she agreed to that but can't fulfill her part, that's a problem. However, expecting someone to cover all expenses if they're in a tough situation might be part of a relationship, but it's not a given. \n\nHe mentions he was paying for most things before, but she wasn't contributing equally. Moving in together, splitting rent is a fair expectation. If she can't meet her financial obligations, that's a breach of the agreement. His reaction might be seen as justified because he's left covering everything, which strains his finances. However, maybe he should have addressed the issue earlier or tried to find a solution together instead of ultimatums. \n\nBut given that she already didn't pay before and now is refusing again, his decision to end the relationship might be seen as self-preservation. The fact that she considered it a test is concerning because financial responsibility is a serious matter. Testing how someone would react in a crisis by not paying rent is irresponsible and could be seen as manipulative. \n\nSo, the user's actions were a response to her not fulfilling her part of the agreement, which could be seen as necessary. However, maybe there's a middle ground where communication could have led to a different outcome. But in the end, he's standing up for his own financial well-being, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
