Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about breaking up and kicking the girlfriend out of the apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The user is asking if the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their girlfriend moved in together in 2018, and for six months, the girlfriend didn't pay rent or bills. The author paid most of the expenses, expecting some give and take. Then, when they moved in together, they split the rent for a few months. But the girlfriend started having financial issues and couldn't pay her share. The author paid the full rent, which put them in a tough spot financially. Now, the girlfriend again can't pay, and the author kicked her out. The girlfriend claims it was a test to see how the author would handle a crisis.\n\nSo, the key points are: financial responsibility in a relationship, expectations of shared expenses, and the author's reaction. The author seems to have taken on the majority of the financial burden from the start. When the girlfriend couldn't pay, the author decided to end the relationship and the living arrangement. The girlfriend's argument is that the author should support her in tough times, but the author is struggling financially themselves.\n\nI need to consider relationship norms. In many relationships, splitting expenses is common when cohabiting. If the girlfriend couldn't meet her share, even after discussions, that's a problem. The author tried to work with her but eventually couldn't sustain the financial strain. The girlfriend's response that it was a test seems dismissive of the author's financial stress. The author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as a way to protect their own financial stability. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if the agreement was to split the rent and the girlfriend couldn't fulfill her part despite the author's help, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one person isn't contributing their fair share, especially in a shared living situation, it's reasonable to reassess the relationship. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the author to handle everything despite her own financial issues could be the real problem here. The author's reaction, while harsh, might be a response to a long-standing issue where the girlfriend didn't take responsibility. \n\nHowever, the way the author handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately\u2014might be seen as extreme. Maybe they could have discussed alternatives, like temporarily adjusting the split or seeking other solutions. But given the financial strain and the girlfriend's lack of commitment, the author might feel it's the only way to manage their own situation. The girlfriend's test argument is probably not a valid reason to expect the author to bear all costs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were dealing with someone who didn't contribute financially as agreed, leading to their own financial problems. The decision to end the relationship was a way to address an unsustainable situation. Therefore, the answer is B."
