Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and their girlfriend moved in together in June 2018. They split the rent for a couple of months, but then she started not paying. The author ended up covering all the rent, which caused financial strain. When the author confronts her again, she says it's a test to see how he'd react. The author then kicks her out, leading to the question of whether they did the right thing.\n\nFrom what I know about relationships and financial responsibilities, splitting costs is usually expected when couples live together. The girlfriend's inability to pay might be due to her financial situation, but the author had previously been covering most expenses even before moving in. The key here is whether the author's expectations were communicated clearly. If the author believed in the guy paying most but expected some contribution, especially after moving in, then the girlfriend's not paying rent could be a breach of that understanding. However, the author's reaction of suddenly kicking her out might be seen as harsh if there wasn't prior discussion about financial responsibilities. \n\nThe girlfriend's justification as a test is concerning. Testing someone by not paying rent when it's a shared responsibility can be irresponsible. The author might have felt that their support was being taken for granted. On the other hand, handling such a situation through open communication and setting boundaries might have been a better approach. \n\nFinancial stability in a relationship requires both parties to contribute. If one is consistently not pulling their weight and it's causing strain, it's a valid reason to reconsider the living arrangement. The author's decision to stop the unequal sharing, especially after being put in a precarious situation, could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nBut did they overreact? If the author had discussed the expectations from the start and tried to work together, maybe. However, based on the information given, the author seems to have set boundaries but the girlfriend didn't meet them. The author's financial stress is real, and the girlfriend's test reasoning is ethically questionable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were trying to maintain a fair balance but had to act when that balance was disrupted. The answer is B.\n"
