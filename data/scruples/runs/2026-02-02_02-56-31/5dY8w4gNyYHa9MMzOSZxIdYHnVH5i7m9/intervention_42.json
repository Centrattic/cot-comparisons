Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. They had a situation where she moved in, initially didn't pay much, then after moving in together, she couldn't contribute financially. The user ended up paying all the rent, leading to financial strain.\n\nFirst, financial responsibility in a relationship is a big topic. The user mentions they believed the guy should pay most, but expected some give and take. The girlfriend's behavior of not paying rent and cleaning irregularly seems to be a problem. The user had to cover all expenses, which caused them financial issues. \n\nThe key points here are mutual agreement on splitting costs and the girlfriend's inability to contribute despite the user's financial support. The user's reaction was to ask her to leave, which might be seen as a last resort after repeated issues. The girlfriend's argument that the user should handle her financial problems while hers get worse is questionable, as relationships typically require both parties to contribute where possible.\n\nThe user's frustration is valid, especially if there was an unspoken or explicit agreement to split expenses. The girlfriend's lack of financial contribution, despite the user's efforts, led to a breaking point. The test comment from the girlfriend adds to the user's justified anger, as it seems dismissive of the user's financial struggles. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider if the user had a prior agreement. If there was no clear agreement, the user might be seen as setting boundaries after being taken advantage of. However, if the user agreed to cover her expenses without her contributing, they might have contributed to the problem. But given the user's financial strain and the girlfriend's repeated inability to help, the user's decision to end the relationship seems reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the user addressed a recurring issue where the girlfriend wasn't contributing, leading to financial hardship. The user's actions were a response to a pattern of behavior, not an isolated incident.\n"
