Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. They mentioned she had a mindset where the guy should pay for everything, and even though they helped each other sometimes, it wasn't equal. Now, they're living together, she can't pay rent, and he's paying everything, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, financial responsibilities in a relationship can be tricky. The user believes the guy should pay most, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend, however, seems to rely heavily on the user financially. When they moved in together, splitting rent made sense, but she couldn't pay her share. The user is frustrated because they're covering everything, leading to financial strain.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Did they discuss financial responsibilities upfront? It seems like there was a lack of clear agreement on splitting costs. The girlfriend's claim that she was testing his reaction in a tough situation might not justify her not contributing. However, the user's reaction was to kick her out immediately, which could be seen as harsh, especially if there's a lease agreement where both are supposed to cover their share.\n\nFinancial issues can strain relationships, but the approach to resolving them matters. Instead of an ultimatum, maybe discussing a plan to manage debts together or adjusting the financial arrangement could have been better. However, given that she consistently couldn't pay and it caused significant stress, the user's decision might be understandable. The question is whether the user overreacted or if it was justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a fair split, but maybe they could have handled it more constructively. The girlfriend's behavior was problematic, not contributing her share. The user's actions were a response to that, but the method might be questioned. However, the answer likely leans towards the user not being in the wrong because the situation was about mutual financial responsibilities and the girlfriend's inability to meet her part.\n"
