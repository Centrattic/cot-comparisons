Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and asking her to leave their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. They mention that they were used to paying most expenses, and she contributed sometimes but not equally. They moved in together and split rent initially, but she stopped paying due to her debts. When they asked her to pay, she refused, leading the user to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The relationship's financial dynamics were a problem from the start. The user believed the guy should pay most expenses, but there should be some balance. The girlfriend moved in and didn't contribute rent for six months, then after moving in together, she couldn't pay. The user ended up paying all the rent, which is causing them financial strain.\n\nThe user's action was to ask her to leave because she wasn't contributing. The girlfriend's response was that it was a test. The user is questioning if they overreacted.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual effort and respect. Financial responsibilities are part of that. If both parties agreed to split the rent, then not contributing is a breach of that agreement. The user had to cover all the costs, leading to their own financial issues. They had a right to enforce the agreement, especially if they discussed splitting expenses beforehand. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute, even when asked, is problematic. The user's frustration is understandable, and taking action to protect their own financial stability isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's claim that it was a test is a red flag for manipulation.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the user is not in the wrong). They had a valid reason to ask her to leave given the financial agreements and the lack of contribution from her side. However, it's also important to consider the context of their prior discussions and whether they had a clear understanding about financial responsibilities when moving in together. If there was an agreement and she violated it, the user's actions are justified.\n"
