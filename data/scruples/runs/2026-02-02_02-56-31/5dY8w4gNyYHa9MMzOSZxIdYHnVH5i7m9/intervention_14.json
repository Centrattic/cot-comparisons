Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they were wrong to break up and kick their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The user mentions that they took on most of the financial responsibilities, including rent, groceries, and other expenses, while the girlfriend contributed minimally. When they moved in together, they split the rent initially, but the girlfriend couldn't pay her share later, leading to financial strain on the user.\n\nThe key points here are consent and prior agreements. Did they have an agreement about splitting rent when they moved in together? The user says they split it for a couple of months, which implies some prior understanding. However, when the girlfriend couldn't pay, the user had to cover the full amount, causing him financial stress. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that the boyfriend should pay because she's in debt and that it's the guy's responsibility might not be fair. Financial responsibility should be mutual in a relationship, especially when sharing living expenses. If one partner is consistently unable to contribute, it can create an imbalance. \n\nThe user's frustration seems justified given the financial strain. However, kicking someone out of an apartment can have legal implications. Depending on local laws, tenants have rights, and evicting someone without proper legal process might be problematic. The user should have followed proper eviction procedures if the girlfriend was a tenant.\n\nThe girlfriend's test argument is a red flag. Using a partner's financial situation as a test is manipulative and unfair. The user had the right to set boundaries, especially after repeated issues. \n\nIn summary, while the user's actions might have been impulsive, the underlying issue of unequal financial responsibility is a valid concern. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship over financial mismanagement, but the method of removing her from the apartment should be legally sound. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong), but with a note about legal procedures.\n"
