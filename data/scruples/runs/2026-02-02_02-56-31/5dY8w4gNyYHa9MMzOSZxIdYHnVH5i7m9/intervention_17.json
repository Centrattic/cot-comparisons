Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial contributions and expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user had a girlfriend who moved in with them. For six months, she didn't pay rent or bills, only cleaning occasionally. Then they moved in together and split rent initially, but she stopped contributing. The user paid the full rent twice, which strained their finances. The girlfriend's reasoning was that the guy should pay everything, and she saw her living with them as a benefit rather than a shared responsibility. The user decided to end the relationship when she couldn't pay again, leading to her leaving.\n\nThe user is wondering if they were wrong. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nNow, considering cultural norms: in many relationships, there's an expectation of shared financial responsibility, even if it's not equal. The user took on most financial burdens, which might be common in some contexts, but the girlfriend's lack of contribution seems excessive. She wasn't helping with rent, groceries, or bills beyond occasional cleaning. The user's frustration is understandable because their financial situation was getting worse while she wasn't contributing.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that the guy should pay everything, and that the relationship justifies her not contributing, is problematic. The user might have felt they were being taken advantage of. When the girlfriend couldn't pay rent again and then said \"why do I have a boyfriend,\" that's a red flag. The user's decision to end things when their financial stability was at risk could be seen as justified, especially if they felt the relationship was unequal.\n\nHowever, communication is key. Did the user address the financial expectations before moving in together? If they didn't set clear boundaries, maybe they share some responsibility. But the girlfriend's behavior of not contributing and then justifying it as a test might show a lack of consideration. The user acting to protect their own financial well-being seems reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The user had valid reasons to end the relationship due to financial strain and unequal contributions. The girlfriend's actions and mindset probably contributed to the breakdown. The user's response was to protect their own situation, which is understandable.\n"
