Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay the rent. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that he was paying for most things from the start, like dinners, events, trips, groceries, etc. The girlfriend would sometimes pay for things and cleaned occasionally, but the author felt it wasn't equal. He believes the guy should pay for most, but there needs to be some give and take. So he didn't have a problem with paying more, but there should be some contribution from her.\n\nThen in June 2018, she moved in. For six months, she didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries virtually. She did clean sometimes, but again, not equally. Then they moved in together, splitting the rent initially. But then in February, she couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, putting himself in a financial tight spot. When the next month came, she said she could pay a few hundred but didn't follow through. Eventually, she said she couldn't pay at all, leading the author to kick her out.\n\nHe's frustrated because he's helping her with her financial issues but she's not reciprocating. She even implied that being in a relationship means he should help her financially, which he found unacceptable. She later said it was a test to see his reaction in a tough situation, but he thinks her situation is different from an accident scenario.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for breaking up and kicking her out? Let's consider the key points here. Financial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. If both partners are supposed to contribute to shared expenses, especially when living together, not contributing could be a valid reason for conflict. The author had been covering her financial needs before moving in, and then during their shared living arrangement, she couldn't pay her share. The author might feel that there's an unfair financial burden on him, leading to the decision to end the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend had legitimate financial issues. If she was in debt, perhaps she couldn't help it. But the author might argue that she should have been upfront about her financial situation before moving in together. Also, her response when confronted\u2014saying it's part of the boyfriend's role to help\u2014might have crossed a line, making the author feel taken advantage of.\n\nAnother angle is communication. If they hadn't set clear expectations about financial responsibilities before moving in, that could be a point of contention. The author might have assumed she would contribute more, while she expected him to take care of her financially, like she had in the past. The test she mentioned also seems manipulative, which could justify the author's reaction.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if both are supposed to split rent and bills when living together, then not contributing without prior agreement could be seen as unfair. The author's decision to end the relationship might be a response to protecting his own financial stability, which is understandable. However, the approach of kicking her out might be seen as harsh, but considering the circumstances, he might feel it's necessary.\n\nI think the key here is whether there was an agreement on financial responsibilities. If they didn't discuss and agree on how to split costs, then both might share some responsibility. But given the information, the author tried to split the rent initially, and the girlfriend's inability to contribute led to conflict. The author might not be in the wrong because he's standing up for his financial well-being, but there's also a need to consider her circumstances. However, since she was in her own debts and couldn't contribute, maybe her expectations were unreasonable. The test she mentioned also doesn't help her case. So overall, the author's actions might be justified, making him not in the wrong.\n"
