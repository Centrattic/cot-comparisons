Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is the guy who broke up with her and kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple moved in together, and the guy ended up paying all the rent because the girlfriend couldn't afford her share. The main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. \n\nThe guy mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend was living rent-free for six months and then couldn't pay her share even after moving in together. The author paid the full rent, which put his own finances at risk. When confronted, the girlfriend said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident. The guy found that excuse unacceptable and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Financial responsibilities in relationships can be tricky. While it's common for one partner to cover more expenses, there's an expectation of mutual support. However, if one partner is consistently unable or unwilling to contribute, it can create imbalance. \n\nThe author's actions were to pay the rent and then kick her out when she couldn't contribute. He did give her chances to pay, even asking her to repay some amount. Her response, especially the \"test\" comment, seems dismissive and irresponsible. The author's frustration is understandable, especially when his own financial stability is at stake. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have addressed the issue earlier, set clearer boundaries, or sought a financial agreement before moving in together. But given the circumstances where the girlfriend was not willing to take responsibility, the author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's protecting his financial well-being and setting clear boundaries, which is reasonable when the other party isn't contributing their fair share. The girlfriend's behavior seems to lack responsibility, and the author's reaction is about addressing that imbalance.\n"
