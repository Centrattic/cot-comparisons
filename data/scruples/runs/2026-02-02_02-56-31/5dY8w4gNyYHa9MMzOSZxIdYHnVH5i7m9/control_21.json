Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me read through the scenario again to get all the details.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend moved in and for six months didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. She did clean occasionally but it wasn't equal. Then when they moved in together, they split the rent for a while. In February, she couldn't pay due to her debts and moved out for a week. The author paid the full rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. Now, she's saying she can't pay again. The author is furious, tells her to leave, and she later claims it was a test. The author is wondering if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, financial responsibility in relationships is a big topic. The author mentions they believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be give and take. The GF didn't contribute much even when she was supposed to split the rent. Then when she couldn't pay, the author had to cover it, which added to their own financial stress. The GF's attitude seems to be that the partner should always cover her expenses, which the author found unfair. \n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility and communication. The author tried to split the rent but the GF couldn't or wouldn't contribute. The author felt it was unfair to bear all the financial burden, especially when their own debts were piling up. The GF's claim that it was a test (like an accident scenario) seems dismissive of the author's real financial struggles. \n\nIn relationships, especially when sharing living expenses, both parties should contribute as per their means. If one person is consistently unable or unwilling to contribute, it can strain the relationship. The author's decision to end the relationship because of this might be seen as justified, given the lack of reciprocity and the financial stress caused by the GF's actions. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of how the author handled it. Kicking someone out abruptly could be seen as harsh, but given the context of ongoing issues and the GF's lack of accountability, the author might feel it was necessary. The GF's expectation that the author should always cover her expenses without any give and take is problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to accommodate the GF, but when it became unsustainable, they took action. The GF's behavior showed a lack of responsibility and consideration for the author's financial situation. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
