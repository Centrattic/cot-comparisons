Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, he mentions that he's been covering most of the expenses in the relationship, including dinners, events, trips, and groceries, with her contributing occasionally. When they moved in together, he agreed to split the rent, but she stopped paying after a few months due to her debts. He ended up paying the full rent, which put his own finances at risk. Now she's refusing to help with rent again, leading to him asking her to leave.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and expectations. He believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. When they moved in together, splitting rent was part of the agreement, and she broke that agreement by not contributing. He's now having to bear all the costs, which is causing him financial strain. The argument could be that he's justified in ending the relationship because of unmet financial expectations and her refusal to fulfill her part of the shared responsibilities. On the other hand, some might argue that handling a partner's financial issues is part of a committed relationship, but the user might feel that there's a limit, especially if the balance is consistently unequal.\n\nHe also mentions she considered it a test of his response to her financial problems. That could be seen as manipulative, which might support his decision. However, the user might also reflect on whether communication was effective before taking such a drastic step. But given the information, it seems he made a choice to prioritize his own financial stability after repeated issues. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries after her consistent failure to contribute, especially in a shared living situation where financial splitting is expected.\n"
