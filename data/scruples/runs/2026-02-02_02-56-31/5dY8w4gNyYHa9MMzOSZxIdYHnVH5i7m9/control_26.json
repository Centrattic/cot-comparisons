Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The user wants to know if the author's actions were justified.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that from the start, he was paying for most things, and she occasionally helped with groceries or cleaning. He believed in the guy paying for most, but there should be some give and take. When they moved in together, they split the rent initially. But then she couldn't pay, so he covered it. She later couldn't pay again, and he kicked her out. She said she was testing his reaction.\n\nHmm. Financial responsibility in relationships can be tricky. The author had financial strain because he's covering all the rent, which might be a valid concern. If someone can't contribute to shared expenses, it can create tension. But did he handle it correctly?\n\nHe paid the rent when she couldn't, which is kind, but when she refused to help again, he ended the relationship. Is that too harsh? Well, it's his apartment, so he has the right to who lives there. If she's not contributing, he might feel it's unfair. However, breaking up over unpaid rent could be seen as a personal decision. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude\u2014saying she doesn't need to pay because she has a boyfriend\u2014sounds problematic. The author might be justified in feeling taken advantage of. Also, she moving out temporarily but then not returning to help could be a red flag. Her \"test\" excuse after the breakup is questionable, as it's not a real emergency but a recurring financial issue.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed the financial expectations earlier. But he did mention trying to split the rent, and she couldn't contribute. It's a matter of mutual respect and fairness. If both can't meet their obligations, the relationship might not be sustainable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and leaving the situation where he felt financially strained and taken advantage of. His actions stem from wanting to protect his own financial health, which is reasonable.\n"
