Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details of the situation. The author mentions that from the beginning, the girlfriend expected the guy to pay for everything, which he did, except for occasional times when she contributed. They moved in together, and initially split the rent, but then she stopped paying her share because of her debts, leading to the author paying all the rent. This financial strain caused him to break up and kick her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and expectations in a shared living situation. The author feels that the girlfriend isn't contributing fairly, which is leading to his own financial stress. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to believe that the guy should bear all the costs, even when she's unable to pay. \n\nNow, considering the question of whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if they were both on the lease, he can't just kick her out without proper legal procedures. However, the story says \"kicking her out of my apartment,\" which might imply that he had legal standing, perhaps because she was a roommate and he's the sole tenant. If that's the case, he might have the right to ask her to leave if they were not in a formal lease agreement. But if they were both on the lease, he would need to follow eviction processes, which the author might not have done, which could be problematic. However, the story doesn't specify the legal details, so maybe that's not the main issue here.\n\nMorally and ethically, the author is frustrated because he's taking on all the financial burden, which is causing his own debts to grow. He's trying to maintain a balance where he pays for most things but expects some reciprocity, which he doesn't get. The girlfriend's argument that it was a \"test\" of his commitment in a crisis might come across as manipulative. \n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship and remove her from the apartment. While the immediate action might be harsh, the underlying issue is about financial responsibility and mutual respect in a relationship. The author isn't wrong in holding her accountable for her part in the financial responsibilities of their shared living situation. Relationships require compromise and both parties contributing in ways that are fair. If one person is consistently taking without giving back, it's reasonable for the other to reassess the relationship. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of support in times of financial difficulty. The girlfriend's debts might be a legitimate issue, and the author might have been willing to help her through it if she had communicated better or made an effort to contribute in other ways. But she didn't, and instead, she seemed to expect him to bear all the costs without any reciprocity. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might be seen as harsh, his reasons are based on the girlfriend's lack of contribution and financial irresponsibility. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
