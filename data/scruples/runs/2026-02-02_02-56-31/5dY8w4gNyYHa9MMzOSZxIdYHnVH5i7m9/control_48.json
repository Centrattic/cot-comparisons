Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that from the start, he paid for most things, and she occasionally contributed. He didn't like the imbalance but went along with it. Then when they moved in together, she expected him to cover rent despite her financial issues. He paid the rent when she couldn't, which put him in a tough spot financially. Now she's refusing to pay anything again, leading him to kick her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The author believed in the guy paying for most things but expected some reciprocity. When they cohabitated, splitting rent was the norm, but she couldn't contribute. The author felt it was unfair to bear all the costs, especially when his own finances were strained. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that the boyfriend should handle her financial issues seems problematic. Financial responsibility in a relationship should involve both parties contributing to shared expenses. If one partner consistently can't meet their share, it's a valid concern. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after multiple instances of her not paying her part.\n\nHowever, kicking someone out suddenly might be a harsh reaction. Maybe communication could have been better. But the fact that she admitted it was a test adds insult to injury. The author's decision to end the relationship because of unsustainable financial strain is a personal choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on societal views. In many places, you can't just kick someone out of an apartment without legal steps. If they were in a lease together, he might need to go through proper eviction processes, which he might not have done. That could make him legally wrong, but the question is about moral wrong, not legal.\n\nMoral standpoint: The author had the right to set boundaries regarding shared financial responsibilities. If the girlfriend was aware of this and still didn't contribute, then the author's actions are justified. But if he didn't agree to her not paying rent in writing or through mutual agreement, then maybe he overstepped. However, since the situation was causing him financial harm, his decision to protect his own finances isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to cover everything without contribution is the main issue. The author tried to accommodate her but reached a breaking point. So, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
