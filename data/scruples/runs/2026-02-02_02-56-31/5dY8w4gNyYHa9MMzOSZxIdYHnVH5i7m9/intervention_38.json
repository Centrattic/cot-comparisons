Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. They mention that from the start, she expected him to pay for most things, and even though she paid occasionally and helped clean, he felt it wasn't equal. Then when they moved in together, she couldn't pay rent, so he paid it all, but now she's not contributing again and he's furious, leading him to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of their financial arrangement. The user believed the guy should pay most, but there should be some give and take. However, when they moved in together, splitting rent is typical. The girlfriend not contributing to rent might be a problem. But the user had let her live rent-free for six months before, which might have set expectations. Then when she couldn't pay in February, he paid the full rent. Now she's not paying again, and he's angry because he's having to cover everything.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that she doesn't need to pay because she has a boyfriend might be a red flag. Financial responsibility in a relationship is important. If both parties are supposed to contribute, especially when living together, not paying your share can be a valid reason for conflict. The user might feel exploited, especially if his financial situation is being strained.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. Did they have discussions about financial expectations before moving in together? If not, that could be a point where the user is at fault. But if they did agree to split costs and she repeatedly fails to meet her part, then the user's reaction might be justified. Also, her testing his reaction by not paying could be seen as manipulative, which adds another layer.\n\nThe user's actions\u2014kicking her out after she refuses to pay\u2014might be seen as a necessary step to protect his financial stability. But was there an opportunity to address the issue before taking that action? Maybe setting clearer boundaries or discussing a repayment plan if she's in debt.\n\nIn summary, if the user and girlfriend had mutual expectations of splitting costs and she consistently fails to contribute, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if there was a lack of prior agreement or if the user didn't address the issue earlier, that could be a point of fault. But based on the information given, it seems like the user made a stand when his own financial well-being was at risk, which might be justified.\n"
