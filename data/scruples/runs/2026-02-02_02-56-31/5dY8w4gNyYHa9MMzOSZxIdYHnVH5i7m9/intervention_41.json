Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, financial responsibility in a relationship is a big deal. The user mentions that they paid for most things, and she occasionally contributed but it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, splitting the rent was an agreement, but she started not paying her share. The user was covering rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. \n\nThe key issue here is responsibility and fairness. When two people live together, it's generally expected that they split the costs. If one partner can't contribute, it creates an imbalance. The user tried to be understanding, but after multiple instances of her not paying, they had to take action. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude seems to be that the guy should handle everything, which isn't healthy in a relationship. The user had to prioritize their own financial stability, especially with their own debts. Her response to the situation, thinking it was a \"test,\" shows a lack of consideration for the user's financial stress. \n\nSo, the user's actions were about protecting their own financial health and setting boundaries. They didn't force the breakup but acted when there was a clear pattern of neglecting responsibilities. The user isn't in the wrong here. \n"
