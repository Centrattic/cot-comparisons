Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup where the guy kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, the user says he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. They moved in together, split rent for a while, but then she couldn't pay. He ended up paying all the rent, which put him in a tight financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nHmm, so the key points are about financial responsibility in a relationship. Did he overreact? Well, when partners move in together, splitting expenses is common. If she couldn't pay her share, maybe he should have set clearer boundaries earlier. But he did try to split the rent initially. When she couldn't pay, he covered it, but she didn't repay him. Then when she said she couldn't pay again, he decided she needed to leave. \n\nIs that fair? On one hand, he's taking responsibility for his own finances and setting a boundary when it's no longer sustainable. On the other hand, maybe he should have communicated better or found a solution together, like adjusting the split or helping her find a way to pay. But she seems to have tested his patience multiple times. \n\nHer saying it was a test to see how he'd react in an accident or something is a red flag. That suggests she anticipated needing more help without reciprocating, which is unfair. The author's reaction was probably a way to protect his own financial stability after repeated issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He set boundaries after repeated failures to meet her end of the deal. She didn't contribute when she could, and he had to take action to prevent further financial strain. Answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
