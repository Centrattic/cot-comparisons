Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me start by understanding the key points of the situation.\n\nFirst, they moved in together, and initially, they split the rent. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share, and the user covered it, leading to financial strain. Now the user is paying full rent alone, and the girlfriend expects him to continue because of their relationship. The user is justifying it by saying he expects some financial reciprocity, but she's not contributing, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe user feels they're not in the wrong because they believe in the guy paying for most things but there should be give and take. However, the girlfriend's expectation that the guy should handle everything, including rent, is a problem. The user's main issue is that she's not pulling her weight financially, even when they agreed to split the costs.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, when two people live together, especially in a committed relationship, sharing expenses like rent, bills, groceries is typical. The user was contributing more than his fair share for a long time, even when they weren't officially together. When they moved in together, the expectation should be mutual contribution. The girlfriend's inability or refusal to meet her obligations is a significant issue here.\n\nThe user's reaction of asking her to leave might seem abrupt, but considering the financial strain and the repeated failures to contribute, it's a reasonable step to protect their own financial stability. The girlfriend's comment about it being a test is concerning because it shows a lack of consideration for the user's financial situation and a possible lack of genuine effort to contribute.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. If the girlfriend had valid financial issues, the user might have been more understanding. But she's had ongoing issues, not a one-time problem. The key is ongoing responsibility. If both parties can't meet their obligations, the relationship might have underlying issues. The user's decision to end the living arrangement to save their own finances seems justified.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user isn't in the wrong for standing up for their financial well-being. The girlfriend's expectations were unreasonable given the mutual agreement to share costs. The user had to make a tough call to prioritize their own responsibilities, which is a valid action.\n"
