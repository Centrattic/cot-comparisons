Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. So, first, I need to understand the key points here.\n\nThe author mentions that he paid for most things when they were dating, and she paid occasionally. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent after some time, leading to conflict. He paid the full rent and then eventually kicked her out because she couldn't contribute. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author might argue that it's unfair to expect the man to pay everything, especially when they moved in together. Financial responsibilities should be shared, and if one partner can't contribute, it's a problem. The author made a choice to break up when she couldn't help, which he might see as necessary for his own financial stability.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author didn't address the issue earlier. He mentions that he went along with her expecting him to pay most things. When they moved in together, maybe he should have set clearer boundaries from the start. By allowing her to not pay rent for six months and then splitting it, he might have created an imbalance. The fact that he didn't enforce equal responsibility earlier could be a point against him. Also, her moving in without paying rent might be a red flag he ignored.\n\nAnother angle is the communication. Did the author talk about financial expectations before moving in together? If he didn't have that conversation, he might share some responsibility for the situation. The girlfriend's test comment is a bit concerning\u2014using a relationship to test how someone would handle financial stress isn't healthy. The author's reaction of breaking up might be justified if he felt it was a deal-breaker.\n\nBut some might say that breaking up because she couldn't pay rent is harsh, especially if she has debts. However, the author mentions that his own financial situation was strained, and he couldn't handle paying everything. So it's a matter of priorities and what each person is willing to accept in a relationship.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author took responsibility for not setting financial boundaries early on. If he knew from the start that she expected him to pay everything and continued without addressing it, maybe he's partly at fault. But if he tried to split the rent and she was unable to pay despite her efforts, then his decision to break up might be seen as reasonable. The fact that she moved in without paying rent for six months is a significant issue. The author might not be in the wrong for enforcing equality after that point.\n"
