Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The author mentions that he paid for most things initially, and she contributed occasionally. When they moved in together, she stopped paying her share of the rent, citing her own financial issues. The author ended up paying full rent, which put his own financial situation at risk. When he confronted her, she seemed uncooperative, and he decided to end the relationship and ask her to leave.\n\nI should think about the expectations in a relationship regarding financial responsibilities. While there's no one-size-fits-all approach, mutual contribution is usually expected. The author did pay for a lot, but there was an imbalance. When they moved in together, splitting rent is standard unless otherwise agreed. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute, despite the author's financial strain, is a key point. \n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship. Some might argue that communication could have helped, but given the repeated issues and the girlfriend's apparent lack of accountability, the author might feel justified. The girlfriend's response that it was a test complicates things, but the author's decision to prioritize his own financial stability is understandable. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author likely isn't in the wrong. He set boundaries after she repeatedly failed to meet her responsibilities. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
