  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking up and kicking my girlfriend out of my apartment because she couldn\u2019t pay rent?\nShe\u2019s in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything, and against my better judgment I went with it. Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup over financial responsibilities. The person (let's call him John) broke up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. He mentions that she expected him to pay for most things, and when they moved in together, she stopped contributing to rent, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship regarding financial contributions. John believed that the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. However, when they moved in together, splitting the rent is typical unless otherwise agreed. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent might be due to her financial situation, which could be out of her control. John is upset because he's covering her share, which he's not comfortable with.\n\nJohn's main issue is that he feels he's shouldering all the financial responsibility, which is unsustainable for him. He decided to end the relationship and asked her to leave. The girlfriend then claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, which John finds unreasonable because her situation isn't an accident but a lack of funds.\n\nNow, considering both sides: John is within his rights to set boundaries about financial responsibilities. If he agreed to split the rent initially but the girlfriend couldn't contribute, he's justified in adjusting the arrangement. However, the way he handled the breakup by kicking her out might be abrupt. But given that they were in a committed relationship and living together, his decision to end things over financial disagreements is his choice, especially if he felt it was unfair.\n\nThe girlfriend's expectation that the guy should pay everything, even when living together, might not be fair. John is asserting his need for balance. While her financial struggles are real, John isn't obligated to support her financially if she's unwilling to contribute. The test explanation from the girlfriend seems like an excuse to justify her lack of contribution, which could be a red flag.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. John isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his financial stability and setting boundaries. The girlfriend is responsible for her own financial obligations. Therefore, John's actions in breaking up and asking her to leave are justified. The answer is B.\n"
