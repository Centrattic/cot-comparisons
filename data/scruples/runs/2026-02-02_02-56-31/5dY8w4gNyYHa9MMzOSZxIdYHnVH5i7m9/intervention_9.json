Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether they made a mistake by breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, the context is that the girlfriend moved into the user's apartment and didn't contribute much financially. She did some cleaning, but the user felt it wasn't equal. They ended up moving in together and splitting rent initially, but then she couldn't pay her share. The user ended up paying the full rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. The girlfriend's reasoning was that since they're in a relationship, the guy should handle the bills, and she even called it a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they were wrong to kick her out. Let's break it down. Financial responsibility in a relationship is a big deal. If both parties are in a shared living situation, splitting rent and bills is usually expected unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The user mentions that they believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. However, when the girlfriend couldn't pay, the user was left covering everything, leading to financial strain.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it's a test for potential emergencies seems flimsy. Real emergencies are different because they're unexpected and unavoidable, whereas not being able to pay rent due to personal debts is more about financial management. The user's frustration is understandable because they were covering all the costs, which is unfair if the other person isn't contributing.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require compromise. The user might have known from the start that the girlfriend had different expectations about finances, which could have been a red flag. However, the user tried to make it work by splitting the rent initially, but the girlfriend's inability to meet her obligations led to the breakdown.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The user isn't legally obligated to support their partner financially unless there's a specific agreement. The decision to break up and ask her to leave was based on their own financial well-being, which is valid. The girlfriend's behavior, expecting the user to cover all costs without reciprocity, might be the real issue here.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability and ending the relationship when it became unsustainable. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her justification as a test don't excuse her actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
