Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they were wrong to break up with their girlfriend and kick her out because she couldn't pay rent. They provided the context that she moved in rent-free for six months, then when they moved in together, she stopped paying her share. He ended up paying all the rent, which strained his finances. She even said it was a test to see how he'd react in tough times.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. From his perspective, he might feel that he's been the one supporting her financially, and it's unfair. He mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most, but there should be give and take. She wasn't contributing equally, especially when it came to rent. When he asked her to pay, she didn't, leading to him making a tough decision.\n\nOn the other hand, she might feel that he's supposed to support her, as per the traditional \"guy pays for everything\" mindset he mentioned. She might have thought it was okay to rely on him financially, especially if she was in debt herself. Her response about it being a test suggests she didn't take his situation into account and expected him to cover her financial issues no matter what.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and expectations. He might not be in the wrong if they had agreed to split expenses and she didn't follow through. However, if he didn't set clear boundaries from the start, that could be an issue. For example, allowing her to live rent-free for six months might have set an expectation that she wouldn't need to pay later. Also, when he agreed to split the rent initially, she might have expected that to continue without considering her financial limits.\n\nBut he did mention that he tried to communicate and compromise, but she didn't hold up her end. His decision to ask her to leave might stem from a place of self-preservation and needing to take control of his finances. It's important to note that in relationships, especially cohabitation, financial agreements are crucial. If those weren't clearly communicated, both parties could be at fault. However, in this case, he did take steps to address the issue multiple times before the breakup, so he might be justified in his actions.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. Considering the details, he seems to have made a decision to protect his own financial stability after repeated failures from her to meet her responsibilities. While there could be room for better communication earlier on, his actions don't seem entirely his fault. The final answer would depend on whether the user's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since he tried to work it out and she didn't contribute, he might not be in the wrong.\n"
