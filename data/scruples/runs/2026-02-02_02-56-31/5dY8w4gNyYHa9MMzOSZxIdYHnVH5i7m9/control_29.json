Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a guy who had a girlfriend who moved in with him. Initially, he paid for most things, and she occasionally contributed. When they moved in together, they split the rent for a while. Then the girlfriend started not paying her share, citing her own financial issues. The author ended up paying all the rent, which strained his finances. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd handle stress. The author is questioning if he was wrong to do that.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Financial responsibility in relationships can be a sensitive topic. Traditionally, some people expect the man to pay for more, but that's changing. The key points here are: the author and his girlfriend moved in together, agreed to split rent, but she stopped contributing. He ended up paying full rent, leading to his financial stress. When she couldn't pay again, he decided to end the relationship and kick her out.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, splitting rent when living together is common, so if she couldn't contribute, that's a problem. However, the author's reaction was to kick her out, which is a severe action. The girlfriend's approach of not paying rent and treating it as a test might be problematic, but is the author's response justified? \n\nLegally, if they were in a lease together, both are responsible for the rent. If one can't pay, the other might have to cover it, but there's no legal obligation for one to cover the other's share unless agreed upon. However, in a relationship, expectations vary. The author felt it was unfair to bear all the financial burden repeatedly. His response was to end the relationship and make her leave, which could be seen as harsh, but considering the circumstances of her not contributing and the financial strain, some might see it as a necessary step to protect his own finances.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude, where she expects the partner to handle her financial issues while hers grow, is concerning. The author's frustration is valid. However, kicking someone out of a shared home can have emotional and practical consequences. The author might have considered other options, like discussing a financial plan or setting boundaries before taking such a drastic step. But given her history of not paying, maybe he felt it was the only solution.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if he felt the relationship was unequal and his financial well-being was at risk. However, the abruptness of the action and the lack of a middle ground could be seen as hasty. But given the information, the author's actions were a response to ongoing issues, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
