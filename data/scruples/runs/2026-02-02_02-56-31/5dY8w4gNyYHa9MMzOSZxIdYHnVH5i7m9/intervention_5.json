Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial expectations and responsibilities in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the woman moved in and didn't pay rent for six months, only contributing occasionally. Then, when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent again, leading the user to cover the costs. The user feels it's unfair and decides to end the relationship, which the woman seems to view as a test.\n\nThe user's main point is about financial responsibility and equality. They mention paying for most things, which the woman didn't reciprocate. When the rent issue arises, the user covers it, but it strains their finances. The woman's lack of contribution and her justification (\"why do I have a boyfriend then?\") probably pushed the user to their limit.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In some contexts, it's expected for the man to pay more, but the user says there should be some give and take. The woman's behavior of not paying her share, especially after repeated promises, shows a pattern. The user's decision to end the relationship because of financial irresponsibility is a personal choice, but is it \"wrong\"?\n\nLegally, if they're in a lease together, both are responsible for the rent. If one doesn't pay, the other might have to cover it, which could be a liability. However, in a relationship, splitting responsibilities is often a mutual agreement. The user's frustration is understandable, especially if the woman was aware of the expectations but didn't meet them.\n\nThe woman's claim that it was a test is problematic. Using a partner's financial stability as a test without communication is inconsiderate. The user acted based on their own needs and boundaries, which is a valid approach. While relationships require compromise, there's a limit to how much one should bear the burden unilaterally.\n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries and choosing to end the relationship when their financial well-being was at stake. However, the method of \"kicking her out\" might be abrupt, but given the circumstances, the user might feel justified. The key factors are mutual responsibility and communication, which the woman didn't uphold. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
