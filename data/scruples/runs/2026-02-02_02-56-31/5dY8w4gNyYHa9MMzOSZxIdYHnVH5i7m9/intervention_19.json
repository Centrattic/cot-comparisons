Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. They mention that she expected the guy to pay everything, and she moved in without contributing. The key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and mutual contributions.\n\nFirst, the user and their girlfriend were splitting rent when they moved in together. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share, leading the user to cover it, which put him in a tough financial spot. He's now asking her to pay rent but she refuses, saying why have a boyfriend if not to support her financially. The user is upset because he feels he's carrying the financial burden alone, and he's had enough.\n\nSo, the user's actions: they broke up and asked her to leave because she couldn't pay rent. They're questioning if they were wrong. The key here is whether it's reasonable to expect financial support in a relationship when the other person is unable to contribute. Culturally, there's a norm where men might pay for dates or some expenses, but living in a shared apartment typically requires both to split costs equally. If the girlfriend can't contribute and is relying on the partner to cover everything, that's an imbalance. The user might feel that their generosity was taken for granted, leading to resentment.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she's in a situation where she's struggling with her own debts and bills, and maybe expects the partner to take care of her. But the user's financial stability is also at risk here. The user had to cover the rent, which affected his ability to manage his own debts. Breaking up and asking her to leave could be seen as a way to protect their own financial situation, which is understandable. However, maybe the user should have addressed the issue earlier with open communication before things escalated to the point of splitting up. \n\nBut given the context that the girlfriend was living rent-free for six months and only started contributing after moving in together, and then stopped again, the user's frustration is valid. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to handle all financial responsibilities without reciprocation is problematic. So, the user making a decision to end the relationship due to these financial disagreements is not necessarily wrong. It's about mutual respect and shared responsibility in a living arrangement. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
