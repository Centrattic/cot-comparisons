We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. First, I need to break down the situation. They've known Casey for eight months, been flirting for two. Rumors she had feelings for him for five to six months. They had their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The user made a direct move asking her to go back to his place, which she declined, saying she wasn't \"that\" person and wanted things to develop on the second date. He then lost interest, zoned out during the date, and hasn't responded since, only giving minimal replies when she texts. He's justifying it by saying he lost interest and doesn't want to spend more money without a guarantee of getting \"any\" on the next date.\n\nSo the key points here: he ghosted her after she said no. The question is whether that makes him the asshole. Let's think about consent and respect. She said no, and he's punishing her for not meeting his expectations of physical intimacy on the first date. That seems problematic. Ghosting is a form of cutting someone off without explanation, which can be hurtful. Even if he's honest with himself about his interests, respecting her boundaries and communication is important. \n\nHe mentions she's asked if he's feeling okay and wants to go out again, but he's responding with minimal replies. That's dismissive. If he's not interested in continuing, he should communicate that respectfully. Ghosting can be seen as cowardly or inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and undervalued. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent and the risk of another date where she might not give in adds a transactional aspect that's not healthy. Relationships should be about mutual respect, not just a cost-benefit analysis. His approach of wanting sex on the first date might not align with her values, and she's clear she wants to take things slower. His reaction is to abandon the relationship entirely, which is a harsh response. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his feelings and not trying to fake interest. However, the method of cutting off communication without explanation can still be hurtful. The question is about whether his actions are in the wrong. The subreddit usually considers intent and impact. His intent was to not engage, but the impact is that he's left her hanging, which is disrespectful.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's ghosting someone for not meeting his physical expectations, which is a valid boundary of hers, and he's not handling the rejection with respect. He should have communicated his feelings more clearly rather than cutting her off abruptly.\n"
