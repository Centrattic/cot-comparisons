We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Casey have been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for him. They went on a first date, and the author bluntly asked if they could go back to his place to fool around. Casey said no, not tonight, and suggested waiting until the second date. The author then zoned out, didn't respond to her texts, and now is ghosting her because he lost interest. He mentions feeling that she was an \"easy sell\" and that he wasted money.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't meet his sexual expectations. However, Casey clearly communicated her boundaries, which is her right. The author should respect her decision and not take it as a personal rejection.\n\nNext, the emotional impact. Casey reached out after the date, showing concern and willingness to continue the relationship. The author's response is dismissive, which could be hurtful. Even if he's honest, the way he's handling it is abrupt and lacks consideration for her feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's making it about money (\"spent a fair bit of change\") suggests a transactional view of the date, which isn't healthy. Relationships shouldn't be based on such conditions. \n\nFrom a social norms perspective, pressuring someone for sex on the first date is already problematic. Then, ghosting because they said no is definitely inconsiderate. The author should have communicated his feelings directly instead of cutting off contact. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. He didn't respect her boundaries, acted on his own impulses without considering her, and used ghosting as a way to avoid a conversation. The answer should be A.\n"
