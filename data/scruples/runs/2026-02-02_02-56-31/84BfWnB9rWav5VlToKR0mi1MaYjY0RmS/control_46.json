We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author went on a date with Casey, asked her to go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest, stopped responding, and now isn't replying. The main issue here is whether it's acceptable to ghost someone for this reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author approached Casey with a direct question about fooling around, which she declined. He then decided to end communication because she didn't meet his expectations. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author isn't interested anymore, cutting off contact without explanation can be hurtful.\n\nCasey's perspective is important. She said she likes him and wants to take things slower. The author dismissed her feelings and interests after one date. It's possible that he wasn't considering her boundaries or her need for a more gradual relationship. By prioritizing his own desires and then ghosting when she didn't comply, he's not respecting her autonomy.\n\nFinancial reasons are mentioned as part of his frustration. He spent money on the date and feels it was wasted. However, using money as a justification for ghosting isn't valid. People should communicate about their expectations before spending money, and it's selfish to let financial loss influence respectful treatment of someone else.\n\nThe author's honesty is a point he makes, but honesty doesn't excuse poor behavior. Being honest about not wanting to continue the conversation is one thing, but ghosting is another. He should have communicated his disinterest clearly and respectfully, even if he doesn't want to maintain a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The author's actions show a lack of both. He didn't handle his disappointment maturely and instead chose to ignore her, which is inconsiderate. Casey deserves an explanation, even if he's not interested anymore.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful. Ghosting is not an appropriate response to unmet expectations, especially when the other person has shown interest in continuing the relationship. The author should have communicated his feelings instead of cutting her off.\n"
