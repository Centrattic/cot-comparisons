We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is that they asked her to go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspect here. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person hanging without explanation. But there's also the aspect of personal boundaries and expectations. The user was clear about his intentions, and she said no. He felt that since she didn't meet his expectations, he didn't want to continue. However, everyone has different comfort levels and timelines for intimacy. She wanted to take it slower, which is her right.\n\nHe mentions spending money on the date, which he now feels was a waste. But using that as a reason to ghost seems selfish. The key here is that he didn't communicate his feelings properly. Instead of being honest about his disappointment, he just disappeared. That's where the accountability lies. He could have told her he wasn't interested in continuing, but ghosting is a passive-aggressive way to handle it.\n\nSo, even though his actions were based on his own expectations, the way he handled the situation is where he's in the wrong. He should have communicated his feelings rather than ghosting her. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
