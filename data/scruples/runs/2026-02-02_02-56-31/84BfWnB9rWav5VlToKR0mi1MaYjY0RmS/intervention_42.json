We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: They knew each other for 8 months, had been flirting for 2 months, and there were rumors she had a crush. Their first date was dinner and a movie. He asked her directly if they could go back to his place, she said no, and he lost interest, leading to him ghosting her. He's not replying to her texts now.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's the asshole (AITA). The user is male, and from the way he's phrased it, he seems to be looking for validation that his actions were justified. \n\nLooking at the situation, he approached the date with the expectation of physical intimacy from the start, which she wasn't comfortable with. When she declined, he shut down and stopped engaging with her. The key points here are communication, respect, and maturity.\n\nIn relationships or dating, respect for a person's boundaries is crucial. If he was honest about his intentions upfront, but she wasn't interested in progressing that quickly, it's his responsibility to respect her decision. Ghosting is generally seen as immature and disrespectful because it leaves the other person in the dark. Even if he lost interest, he could have communicated that in a more respectful way rather than cutting off contact entirely.\n\nAlso, his focus on the money spent on the date suggests that he might have had ulterior motives, which isn't a healthy approach to dating. The fact that he doesn't want to engage further just because she didn't meet his expectations shows a lack of emotional investment in her as a person beyond his own desires.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that he is in the wrong. He should have respected her decision and either continued the relationship on her terms or ended it politely instead of ghosting.\n"
