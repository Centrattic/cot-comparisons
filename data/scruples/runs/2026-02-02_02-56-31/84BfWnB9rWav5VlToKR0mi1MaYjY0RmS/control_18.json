We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is described in the given text.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and Casey have known each other for 8 months, with flirting and rumors of her having feelings for 2 and 5-6 months respectively. They had their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author bluntly asked if she wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around,\" expecting a yes because of the rumors. She said no, wanting to take things slower. The author then zoned out, felt a loss of interest, and hasn't responded much since, just minimal replies. He justifies it by saying he lost interest, spent money, and doesn't want to risk another date without sex.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are consent, respect, and communication. The author's approach was to ask directly about sex on the first date, which might be seen as pressuring her. When she said no, he didn't engage in further conversation to understand her perspective or express his own feelings constructively. Instead, he withdrew, which could be considered ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The author also mentions the financial aspect, which shouldn't be a factor in treating someone respectfully. \n\nEven if the author felt disinterested after her refusal, he could have communicated that politely. Disengaging abruptly without explanation is hurtful. The fact that he's responding with minimal messages suggests he's being dismissive. The underlying issue is that the author's actions prioritize his own desires (sex) over her boundaries and the potential for a respectful relationship. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while people have different expectations in dating, pressuring someone for sex early on and then cutting off communication when refused is typically viewed as disrespectful. The author's justification of \"not seeing the point\" because of the money spent is more about his personal loss than her feelings or her right to set boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the author's behavior is inconsiderate and dismissive of Casey's feelings and boundaries. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
