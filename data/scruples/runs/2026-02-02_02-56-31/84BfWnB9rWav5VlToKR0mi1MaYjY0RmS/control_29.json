We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors she had a crush for five to six months. They went on their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author directly asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. The author then zoned out during the rest of the date, felt like he \"struck out,\" thought about the money spent, and later ghosted her. He's been responding minimally to her texts, just with thumbs up or \"k.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole here. The key points to consider are communication, respect, and expectations. The author was upfront about his intentions, which is honest, but maybe he didn't consider her boundaries. She made it clear she wasn't ready, and he lost interest because his goal (sex) wasn't met. Ghosting without explaining isn't respectful. He should have communicated his feelings instead of cutting her off abruptly. Even if he didn't want to pursue a relationship, being honest about that would be better than ghosting. Also, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent suggests he might have had transactional expectations, which isn't healthy. So, the author's actions were disrespectful and dismissive of her feelings and boundaries, making him the asshole.\n"
