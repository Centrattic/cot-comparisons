We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, the scenario: They've known each other for 8 months, flirted for 2, and there were rumors she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. First date was watching a movie, dinner, etc. He was direct and asked if she wanted to go back to his place, but she said no, not tonight. He felt awkward and zoned out, then later ghosted her. He's stopped responding except for minimal texts, and he's not interested anymore because he lost his interest after she didn't \"put out.\" He mentions the money spent on the date and not wanting to invest more without a guarantee.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. Even if he's honest, cutting off communication abruptly without explanation can be hurtful. Casey gave a clear reason for her decision, and he's choosing to end the interaction because she didn't meet his expectations. \n\nRespect for others' boundaries is key. He approached her with a direct question, which is okay, but she set a boundary. His reaction of losing interest and ghosting shows a lack of respect for her decision. Also, the fact that he's using the money as a factor suggests he's valuing the experience over her feelings, which isn't fair.\n\nIn relationships, communication is important. If he was disappointed, he could have expressed that respectfully, even if he felt she didn't meet his expectations. Instead, he chose to ignore her follow-up messages, which is dismissive and unkind. \n\nSociety often values honesty, but it's also about how that honesty is delivered. Being honest about not wanting to continue is one thing, but doing so by ghosting is another. He could have been upfront about his feelings post-date to manage her expectations without leaving her hanging.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is prioritizing his own needs and expectations over Casey's comfort and communication. Ghosting is a form of emotional neglect, which is inconsiderate. Even if the situation is about mismatched expectations, the way he handled it (ghosting) is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
