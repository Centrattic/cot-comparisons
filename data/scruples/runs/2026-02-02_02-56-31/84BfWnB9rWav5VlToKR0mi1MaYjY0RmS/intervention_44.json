We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're the asshole for ghosting someone because she didn't sleep with him on the first date. First, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly.\n\nHe's known Casey for eight months, flirting for two, and rumors of her having feelings for five to six months. They went on their first date, which included a movie, dinner, etc. He asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and said she wanted things to develop further. He lost interest and hasn't responded except with minimal texts since.\n\nNow, the key points here. Honesty is important in relationships, but how it's delivered matters. He was upfront about wanting physical intimacy, which is his prerogative. However, she set boundaries and declined. His reaction was to ghost her, not respond, and cut off communication. \n\nIn relationships, especially in dating, mutual respect is crucial. If someone declines a sexual advance, respecting their decision is important. Ghosting because someone doesn't meet your expectations can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. It leaves the other person confused and possibly hurt. The user mentions not wanting to spend more money if there's no guarantee, but that's a personal issue and not a reason to ghost someone.\n\nAlso, the fact that he lost interest entirely and stopped responding could be seen as not valuing her feelings. Communication is key. If he couldn't handle the situation maturely, that's a problem. So, from a social perspective, people might see his actions as inconsiderate. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
