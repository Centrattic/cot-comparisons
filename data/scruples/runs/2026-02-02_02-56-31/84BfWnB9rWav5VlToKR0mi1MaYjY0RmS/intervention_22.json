We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't agree to sexual activity on the first date. So, first, what's the main issue here? The person went on a date, asked if they could \"fool around\" and the other person said no. Then the user lost interest and stopped communicating.\n\nHmm, I need to consider social norms and what's considered respectful. Ghosting generally refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The user's reasoning is that they lost interest because their primary goal wasn't met. But is that a valid reason? Relationships and dates can be about more than just physical intimacy. Maybe the user had unrealistic expectations from the start.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned spending money on the date and feeling like it was a \"waste.\" That suggests they might have been focused on getting something out of the date rather than enjoying the experience or building a connection. When someone prioritizes physical intimacy so much that they end the relationship if it doesn't happen immediately, it can be seen as shallow or disrespectful. \n\nThe other person set a boundary and expressed interest in continuing the relationship, but the user didn't respond positively. Instead of having an open conversation about their expectations, the user just disappeared. That could be hurtful and isn't a mature way to handle rejection. \n\nAdditionally, the user's actions might be considered inconsiderate. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt. Even if they lost interest, a simple explanation might have been more respectful. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the user's actions seem to be inconsiderate and based on an unrealistic expectation. Therefore, they might be in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no cultural context or other factors. The question is straightforward, and the user is asking if they're the asshole. In most ethical discussions, respecting someone's boundaries and treating them with respect is key, even if the person isn't getting what they want.\n"
