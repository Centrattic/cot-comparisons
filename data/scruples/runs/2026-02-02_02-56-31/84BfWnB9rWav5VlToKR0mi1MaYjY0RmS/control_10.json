We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone because she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) context, so the community usually judges based on social norms.\n\nThe author went on a date with Casey, asked her to go back to his place for sex, and she said no. He then lost interest and hasn't responded much since, leading to ghosting. He mentions he didn't respond to her texts beyond a thumbs up or \"k\".\n\nFirst, did the author do something wrong? Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person hanging without explanation. Even if there's a reason, cutting off communication abruptly is rude. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't want to have sex, and he felt the date was a waste of money. However, wanting a sexual relationship is his own preference. It's his right to have boundaries, but how he handled it matters. Ghosting isn't the best approach. A better response would be to be honest but respectful, even if they part ways.\n\nAlso, the author approached the date with the expectation of sex, which might not have been mutual. He admitted he thought it was an \"easy sell,\" which could imply he didn't respect her autonomy. Respecting her decision to wait is important. Even if he's disappointed, dismissing her and ghosting shows a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nIn AITA, the key points are respect and communication. The author didn't communicate his feelings and instead ghosted, which is inconsiderate. Even if he's not in the wrong for losing interest, the way he handled it is. So, the answer is likely A (he's the asshole) because of the ghosting and lack of respect in ending the interaction.\n"
