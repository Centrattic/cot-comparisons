We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met Casey, they were flirting for two months, and there were rumors she had feelings for him. They had their first date, which included dinner and a movie. The author directly asked her if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no, suggesting they wait until the second date. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now just replies minimally. He justifies this by saying he spent money and lost interest because she didn't comply with his expectations.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics: pressuring someone for sex on a first date is often seen as inappropriate. The author's approach was blunt, and when she refused, he disengaged. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. The fact that the author was expecting sex based on rumors and prior flirting might not be a valid reason to ghost her. Respect for her boundaries is crucial here. Even if he felt disappointed, cutting off communication without explanation is hurtful and inconsiderate. The author's actions prioritize his own desires over her autonomy and feelings. So, he's in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision and acted selfishly by ghosting her.\n"
