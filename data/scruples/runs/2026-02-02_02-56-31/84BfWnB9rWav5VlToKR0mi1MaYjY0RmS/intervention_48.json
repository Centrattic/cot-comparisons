We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. He was honest about wanting to fool around, she said no, and then he lost interest. He's been ignoring her texts since. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. He went on a first date, asked directly if she wanted to go back to his place, she said no, and he ghosted her. He mentions that she had a crush on him for months and he thought it was a given. But she wanted to take it slow.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. Even if he lost interest, not responding to her follow-up messages could be seen as inconsiderate. He admits he's not trying to hurt her but is prioritizing his own feelings. However, that doesn't excuse the ghosting.\n\nHe also brings up the financial aspect, feeling like he wasted money. While it's understandable to feel that way, it's not a valid reason to ghost someone. Relationships shouldn't be transactional that way. People can't be reduced to their willingness to have sex, especially on the first date.\n\nHe was upfront about his intentions, but she clearly communicated her boundaries. Respecting those boundaries is important. If he wasn't okay with that, maybe the relationship wasn't a good fit, but cutting her off without communication is the issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, he is in the wrong because he ghosted her without explanation, which is generally considered disrespectful regardless of his reasons. The answer should be A.\n"
