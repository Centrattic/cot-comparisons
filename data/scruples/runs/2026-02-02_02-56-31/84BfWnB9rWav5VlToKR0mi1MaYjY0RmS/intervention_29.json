  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for ghosting her after she wouldn't put out?\nSo, I've known this girl Casey for about 8 months now. We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex with him on the first date. So, first, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nThe guy, let's call him Alex, went on a first date with Casey. They did typical date activities, and Alex decided to be direct and ask if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" Casey said no, but indicated she likes him and wants to take things slower. Alex then lost interest, stopped engaging during the date, and hasn't responded to her texts since, effectively ghosting her. He justifies it by saying he spent money on the date and doesn't want to invest more time if there's a risk of not getting what he wants.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, consent and mutual interest are key in any relationship. Alex approached the date with a specific goal in mind, which is to have sex on the first date. When that didn't happen, he decided to cut off communication. That seems problematic because it shows he was primarily interested in physical intimacy and not in building a relationship. Respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. If someone is not comfortable with certain actions, even if you're disappointed, you shouldn't punish them by ghosting. Ghosting can be hurtful and is considered a form of emotional neglect.\n\nCasey set a boundary, and while Alex might have been hoping for a different outcome, her decision is valid. It's important to respect her wishes and continue the relationship on her terms if he's genuinely interested. The fact that Alex is only interested if there's a guarantee of sex suggests he wasn't considering her feelings or the potential for a meaningful connection. Ghosting as a reaction to unmet personal desires is indeed inconsiderate and disrespectful.\n\nHowever, some might argue that Alex is within his rights to disengage if he's not interested in pursuing a relationship that doesn't meet his needs. But the key issue here is the method. Ghosting without explanation is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and can cause emotional distress. A more mature approach would be to communicate his feelings honestly, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nAdditionally, the financial aspect he mentioned (\"fair bit of change\") is not a valid reason to ghost someone. Relationships should be about mutual respect and emotional connection, not transactional value. Feeling that he's wasted money is a red flag in terms of his priorities.\n\nIn summary, while Alex is allowed to have his own preferences, his reaction of ghosting is considered inconsiderate and disrespectful. He should take responsibility for not managing his expectations and for not respecting Casey's boundaries without retaliating. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
