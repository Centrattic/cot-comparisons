We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. So, the key points here are the context of their relationship, the actions taken, and the reasoning behind ghosting.\n\nFirst, they've known Casey for 8 months, with flirting for 2 months and rumors of her having feelings for 5-6 months. They had their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The user proposed going back to his place to \"fool around,\" which Casey declined, saying she wanted to take things slower. The user then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies when she texts. The user's reasoning is that they lost all interest after striking out, and they don't want to spend more money on dates without getting what they want.\n\nNow, thinking about it from Casey's perspective: she said she likes him and wants to take things slow, which is a common and reasonable stance. The user's reaction seems to be based on personal disappointment and financial loss, which might not be valid reasons to cut off communication. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the user felt disinterested after the rejection, there's a social expectation to communicate more clearly rather than just disappearing.\n\nAlso, the user's approach of being blunt about wanting to have sex on the first date might have been too direct, especially if Casey wasn't expecting that. Her response was to set a boundary, which the user didn't respect by moving on. The fact that she's tried to reach out after and the user ignores it shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect dates to build a connection before becoming intimate. The user's focus on getting money back from the date is also a bit shallow and might indicate a transactional view of the relationship, which isn't healthy. So, the user's actions here are seen as dismissive and inconsiderate, making them the asshole.\n"
