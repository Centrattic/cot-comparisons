We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. So, the situation is that they went on a first date, he asked to go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethical aspects here. Ghosting usually refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is doing that, so that's a red flag. But the reason given is that he was only interested in a sexual relationship and when she didn't comply, he lost interest. \n\nNow, the question is whether this makes him the asshole. In many cases, people value respect and honesty in relationships. The author admits he was honest about his intentions upfront, which is good. However, he expected a certain outcome (her agreeing to fool around) and when she didn't meet that expectation, he stopped communicating. \n\nBut wait, just because someone doesn't meet your expectations doesn't mean you have the right to ghost them. Communication is key. Even if he wasn't interested anymore, a respectful approach would be to explain why he's not interested in continuing the conversation. Ghosting can be hurtful and is generally considered rude, regardless of the reason. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he was thinking about the money spent on the date. It's not appropriate to let financial considerations influence your treatment of someone else. People should be valued for themselves, not as a cost-benefit analysis. \n\nOn the other hand, he was upfront about his intentions. Some might say that if you're clear from the start, you can't blame the other person for not meeting your expectations. However, even if you're honest, how you handle the situation matters. Ghosting is still a poor choice because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. \n\nAnother angle: the author's approach to relationships seems transactional. He might be looking for a casual sexual encounter, and when that's not available, he moves on. That's his choice, but it's not necessarily the \"asshole\" part if he's honest. However, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014definitely contributes to being an asshole because it's disrespectful. \n\nAlso, considering that Casey might have wanted to build a relationship, and his immediate loss of interest after one rejection could indicate that his interest wasn't genuine. People have different boundaries, and respecting them is important. By ghosting, he's not respecting her decision, even if he didn't like the outcome. \n\nSo putting it all together: The author's actions are disrespectful regardless of his initial honesty. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he is in the wrong).\n"
