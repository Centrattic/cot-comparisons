We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they went on a first date, which included a movie and dinner. The user made it clear they wanted to have sex that night, but the other person said \"no, not tonight,\" emphasizing she wanted things to develop over time. The user then zoned out, didn't respond well, and later ghosted her. They mention losing interest because she didn't give them what they wanted sexually, and they're focused on the money spent on the date.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. In many cultures, people have different boundaries regarding physical intimacy. The user set an expectation by being direct, but the other person set a boundary by declining. The user's reaction of ghosting because the other person didn't meet their needs seems harsh. Communication is key in relationships. If the user wanted a sexual relationship, they should have clarified that upfront. However, the other person also chose to set her own pace, which is valid.\n\nFinancial considerations shouldn't dictate the value of a relationship. The user's focus on the money spent might indicate a transactional view, which can be problematic. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the user lost interest, a respectful approach would be to explain their feelings.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries. The user's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her consent and her pace. However, the user also has the right to pursue relationships that meet their needs. The conflict here is about differing expectations. Neither side is entirely wrong, but the user's actions (ghosting without explanation) are typically viewed negatively.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user might be at fault for not aligning their expectations with the other person's. They assumed she would be okay with sex, but she clearly stated otherwise. The user's decision to cut off communication entirely is seen as inconsiderate. So, while both parties have valid points, the user's actions are more in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation respectfully.\n"
