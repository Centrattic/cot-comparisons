We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone named Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: They've known each other for 8 months, flirting for 2, and there were rumors she had feelings for 5-6 months. Their first date was dinner, movie, etc. He asked her directly if they could fool around, she said no, not tonight, suggesting maybe on a second date. He then zoned out for the rest of the date, didn't respond well, and after that, he stopped communicating, only giving minimal responses to her texts. He says he lost interest because he expected physical intimacy and was upset about the money spent.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's the asshole. From a moral standpoint, being upfront about expectations is important. He asked directly for physical intimacy, and she declined. That's her right. He then ghosted her because she didn't meet his expectations, which might be seen as dismissive and not respecting her boundaries. Ghosting is generally considered rude, even if you're upset. He could have communicated his feelings instead of cutting her off. Also, valuing the date more for potential physical activity than the actual effort she put into building a relationship shows a lack of respect. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if he was clear about his intentions and she didn't meet them, it's his prerogative to disengage. But the issue is the lack of communication and the abrupt ending. Ghosting without explanation can hurt the other person. The key points are consent, respect, and communication. He didn't respect her decision and then didn't communicate his disinterest properly. So, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong). But need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n"
