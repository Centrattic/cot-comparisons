We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex with him on the first date. He asked her directly if they could go back to his place to fool around, she said no, and he lost interest, so he's been ignoring her texts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The user was honest about his intentions upfront, which is good, but expecting sexual activity on the first date might not be realistic for everyone. The girl made it clear she wanted to take things slower, which is her right. \n\nHe mentions she had a crush on him for months, so maybe he felt entitled? But that's not a valid reason. Disrespecting someone's boundaries by ghosting because they didn't meet his expectations is a problem. Also, the financial aspect he brings up\u2014\"I spent a fair bit of change\"\u2014makes it seem like he's valuing the money over her feelings. That's not healthy.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his loss of interest. But communication is key in any interaction. Instead of ghosting, he could have expressed that he wasn't interested anymore and why, even if it was uncomfortable. Ghosting avoids that conversation and can hurt the other person more.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the user acted inconsiderately by not communicating properly and dismissing her feelings. The girl had a right to set her boundaries, and he should respect that. Therefore, he is in the wrong for ghosting her.\n"
