We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author went on a first date with Casey. They were flirting for two months, and there were rumors she had feelings for him. On the date, he asked her directly if they should go back to his place to fool around. She said no, not tonight, and said they should take it slow. He then zoned out, thinking about the money spent, and after the date, he didn't respond to her texts, kind of ghosting her. He says he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted on the first date and doesn't want to spend more money with the risk of not getting anything else.\n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Let's break this down. First, the author approached her bluntly about wanting to have sex on the first date. That's pretty direct. But she turned him down, saying she wanted to take things slower. Now, he's ghosting her because he lost interest after she said no. \n\nWhat's the issue here? Well, consent and mutual interest are key in relationships. If he was only interested in a sexual relationship and she's not ready, then maybe he shouldn't have pursued a romantic relationship. But he says they were flirting for two months and she had a crush on him. However, when it comes to the actual ask, he made his intentions clear. \n\nNow, the problem is that he ghosted her. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because you cut off communication without explanation. Even if he lost interest, he could have been honest with her. Also, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent is a bit materialistic. \n\nIs it his fault for asking? Maybe not. People have different boundaries. But when she said no, he should respect that. The problem is that he didn't respect her boundaries and then disappeared instead of communicating. \n\nAlso, his reasoning is based on not getting what he wanted. That seems self-centered. A healthy relationship requires mutual respect and understanding. If he's only interested in a relationship that leads to sex quickly, and she's not into that, then maybe it's not a match. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014is the asshole move. \n\nSo, even if his feelings are hurt, cutting off communication without explanation and being dismissive is wrong. The answer is probably A, he's the asshole.\n"
