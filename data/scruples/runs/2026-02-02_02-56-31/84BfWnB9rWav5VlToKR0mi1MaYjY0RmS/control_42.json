We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting after the girl didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nSo the scenario is: They've known each other for 8 months, been flirting for 2 months. The girl had a crush for 5-6 months. On their first date, the guy asks if they can go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She says no, not tonight, wants to take it slow. He then zones out, ends the date with a limp hug, and stops responding. He admits he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted, and he's ghosting her.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the guy's expectations and his reaction. He went into the first date expecting a sexual encounter, which he considered a \"done deal\" given her supposed feelings. When she declined, he lost interest and cut her off. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, relationships should be built on mutual respect and consent. The guy's behavior seems to prioritize his own desires without respecting her boundaries. Ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. By not communicating and cutting her off, he's not taking responsibility for his actions or considering her feelings. Plus, he mentions the money he spent as part of his motivation, which adds a transactional element that's problematic. \n\nHe also says he's not trying to hurt her, but that's not the point. The way he's handling it is dismissive. Even if he's honest about his intentions, the follow-up action of ghosting without explanation is wrong. People should be able to express their boundaries without fear of being ghosted. So, the answer is probably A (he's in the wrong).\n"
