We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The main points are: they asked her bluntly, she said no, he lost interest, and now he's ignoring her.\n\nFirst, consent is key. She didn't agree to have sex, so he can't force her. But the issue here is that he's choosing to ghost her because she didn't comply. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it's cutting off communication without explanation. Even if he's not interested anymore, it's better to be honest and respectful instead of disappearing. \n\nHe mentions she's been flirting for months and he thought he had a \"done deal.\" That attitude shows he might have been using her for a hookup rather than respecting her boundaries. She wanted to take it slow, which is her right. His response of losing interest and ghosting is dismissive of her feelings and the effort she put into the date. \n\nHe also talks about the money spent, which is a red flag. Using financial aspects to justify his behavior is not acceptable. It's important to treat people without ulterior motives like that. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is A because he's being inconsiderate and rude by ghosting. He should have communicated his feelings properly instead of cutting her off. It's not okay to punish someone for not meeting your expectations.\n"
