We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey because she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Casey have known each other for 8 months, with flirting for 2 months. There were rumors she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. They went on a first date, which included dinner and a movie. The author asked her directly if they could go back to his place to fool around. She said no, not tonight, and said she wanted things to develop on the second date. The author then lost interest, didn't respond to her texts, and is now ghosting her because she didn't comply with his expectations of having sex on the first date. He mentions he spent money on the date and feels it was a waste, hence the ghosting.\n\nThe key points here are his expectations and how he handled the situation. He approached her with an expectation of physical intimacy on the first date, which she clearly declined. Her response was to delay it to the second date, which he didn't accept. Now, he's cutting her off because she didn't meet his immediate needs.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries. Casey didn't want to have sex on the first date, which is her prerogative. The author, however, seems to have made his interest conditional on her agreeing to his terms. When she didn't comply, he withdrew interest. This could be seen as treating her as a means to his end (sex) rather than valuing her for who she is. Ghosting her after she showed interest in continuing the relationship could also be considered disrespectful and hurtful, especially since she reached out afterward.\n\nThe author's reasoning centers around his own disappointment and financial loss, which are his issues to deal with, not hers. His lack of empathy and consideration for her boundaries might place him in the wrong. While it's his choice to not pursue a relationship where his expectations aren't met, the way he's handling it\u2014ghosting and cutting her off without communication\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, and if one person's expectations are not met, the right approach is to communicate that respectfully rather than disappearing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own desires over respecting her boundaries and treating her with the respect she deserves. Ghosting is generally frowned upon in social contexts, especially when there's no clear communication about the reasons for pulling away.\n"
