We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex with him on the first date. So first, I need to consider the context and the reasons behind his actions.\n\nHe mentions they've known each other for 8 months and flirting for 2. There were rumors she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. On the first date, he directly asked if they could go back to his place and fool around. She said no, not that night, and said she wanted things to develop. He then lost interest and started ghosting after that. He's thinking about the money spent and the risk of another date without getting what he wanted.\n\nThe core issue here is whether it's acceptable to ghost someone because they didn't meet your expectations regarding physical intimacy. The user's reasoning is that he's not interested anymore and doesn't want to spend more money if there's no guarantee of a physical relationship. But from a social perspective, ghosting someone after a single date, especially when they've shown interest over a long period, might be seen as abrupt and inconsiderate. \n\nEven though he was honest about his intentions, she had her own boundaries. By ghosting, he's cutting off communication without explaining, which can be hurtful. The fact that she reached out afterward shows she's interested in maintaining a connection. His decision is based on his personal preferences, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people value communication and mutual respect. Ghosting without a clear reason can leave the other person confused and feeling rejected, which isn't kind. The user might not have done anything illegal or unethical, but the way he handled it could be seen as rude. So, while he's not wrong in terms of his own desires, the action of ghosting is questionable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A, but I need to check if there's any nuance. The user is being honest and upfront, but the follow-up after the date is where the problem is. He could have expressed his feelings more constructively. Since he's choosing to ghost instead of having a conversation, that's where the issue lies. So yes, he is the asshole for ghosting her.\n"
