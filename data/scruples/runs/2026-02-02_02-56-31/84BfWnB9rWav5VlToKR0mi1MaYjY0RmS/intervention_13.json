We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what ghosting means. It's cutting off all communication suddenly without explanation. The guy went on a date, asked her if she wanted to go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest. He hasn't responded properly to her texts, just minimal responses. \n\nHe mentions he thought she had a crush on him for months, so he expected her to be interested in sex. But she wanted to take things slower. He felt it was a waste of money and time, so he's cutting her off. \n\nNow, evaluating from a moral standpoint. Is it wrong to ghost someone for not meeting your expectations? Well, everyone has different boundaries and expectations. She wanted to take it slow, he wanted to be physical earlier. That's a mismatch. But how you handle it matters. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate because you're leaving the other person hanging without closure. \n\nHe says he's not trying to hurt her, but his actions are still dismissive. Even if he lost interest, he could have communicated that respectfully. The fact that he's giving minimal responses but not cutting her off completely complicates it. But the main issue is his sudden disinterest and not addressing her attempts to communicate. \n\nAlso, spending money and feeling it was a waste is a bit self-centered. The right thing would be to have a conversation to explain why he's not interested moving forward, rather than ghosting. So, even if his feelings are valid, the way he's handling it is the problem. \n\nTherefore, he's in the wrong for ghosting instead of communicating. Answer A.\n"
