We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. He was honest about wanting to fool around, she said no, and then he lost interest and hasn't communicated since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He approached her directly about his intentions, which is honest, but maybe not the best approach. She had a crush for months, but he assumed she'd agree. She gave a clear no and suggested moving at a slower pace. He didn't respond well, zoned out, and after the date, cut off communication. His reasoning is about losing interest and not wanting to spend money again without getting what he wanted.\n\nNow, from a relationship ethics standpoint, consent and mutual respect are key. She said no, so he shouldn't have pressured her. But his reaction was to ghost her, which is dismissive and doesn't respect her boundaries or feelings. Even if he lost interest, cutting off communication abruptly without explanation can be hurtful. It's important to consider that everyone has different boundaries, and not getting what he wanted doesn't justify ending the interaction rudely.\n\nAlso, the part about spending money is a bit transactional. Viewing the date as a \"waste\" because she didn't sleep with him is problematic. Relationships shouldn't be about exchanging money for intimacy. His lack of follow-up communication shows a lack of respect for her as a person beyond his initial desire.\n\nSo, putting it all together: He wasn't in the wrong for not getting what he wanted, but he was in the wrong for ghosting and not respecting her decision. The correct answer would be A.\n"
