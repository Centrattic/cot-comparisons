We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The scenario is that they asked her directly after a date, and she said no, preferring to wait until the second date. He then lost interest, didn't respond much, and now is just giving minimal replies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Ghosting someone usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explaining why. The user admitted that they lost interest because she said no, which suggests that their interest was primarily in a sexual relationship rather than a romantic one. That might be a red flag because if you're only interested in someone for sex, it's not a respectful approach.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent on the date and seeing it as a loss might indicate that he's more focused on his own investment rather than her autonomy and boundaries. Respecting someone's decision to not engage in sexual activity is crucial. Pressuring someone or devaluing their choice is definitely wrong. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if they are in the wrong. While the act of ghosting isn't inherently right, the main issue here is the underlying attitude. If his intention was to be honest and direct, but then treating her decision as a rejection that makes her uninteresting, that's problematic. It might show that he wasn't genuinely interested in a relationship but only in a sexual encounter, which is not respectful.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, from a moral standpoint, respecting her decision is right. However, the way he handled the situation\u2014ghosting and not communicating\u2014might be considered inconsiderate, even if his interest waned. People can have different expectations, but dismissing someone solely because they set boundaries could be seen as the asshole move here. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own desires and financial loss over her comfort and consent. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's rude and leaves the other person confused. Even if he's not interested anymore, a clear communication would be better. But the core issue is his attitude towards her decision, which might be more important than the ghosting itself.\n"
