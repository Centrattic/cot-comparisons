We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting Casey because she didn't sleep with him on the first date. So, he asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place, and she said no. Then he lost interest, didn't respond much, and now is ghosting her. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and can be hurtful. Even if he's not interested anymore, cutting off communication completely without explanation might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nHe mentioned he's honest, which is good, but his approach here seems a bit transactional. He thought it was an \"easy sell\" and focused on the money spent. That might come off as using her or not valuing the relationship beyond physical expectations. When she said no, his response was to disengage, which could be seen as respecting her boundaries but also as not being mature in handling rejection.\n\nHe's using the \"not in the wrong\" argument because he lost interest, but the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014could be problematic. People usually expect some level of communication, even if they're not interested anymore. His lack of response might hurt her feelings, especially since she's shown interest and tried to stay in touch.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his feelings. If he truly has no interest now, he might not be the asshole for moving on, but the method of moving on (ghosting) is the issue. So maybe he's not entirely wrong for losing interest, but the way he handled the break-off is where he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering both aspects, the answer might be A (wrong) because of ghosting, but there's nuance. The core question is whether the action (ghosting) is the asshole move. Since the user is justifying it by his loss of interest, but the act itself is considered rude, the answer leans towards A.\n"
