We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The scenario is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and respect. The user asked directly if she wanted to go back to his place, and she said no. Respecting her boundaries is crucial here. If he's ghosting her because she didn't comply with his expectations of physical intimacy, that's a problem. Relationships should be based on mutual respect, not just physical desires. \n\nHe mentions that he thought it was an \"easy sell\" because he believed she had a crush on him. Assuming someone's feelings and then being upset when they don't act on them isn't fair. It's important to communicate openly and not pressure someone into anything they're not comfortable with. \n\nHe also talks about the money spent on the date. Using finances as a reason to cut off someone who said no is not acceptable. That could be seen as transactional thinking, which is disrespectful. \n\nGhosting, in general, isn't a good practice because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. Even if he lost interest, a more mature approach would be to have an honest conversation about his feelings. \n\nSo, putting this together, the user's actions were disrespectful towards her boundaries, and his motivations were based on his own expectations and financial considerations. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
