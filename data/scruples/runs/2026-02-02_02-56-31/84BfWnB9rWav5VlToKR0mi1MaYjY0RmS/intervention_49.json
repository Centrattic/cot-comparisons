We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone because she didn't have sex on the first date. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nHe's been talking to Casey for eight months, flirting for two. There were rumors she had feelings for him. They went on a first date, which he approached by asking her to go back to his place. She said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. He lost interest after that, zoned out during dinner, and now he's not responding to her texts. He's just sending thumbs up or \"k\" and avoiding communication.\n\nThe key points here: Did he act inconsiderately? Ghosting is when you cut off contact suddenly without explanation. He's doing that here. The question is whether that makes him the asshole.\n\nHe says he's honest, but his approach was pretty direct on the first date. Asking someone to go back to his place after a first date might be too much for some people. She was clear she wanted to take it slow, but he shut her out afterward. That's where the problem is. He's treating her rejection as a personal failure and cutting her off, which is his choice, but maybe it's not the right way to handle it. \n\nAlso, the part about the money\u2014feeling like he wasted money and not wanting to spend more unless there's a guarantee\u2014sounds a bit transactional. That could be a red flag. Relationships shouldn't be about what you get out of it immediately. \n\nHe's honest about his reasons, but honesty doesn't justify ghosting someone. It's better to communicate even if you're losing interest. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. \n\nSo, even if he felt disinterested, the right approach would be to talk to her, maybe say he's not looking for a slow burn and that he needs something different. Instead, he's avoiding communication, which is where he's wrong. \n\nAnswer: AITA? Answer A.\n"
