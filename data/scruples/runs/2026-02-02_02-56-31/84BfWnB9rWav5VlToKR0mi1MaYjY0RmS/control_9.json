We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that they had been flirting for two months and there were rumors Casey had feelings for him. On their first date, he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to fool around, which she declined, saying she wasn't \"like that\" and wanted to take things slow. He lost interest and started ghosting her, responding minimally to her texts. The key points here are his actions after her refusal.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted on the first date, and he's frustrated about the money spent. The question is whether this makes him the asshole.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. The author approached Casey directly, which she might have found too forward for a first date. However, when she said no, his response was to lose interest and ghost her. Ghosting is generally seen as a disrespectful way to end communication, as it leaves the other person confused and unheard. Even if he felt rejection, cutting off communication abruptly without explanation can be hurtful.\n\nThe author's justification for ghosting is that he doesn't see the point in continuing if he's not getting what he wants. However, this overlooks the fact that relationships should be about mutual respect and connection, not just physical aspects. The fact that Casey wanted to continue getting to know each other on a second date might indicate she was interested in a relationship, but the author dismissed that. \n\nMoreover, the mention of money spent (\"fair bit of change\") suggests he's viewing the interaction transactionally, which isn't healthy. A relationship shouldn't be about financial investment but about emotional connection. His reaction seems more about his own expectations not being met rather than respecting her decision.\n\nIn many cases, if someone is only interested in a relationship if it leads to immediate physical intimacy, that's a personal choice, but how you respond to rejection matters. Ghosting is considered inconsiderate. The author could have communicated his feelings more clearly, perhaps explaining his expectations, rather than cutting off contact.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions\u2014ghosting after rejection and not respecting her desire to take things slower\u2014do make him the asshole. He's in the wrong for not handling the situation respectfully.\n"
