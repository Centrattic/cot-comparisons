We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for ghosting someone because she didn't want to have sex on the first date. Hmm. So first, the background: they've known Casey for 8 months, flirted for 2, and rumors of her having feelings for 5-6 months. They had their first date, did the normal stuff, and he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to fool around. She said no, not tonight, and said she likes him but wants things to develop. He then zoned out, didn't respond well, and after the date, he hasn't been in touch, just minimal responses. Now, he's wondering if he's the asshole for ghosting her.\n\nSo the key points here. He approached her about sex on the first date, she said no, and he lost interest, leading to him cutting off communication. The question is whether that makes him the asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations in dating. It's generally considered respectful to respect someone's boundaries. If she said no, even if he was interested in a physical relationship, he should respect her decision. However, he feels like he lost interest after she declined. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014could be problematic. Ghosting is often seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nAnother angle is his attitude. He mentions spending money on the date and feeling like it was a waste. His focus seems to be on getting what he wants (sex) rather than building a relationship. That might come off as transactional or disrespectful. \n\nHe also says he's not trying to hurt her, but his actions do hurt her. She's reaching out, showing concern, and he's ignoring her. That's not considerate. Even if he's lost interest, a better approach would be to communicate that respectfully rather than cutting her off completely.\n\nBut in terms of his personal feelings, he's honest about losing interest. However, the expectation that a date should lead to sex immediately might be unrealistic. Not everyone is comfortable with that, and expecting someone to \"put out\" on the first date is a common but flawed assumption. If he's only interested in a physical relationship, he might need to have that conversation upfront. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting her decision is key. If he can't accept her boundaries and instead punishes her by ghosting, that's not fair. So even if he's not in the wrong for losing interest, his actions in ghosting are wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be that he is in the wrong (A) because he ghosted her without explanation, didn't respect the connection she wanted to build, and his approach to the date was transactional. Ghosting is generally considered rude regardless of the reason. Even if he's not interested anymore, he should have communicated that clearly.\n"
