We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations for immediate physical intimacy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. Even if the author isn't intentionally hurting her, it's still a lack of respect for her feelings.\n\nNext, the context: the author asked directly if they could go back to his place, and she said no. He then zoned out during the rest of the date, focused on the money spent, and later stopped responding. The key points here are his assumption that she would agree to sex, his decision to disengage after her refusal, and the lack of communication.\n\nIn many cultures, people are expected to have some level of mutual respect and honesty in relationships. The author's actions show a prioritization of his own desires over her boundaries. By not engaging in a respectful conversation about his feelings, he's avoiding accountability. His justification based on \"spending money\" also suggests a transactional view of the date, which isn't healthy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that he's honest and straightforward. However, honesty doesn't excuse ghosting. If he had to say he wasn't interested anymore, even if it's awkward, that would be more respectful. The fact that he's responding with minimal texts but not engaging fully shows a lack of maturity in handling rejection.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might have had different expectations about the date. But expecting someone to have sex on the first date is not a universal standard. Respecting her decision to wait is important, and moving on without communication is the problem here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful. Even if he feels justified, his behavior is in the wrong because ghosting is a form of emotional neglect. The answer should be A.\n"
