We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey. The situation is that the author asked her to go back to his place after the first date, and she said no. He lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving her thumbs up or \"k\" when she texts. He's questioning if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author approached Casey directly about wanting to have sex on the first date. She declined, saying she wants to take things slower. The author then ghosted her, not responding to her messages. He mentions he spent money on the date and felt it was a waste, which influenced his decision to cut off communication.\n\nEthically, relationships and dating involve mutual respect. Pressuring someone for sex on the first date isn't appropriate, and respecting her decision is important. The author, however, didn't respect her boundaries and lost interest, which shows a lack of genuine interest in a relationship. Ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on his own expectations and investment (money, time) rather than respecting Casey's feelings and decisions. Even if he felt rejected, walking away completely without explanation is dismissive of her feelings. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual understanding, not treating people as means to an end. The author's actions indicate he valued his own desires over hers, which is problematic. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. He didn't respect her decision and chose to ghost instead of having an honest conversation about his feelings. Even if he's honest, that doesn't excuse ghosting. So, the answer should be A.\n"
