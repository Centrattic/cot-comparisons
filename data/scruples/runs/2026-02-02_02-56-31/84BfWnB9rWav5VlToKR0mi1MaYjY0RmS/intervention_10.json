We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a first date, he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" she said no, and then he lost interest. He's been ignoring her texts since then, just giving minimal responses. He's justifying it because he thought she had a crush on him for months, so he expected an easy \"yes,\" and now he's upset about the money spent and the lack of reciprocation.\n\nThe key points here are communication, respect, and assumptions. He approached her with a direct question about sex on the first date, which might not be the best approach. Then, when she said no, instead of respecting her boundaries and continuing to build a relationship, he ghosted her. That's a big red flag. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nHe mentions that she's been texting him since, trying to reach out, but he's avoiding her. Even if he's not interested anymore, a proper response would be to be honest and let her know he's not interested without being abrupt. His reasoning about the money is also a bit selfish and not a valid reason for ghosting. \n\nThe fact that he thought it was an \"easy sell\" because she had a crush on him for months shows a lack of understanding that people can have crushes without being physically interested. Everyone has different comfort levels and boundaries, and a first date isn't always the right time to push for intimacy. \n\nSo, the main issues here are his approach to asking for physical intimacy too soon, his reaction to her refusal, and the ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, so he's probably in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
