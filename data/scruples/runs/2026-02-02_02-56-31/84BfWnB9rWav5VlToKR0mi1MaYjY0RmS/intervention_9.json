  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for ghosting her after she wouldn't put out?\nSo, I've known this girl Casey for about 8 months now. We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex with him on the first date. Hmm. So, the guy set up a date, asked her directly if they could go back to his place and fool around, she said no, and he lost interest. Now he's not responding to her texts beyond a thumbs up or a \"k\".\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both angles. The guy felt that since she had a crush on him for months, he thought it would be an \"easy sell\" to have sex on the first date. But she was clear that she wanted to take things slower. The problem here is that he approached her with a very direct question about having sex, and when she declined, he shut down and didn't engage with her anymore. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. \n\nOn the other hand, he mentions that he's honest and values honesty, so maybe he thought he was being upfront. But expecting someone to be okay with immediate physical intimacy can be problematic. It's important to respect someone's boundaries and their decisions. If she's not comfortable with moving that quickly, the appropriate response is to accept that and continue building the relationship, not to cut off communication entirely. \n\nSo, even though he's not trying to hurt her, the act of ghosting is inconsiderate. He's not respecting her choice by ignoring her subsequent attempts to talk. The fact that he's focusing on the money spent as a reason might also indicate a transactional view of the date, which isn't healthy. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her decision and chose to ghost instead of having a mature conversation about their differing expectations.\n"
