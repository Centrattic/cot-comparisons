We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The story goes that they've known each other for 8 months, flirted for 2, and Casey had a crush for 5-6 months. On the first date, he asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place to fool around. She said no, not tonight, and that she liked him and wanted to take it slow. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and ghosted her.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about the author's actions and his reasoning. He was honest but maybe too direct. First dates can be tricky, but pressuring someone for sex right away might not be the best approach. Casey said no, and the author took it personally, leading him to cut off communication. \n\nI need to consider consent and respect. The author's main issue is that he expected a 'yes' and got a 'no', which led to him disengaging. But respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. If he only wanted to be with her if she agreed to sex immediately, that's his problem, not hers. Ghosting is generally considered rude and dismissive, regardless of the reason. \n\nAlso, he mentions losing interest because of the money spent. That seems like a petty reason. The value of a relationship shouldn't be measured by financial investment. He's treating her decision to take things slow as a personal rejection rather than a valid boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's being honest about his preferences. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014is where the issue lies. Open communication would have been better than cutting her off abruptly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision, acted on his own desires without considering hers, and ghosting is disrespectful. The answer should be A.\n"
