  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for ghosting her after she wouldn't put out?\nSo, I've known this girl Casey for about 8 months now. We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with them on the first date. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nHe's been talking to Casey for 8 months, flirting for 2 months. She had a crush on him for 6 months. First date, they went to dinner, movie, etc. He asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" which she declined, saying no to that first date and said to wait till a second date. He got awkward and zoned out. Then, after the date, he didn't respond much and now just replies with short texts. He feels like he lost interest because she didn't \"put out,\" and he's not interested in continuing because he spent money and doesn't want to risk another date without getting what he wants. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. So, morally, socially, what's the right approach here? Ghosting someone usually refers to cutting off communication without explanation. But in this case, he hasn't completely cut off\u2014she texts him and he responds minimally. Maybe he's not ghosting in the traditional sense but is disengaging. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, respect is key. If he approached her directly and she said no, then he's supposed to respect her boundaries. His response was to lose interest and cut her off because she didn't meet his expectations. That's a problem. Expecting someone to sleep with you on the first date isn't reasonable for many people. Also, her wanting to take things slower is her right. \n\nHe's admitting that he ghosted her (or is doing so) because she didn't comply with his desires. That's not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's honest, pressuring someone for sex on the first date can be seen as inappropriate. The fact that he's focusing on the money spent is also a bit self-centered. Relationships shouldn't be transactional like that. \n\nSocially, people have different boundaries. If she's clear about wanting to take things slow, and he can't accept that, it's his issue. Ghosting her because she said no could be seen as disrespectful. Even if he's not interested anymore, a mature approach would be to explain that he's not interested in moving forward, rather than cutting her off abruptly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, his main wrongdoings are: 1) assuming she would say yes to sex on the first date, 2) pressuring her, 3) disengaging without a proper explanation, which could hurt her feelings. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
