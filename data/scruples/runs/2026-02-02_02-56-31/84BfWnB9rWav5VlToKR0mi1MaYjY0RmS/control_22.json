We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting after the first date when the girl didn't agree to have sex. \n\nFirst, the author set up a date and was direct about wanting to have sex. The girl turned him down, saying she wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and didn't engage further. He cites reasons like feeling like he wasted money and lost interest.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. Was the author wrong? Well, communication is a big part of relationships. The author was honest about his intentions upfront, which is good. But the girl had different expectations. By ghosting, he's cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. Even if he lost interest, ghosting isn't a respectful way to handle it. He should have been clear about his feelings or given a reason for stepping back. Also, the fact that he was focused on the cost of the date and getting what he wanted might show a lack of respect for her boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his intentions. If he wasn't okay with taking things slower, maybe he shouldn't have pursued a relationship that wasn't aligned with his expectations. But the way he handled the rejection\u2014ghosting\u2014is where the issue lies. People have different comfort levels, and respecting someone's decision, even if it's not what you want, is important. The author's reaction seems more about his own disappointment and financial loss rather than considering her feelings. So, he's in the wrong because he didn't handle the rejection respectfully and chose to disappear instead of having an open conversation.\n"
