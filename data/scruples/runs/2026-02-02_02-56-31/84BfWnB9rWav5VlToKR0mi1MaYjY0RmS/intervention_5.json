We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex with him on the first date. He set up the situation where he asked her directly if they could go to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no. Then he lost interest and stopped responding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and respect in relationships. He approached her with a direct question about sex, which is a big deal. She said no, and he took that as a rejection, leading him to ghost her. The key points here are his honesty and her boundaries.\n\nHe mentions he's big on being honest, so he was upfront about his intentions. But respecting her \"no\" is crucial. If he's only interested in someone if they agree to sex on the first date, that's his issue, not hers. Ghosting because she didn't comply with his desires can be seen as disrespectful. It shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and her choice to take things slower.\n\nAlso, he's using the amount of money he spent as a justification. That's a common argument where people feel they've invested too much and expect a return, which is not a valid reason. Her decision to set boundaries isn't a transaction. \n\nHe's the one who initiated the conversation about sex, so he should have anticipated different responses. If he's not able to respect her decision, maybe he wasn't considering her feelings enough. Ghosting is hurtful regardless, and doing it because someone didn't meet his expectations is poor conduct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, he's in the wrong because he didn't respect her boundaries, used financial loss as an excuse, and ghosted her without communication. The answer should be A.\n"
