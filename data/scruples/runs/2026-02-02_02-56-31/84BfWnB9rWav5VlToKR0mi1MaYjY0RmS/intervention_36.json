  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for ghosting her after she wouldn't put out?\nSo, I've known this girl Casey for about 8 months now. We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone because she didn't have sex on the first date. He went on a date with Casey, asked if she wanted to go back to his place, she said no, and now he's not responding. He's justifying it by saying he lost interest and doesn't want to waste money again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and respect. She clearly said no, so maybe his reaction is inappropriate. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he's not interested anymore, disappearing without a conversation isn't kind.\n\nHe mentions she's had a crush for months, so maybe he should have considered her feelings. Also, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent might indicate a transactional view of the date, which isn't healthy. Relationships should be about mutual respect, not just his needs.\n\nOn the other hand, he feels like he put all his cards on the table and was honest. But honesty shouldn't come at the expense of respecting her boundaries. Everyone has different comfort levels, and she was clear about her limits. His decision to ghost might show immaturity in handling rejection.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect some communication if they're cutting things off. Ghosting can be hurtful. The fact that she's reached out and he's ignoring her messages could make it worse. So, he might be in the wrong for not addressing his feelings in a respectful way.\n"
