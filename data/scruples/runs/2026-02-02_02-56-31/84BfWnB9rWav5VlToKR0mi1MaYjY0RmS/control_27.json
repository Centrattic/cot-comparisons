We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy and Casey have known each other for 8 months, with flirting going on for 2 months. There were rumors she had feelings for him longer. They went on their first date, did typical things like a movie and dinner. He was honest and asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" He thought she was interested since she had a crush, but she said no, and said she wanted to take things slower. He then zoned out during dinner, thinking about the money spent, and after the date ended, he gave her a limp hug and didn't respond to her texts. He's been ghosting her because she didn't sleep with him on the first date, and he lost interest. He mentions he doesn't want to waste money again if there's a chance she won't go all in the next time.\n\nSo the main question is whether he's the asshole here. Well, the key points are communication and respect. He was honest about his intentions upfront, which is good. But he expected her to agree to sex on the first date, and when she didn't, he lost interest and cut her off. That seems dismissive of her boundaries. Even if he was clear about his wants, she was clear about hers. Ghosting is a big deal because it's cutting communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. He also mentions he's not interested in continuing the relationship, but maybe he should have addressed that directly instead of ghosting. His focus on the money spent is a red flag, suggesting he saw the date as an investment for something else rather than a genuine connection. Also, giving a limp air hug and avoiding her texts shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. So even if he's honest about his feelings, the way he handled it is problematic. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's ghosting and not respecting her decision to take it slow, plus the money issue shows he's prioritizing his own satisfaction over her comfort and the relationship's potential.\n"
