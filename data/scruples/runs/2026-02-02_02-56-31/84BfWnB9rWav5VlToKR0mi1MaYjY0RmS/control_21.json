We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author went on a first date with Casey. They had been flirting for two months and there were rumors she liked him. During the date, he asked her to go back to his place for sex. She said no, not tonight, and mentioned she wanted things to develop. The author felt rejected, zoned out for most of the date, and after spending money, he lost interest and hasn't replied to her texts beyond minimal responses. He argues he's not doing it to hurt her but because he lost interest after the rejected advance.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethical standards. In many cultures, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if the author thought there was mutual interest, he initiated a request for physical intimacy. When she refused, the appropriate response would be to respect her decision. Ghosting her afterward, especially because she didn't comply with his expectations, could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. The fact that he focused on the financial aspect (\"spent a fair bit of change\") suggests his priorities might be more about his own desires and expenses than her well-being.\n\nThe author's actions of not responding beyond brief messages are ghosting, which can be hurtful. Even if he felt rejected, cutting off communication abruptly without explanation is generally considered inconsiderate. The key issue here is whether he valued her autonomy and feelings. Since he didn't respect her decision and chose to abandon the interaction, that's where the argument for him being in the wrong stands.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different expectations in dating. If the author is honest about his intentions and she clearly communicated her boundaries, maybe some might say he's in the right if he's not interested in continuing. However, the main criticism would be about how he handled the situation after her refusal. The decision to completely ghost her, rather than having an open conversation about his feelings, is the problematic part. So, the answer is likely A, he is in the wrong.\n"
