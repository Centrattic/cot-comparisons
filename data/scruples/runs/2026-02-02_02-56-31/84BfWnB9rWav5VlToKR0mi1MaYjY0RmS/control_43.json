We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, the author went on a date with Casey after she had a crush on him for months. He thought she was interested, so he asked her to go back to his place. She said no, and he lost interest. Now he's ghosting her, not responding beyond minimal texts.\n\nThe question is about whether he's the asshole. From a moral standpoint, ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. People often expect some level of respect even if things don't work out. The author mentions that he lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations, but that doesn't justify ignoring her. \n\nHe also brings up the cost of the date, which might indicate he's more focused on the financial aspect than her feelings. This could reflect poor judgment, as valuing the expense over her feelings might be seen as selfish. However, the situation is complicated by his personal expectations. If he was upfront about his intentions and she didn't meet them, he might feel justified, but communication is key. Instead of ghosting, a better approach would be to have an honest conversation about his feelings. \n\nSo, while his actions are hurtful and disrespectful, whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on societal norms around communication and respect in dating. Ghosting is typically frowned upon, so he's probably the asshole here.\n"
