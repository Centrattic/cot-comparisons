We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The user is asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having a crush for longer. They went on a first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author directly asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" but she said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest and started ghosting her, responding minimally to her texts. He mentions feeling like he wasted money and lost all interest because she didn't give him what he wanted.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and respect. The author was upfront about his intentions, which is honest, but maybe too focused on physical relations from the start. When she declined, he didn't engage further, which could be seen as dismissive. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. The author's main reason for losing interest was her not complying with his expectations, which might indicate that his interest was conditional on getting physical, rather than being interested in a relationship.\n\nSociety often frowns upon ghosting because it's abrupt and lacks communication. Even if the author felt rejected, cutting off contact without explaining is inconsiderate. The fact that Casey reached out afterward shows she was interested in continuing, but the author's response was dismissive. The financial aspect he mentions is a bit of an afterthought; while he might feel it was a loss, that shouldn't be the sole factor in how he treats someone.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was honest about his intentions, and if Casey didn't meet them, he's within his rights to not pursue further. However, the way he handled the rejection is what's in question. Ghosting isn't the best approach. A more respectful way would be to explain that he's not interested anymore, even if it's because of the rejection. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for losing interest, but the act of ghosting without communication makes him the asshole. People have different boundaries, and while the author's interest was conditional on physical relations, his lack of follow-up communication is the main issue. Therefore, he is in the wrong for ghosting.\n"
