We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who ghosted Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The question is whether the author (AITA) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The user provided a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" story. The key points are that the author asked Casey to go back to his place after their first date, she said no, and then he lost interest, stopped responding, and didn't reply to her texts. He just gives thumbs up or \"k\" to her messages now. He's justifying it by saying he lost all interest because she didn't \"put out\" on the first date and mentions money spent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nIn terms of social norms, respect in relationships is important. Ghosting someone after they set a boundary can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. The author's reasoning is that he didn't get what he wanted sexually, so he decided to cut off communication. That's a red flag because it shows a lack of respect for her decision and her autonomy. People have different boundaries and expectations, and a healthy relationship should involve mutual respect and consideration beyond just physical intimacy.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he's honest and that he's not interested in continuing if the physical aspect isn't there. But the problem here is that he didn't communicate his expectations clearly before the date. He asked bluntly about fooling around, which Casey declined. Then, instead of having an open conversation about their differing expectations, he chose to ghost her. That's not a mature or respectful way to handle a situation where expectations aren't met. He could have discussed his feelings instead of cutting her off abruptly.\n\nAlso, the mention of money spent (\"fair bit of change\") adds another layer, suggesting that his decision might be influenced by financial considerations rather than just his feelings. This could be seen as transactional and disrespectful, treating the relationship as a cost-benefit analysis.\n\nIn most ethical frameworks, respect for autonomy and honesty in communication are key. Ghosting without explanation is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. The author's actions could be seen as emotionally abusive because he's punishing Casey for not meeting his expectations and then disappearing without addressing the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, if Casey was clear from the start that she wanted things to develop slowly and the author knew that, maybe there's a different perspective. But according to the story, the author thought he had a \"done deal\" because of the rumors of her having a crush. However, Casey explicitly stated she wasn't \"like that\" and wanted to take it slow. The author's failure to respect her boundary and his subsequent ghosting is where the problem lies.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is at fault for not respecting her decision, not communicating his needs properly, and ghosting instead of addressing the situation maturely. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
