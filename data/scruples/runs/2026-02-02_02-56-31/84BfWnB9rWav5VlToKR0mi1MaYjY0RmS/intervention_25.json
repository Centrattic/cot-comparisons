We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user set up a date, asked directly if she wanted to go back to his place, and she said no. He thought he had a \"done deal\" because there were rumors she liked him. When she declined, he zoned out during the rest of the date and then stopped responding, giving her the cold shoulder. He cites that he didn't want to invest more time or money without getting what he wanted, which seems to be the main issue here.\n\nNow, considering the context, the user's actions might be seen as respectful or not. If he was clear about his intentions and she wasn't okay with it, then he might have a right to feel disinterested. But on the flip side, ghosting someone after one date, especially when the other person is still interested, could be seen as inconsiderate. The user mentions losing all interest because she said no, but that might be more about his own expectations not being met rather than her being a bad person.\n\nHe also mentions the financial aspect, which is a bit of a red flag. Prioritizing money over the other person's feelings might make people think he's not mature. Also, the fact that she reached out afterward and he ignored her could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual respect, if he approached her directly and she said no, he should respect that. But his decision to cut her off completely after one date, without trying to salvage the relationship or even have an honest conversation, might be where he's in the wrong. People often have different expectations, and maybe he assumed she should know what he wanted without clear communication. However, it's also okay to not want to pursue someone if your expectations aren't met, but doing it in a ghosting manner is probably not the best approach.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did he respect her no? It seems like he didn't necessarily disrespect it, but he lost interest. Is ghosting acceptable? Generally, no, because it leaves the other person in the dark. Should he have communicated his feelings instead? Yes. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being upfront and for the ghosting, even if his reasons were personal.\n"
