We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. The scenario is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for him for longer. On their first date, he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies. He justifies it by saying he spent money on the date and doesn't want to invest more if there's no sexual reward.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and ethical standards. Respect in relationships is key. The author's approach was to ask for sex on the first date, which some might find too forward, but it's his choice. However, Casey's refusal was her right, and the author's response was to ghost her, which is generally considered rude and dismissive. Ghosting is often seen as a lack of respect because the other person is left without closure. The author's focus on the financial cost and his own interests might come off as selfish. \n\nHe claims he's not trying to hurt her, but his actions do cause emotional distress. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and communication. By cutting off contact abruptly and ignoring her follow-up messages, he's not being respectful of her boundaries or feelings. Even if he's not interested anymore, a polite explanation would be better than ghosting. \n\nAdditionally, the premise that sex is the primary goal might influence his judgment. Wanting a romantic connection without the intention of building a relationship beyond physical aspects can lead to one-sided expectations. Casey wanted to take things slower, which is valid, but the author's reaction was to disengage entirely, which isn't fair. \n\nIn summary, while the author's actions stem from his own desires and expectations, his response of ghosting is inconsiderate and disrespectful. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
