We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. They knew her for 8 months, had been flirting for 2, and went on their first date. They asked directly if they could go back to his place, which she said no to. Then he lost interest and started ghosting her.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The user's perspective is that he's honest, wanted to be upfront, and when she said no, he lost all interest. He mentions he spent money on the date and doesn't want to invest more if there's no chance of sex. On the other hand, Casey might have wanted a slower pace, and the user's reaction could be seen as dismissive and hurtful.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he lost interest, ending the relationship abruptly like that can be hurtful. Also, the user's reasoning is focused on his own desires and financial loss, which might come off as self-centered. He didn't consider her feelings or the possibility that she wanted to build a connection first. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect that physical intimacy isn't expected too quickly. Respecting someone's boundaries is important. By ghosting, he didn't give her the courtesy of a real conversation. Even if he felt rejected, it's better to communicate and part ways respectfully. \n\nSo, while his honesty is commendable, his follow-up action of ghosting without addressing his feelings and the situation properly makes him the asshole. He didn't respect her decision and acted in a way that could leave her confused or hurt. Also, valuing the interaction based on financial cost is not a healthy approach. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong). He should have communicated his feelings properly instead of ghosting.\n"
