We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author set up a date, asked directly if they could go back to his place, and she said no. He then lost interest, didn't respond much, and ghosted her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. The guy was upfront about his intentions, but she wanted to take things slower. He respected her initial \"no\" but then didn't follow up. However, he's now cutting her off completely, which might be seen as dismissive.\n\nValues like respect and communication are important here. Even if he's disappointed, he should communicate his feelings instead of ghosting. She's made efforts to reach out, and ignoring her is hurtful. Also, expecting physical intimacy on the first date might be a personal preference, but others might find that too soon. His reaction of losing interest because she didn't comply could be seen as shallow, valuing physical attraction over getting to know her.\n\nFinancial aspect: He mentions money spent on the date, but that shouldn't dictate the relationship. Using money as a reason to ghost is not a good justification. \n\nIn many cultures, it's acceptable to have different expectations, but the way to handle rejection is key. The author's approach of ghosting without explanation is likely the issue here. People might argue that he's being inconsiderate, not allowing her to express her feelings further or build a relationship beyond the physical aspect.\n\nSo, the consensus is probably that he's in the wrong for ghosting and not communicating his feelings properly. The answer should be A.\n"
