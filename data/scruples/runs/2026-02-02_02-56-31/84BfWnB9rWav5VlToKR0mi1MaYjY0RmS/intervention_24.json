We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. So, the scenario is that they went on a first date, they asked her to go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest and stopped responding. The key points here are about respecting boundaries and communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around dating and relationships. In many cultures, there's an expectation that people should communicate clearly and respect each other's boundaries. The user was honest about his intentions upfront, which is good. But when she said no, his response was to ghost her because he lost interest. That's where the potential issue lies.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if he's not interested anymore, it's better to communicate that than to cut off contact abruptly. The fact that she's reached out afterward and he's only responding minimally suggests he's avoiding communication, which isn't respectful.\n\nAlso, the reasoning about her not meeting his expectations (wanting sex on the first date) might be his personal preference, but that doesn't excuse the ghosting. Everyone has different comfort levels, and her decision to wait isn't something to be judged. The user's reaction seems more about his own frustration and financial investment rather than respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together: he's wrong for ghosting. The answer should be A.\n"
