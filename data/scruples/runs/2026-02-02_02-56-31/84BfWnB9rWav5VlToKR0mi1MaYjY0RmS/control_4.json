We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author approached Casey, they had been flirting for a while, and there were rumors she had feelings. On the first date, he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not that night, and said they should take it slow. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies. He's justifying it by saying he lost interest and doesn't want to spend more money on dates if there's no chance of getting physical.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, respect is key here. Even if the author felt rejected, cutting off communication entirely (ghosting) is generally considered disrespectful. People have the right to set boundaries, and Casey was clear she wasn't comfortable with that yet. The author's response of losing interest because she said no shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and feelings. Also, using the money spent as a reason is a bit of an excuse. Relationships shouldn't be transactional, and if someone isn't interested in moving forward, they should communicate that clearly rather than just disappearing. The fact that Casey has reached out and he's not responding properly adds to the problem. He could've been honest about not wanting to continue, instead of ghosting. So, yeah, he's in the wrong.\n"
