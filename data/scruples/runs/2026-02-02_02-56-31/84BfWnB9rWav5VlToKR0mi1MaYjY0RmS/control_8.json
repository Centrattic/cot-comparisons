We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) subreddit style question.\n\nThe author had known Casey for 8 months, with flirting for 2 months and rumors of her having a crush for 5-6 months. They went on a first date, had dinner and a movie. The author was upfront about wanting to fool around, but she said no, and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and only gave minimal replies when she tried to reach out.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: Ghosting usually means cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. The author explains they lost interest because Casey didn't meet their expectation of having sex on the first date. They mention spending money on the date and feeling like it was a waste. \n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships. Expecting sex on the first date isn't typical for many people, and wanting to pace things is her choice. The author's approach was to ask bluntly, which might have been too direct. The key issue is that the author decided to ghost her because she didn't comply with their expectations. That's a problem because respect and communication are important in relationships. Ghosting without explanation is generally seen as a lack of respect.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't see the point in continuing if there's no immediate physical intimacy. However, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The fact that Casey was clear about her boundaries and the author didn't respect that by cutting off communication makes the author at fault. They didn't handle the rejection maturely. Additionally, the mention of money being a factor is a red flag, as it suggests the author valued their own expenditure over her feelings and boundaries.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often hinges on whether someone acted with respect and consideration. The author's actions\u2014ghosting, not responding, and dismissing her attempts to communicate\u2014are typically seen as the asshole's move. They didn't address their feelings openly and instead cut her off, which is hurtful and uncommunicative.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they ghosted someone who had set clear boundaries, failed to communicate their feelings, and prioritized their own desires over mutual respect.\n"
