We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting after the girl said no. The situation is that they went on a first date, he asked her to go back to his place, she refused, and he lost interest, so he's been ignoring her texts.\n\nHmm. Well, relationships and dating can be tricky. The guy's actions seem a bit abrupt. Ghosting is when you cut off all communication without explanation. He said he's texting her with just thumbs up and \"k\", which is pretty much ghosting. But why? Because she said no to fooling around. That seems a bit transactional. Wait, he mentions he was looking for something casual since he's asking to \"fool around\" on the first date. But she wanted to take things slower. So he didn't respect her boundaries when she said no. That's a problem. Even if he's honest about his intentions, pressuring someone for physical intimacy on the first date isn't great. Then, when she declines, he ghosts her, which is rude and inconsiderate. She's reaching out to check in, but he's ignoring her. That's definitely not cool. So even if he's honest, the way he's handling the rejection is wrong. He's prioritizing his own needs and spending, which is selfish. So the answer is probably A, he's in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Like, maybe he's being honest about his intentions. But even so, if someone isn't into it, you don't just cut them off. You should at least communicate your feelings. So yeah, he's the asshole here.\n"
