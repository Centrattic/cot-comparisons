We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nHe's known Casey for 8 months, been flirting for 2, and there were rumors she liked him. They went on a first date, and he asked directly if they could go back to his place. She said no, not tonight, and said she wanted things to develop. He lost interest, didn't reply much after, and just ghosted her. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether his actions were wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he lost interest, not responding at all could hurt her feelings. She did say she liked him and wanted to take things slower, so maybe he didn't handle it well. He also mentions spending money, which might indicate he was focused on getting something in return rather than building a relationship. \n\nBut he's honest about his intentions, which is a point in his favor. However, the way he handled the rejection\u2014ignoring her texts and not explaining\u2014seems harsh. The key here is whether his actions were disrespectful. Ghosting is usually seen as disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. So even if his feelings changed, not communicating is probably wrong. \n\nAlso, assuming she's not \"like that\" based on one night might be a misunderstanding. She might have different values or wants a more meaningful connection. His approach was very direct, and when she said no, he shut down. That could be seen as not respecting her boundaries or feelings. \n\nSo the answer would likely be A, he's in the wrong. He should have communicated his feelings instead of ghosting. Even if he doesn't want to pursue it, a simple explanation would be better. The fact that she's reaching out and he's not responding with more than a thumbs up shows he's not being considerate of her feelings.\n"
