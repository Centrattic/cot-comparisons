We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user asked if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. First, I need to consider the context they provided.\n\nThey've known Casey for 8 months, flirting for 2 months, and there were rumors she had a crush. The first date was dinner and a movie. He asked directly if they could go to his place, she said no, and he lost interest. He's been ignoring her texts since then. His reasoning is that he lost all interest because she didn't give him what he wanted, and he doesn't want to spend more money on dates without getting that.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are consent, communication, and respect. Ghosting is generally seen as a disrespectful way to cut contact. Even if he's honest about his preferences, pressuring someone for sex on the first date can be problematic. The fact that he felt entitled to her body and then ghosted her because she said no suggests a lack of respect for her boundaries. Also, spending money and then cutting her off because she didn't meet his expectations might be selfish. It's important to consider that people have different comfort levels, and wanting to \"earn\" sex isn't fair. The user's actions were dismissive and potentially hurtful, so he's likely the asshole here.\n"
