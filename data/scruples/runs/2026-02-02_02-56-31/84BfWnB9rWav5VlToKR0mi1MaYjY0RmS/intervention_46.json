We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. So, first, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nHe had a date with Casey after a few months of flirting. He asked her if they could go back to his place, but she said no and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest, stopped engaging during the date, and hasn't responded much since. He's justifying it by saying he lost interest and doesn't want to waste money again. \n\nNow, the key points here. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it cuts off communication without explanation. The user's reasoning is that he's only interested in a sexual relationship, and since she didn't meet his expectations on the first date, he's not interested anymore. But is that a valid reason? Well, it's his prerogative to know his boundaries, but the way he handled it is the issue. \n\nHe didn't communicate his feelings or expectations. He made a blunt move for sex, which might have been too soon for her. She was clear she wanted to take things slow, but he then ghosted her instead of having an honest conversation. The fact that he's not responding to her texts and just giving minimal responses shows a lack of respect for her feelings. \n\nAlso, his focus on the money spent might be a red flag. Using financial reasons to justify his actions could indicate that he's more focused on his own investment than her feelings or consent. Consent and mutual interest are crucial, and he's treating her decision as a failure rather than respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, while he has the right to know what he wants, the way he handled it by ghosting without explanation is wrong. The correct approach would have been to talk to her and say he's not interested in continuing if she wants things slower. Ghosting is harmful and inconsiderate regardless of the reason. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
