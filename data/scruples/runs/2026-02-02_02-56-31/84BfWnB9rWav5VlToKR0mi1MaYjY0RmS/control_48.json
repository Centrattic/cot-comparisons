We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is that the two have been flirting for a while, went on a first date, and the author tried to get her to go back to his place but she said no. Now he's cutting her off because he's lost interest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Ghosting is generally considered rude because you stop all communication without explanation. The author didn't respond to her texts, which could be hurtful. But why did he ghost? Because she didn't meet his expectations for physical intimacy. Is it wrong to lose interest if the person didn't comply with his desires? Well, everyone has different boundaries and expectations. If the author was clear about his intentions upfront, then maybe it's on her if she wasn't interested. However, relationships should be mutual, and if he was only interested in a specific outcome, maybe he's the one with issues.\n\nAlso, the author mentions spending money on the date, which he's now regretting. That seems a bit self-centered. The value of a relationship shouldn't be measured in monetary terms. Plus, expecting someone to have sex on the first date isn't reasonable for many people. Respecting her decision is important. The author's reaction is to cut her off completely, which might be harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to have an open conversation about expectations instead of ghosting.\n\nOn the other hand, people do have the right to change their mind about someone if their expectations aren't met. But ghosting is a poor way to handle it. The key here is whether the author's actions were respectful. By not responding and cutting her off, he's being inconsiderate. Even if he's not interested anymore, a straightforward conversation would be more respectful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting out of self-interest and not considering her feelings. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate, so the answer is likely A, he's the asshole because his actions are disrespectful and he's not taking responsibility for his own expectations.\n"
