We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is that they had a date, he asked if they could go back to his place and she said no, then he lost interest and stopped communicating. He's saying he's not trying to hurt her, just that he doesn't see the point of continuing without immediate physical benefits. \n\nHmm, first, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Ghosting is generally seen as pretty rude because it leaves the other person without closure. The user admitted that he zoned out during the date after she said no, which might have been awkward for her. Then he didn't respond to her messages, just giving minimal responses. That's ghosting, right?\n\nHe mentions he's being honest, but honesty doesn't excuse ghosting. People can be honest in a respectful way. Also, his reasoning is that he's only interested in physical intimacy and didn't want to invest more time or money if there's no guarantee. But that's his own preference. He could have communicated that to her instead of cutting off communication. \n\nWhat about her perspective? She said she likes him and wants to take things slow. If he's only interested in a physical relationship, maybe they weren't compatible. But it's his responsibility to communicate his expectations. If he didn't make his intentions clear from the start, he can't blame her for not meeting his expectations later. \n\nGhosting is usually considered the asshole move because it's dismissive and inconsiderate. Even if he lost interest, a simple message explaining that he's not interested anymore would have been better. The fact that he's using the \"I'm not trying to hurt her\" defense doesn't mitigate the action; he still didn't communicate properly. \n\nFinancial aspects might not matter as much as emotional respect. He's focusing on the money spent, but that's not a valid reason to ghost someone. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is probably A (he's in the wrong) because ghosting is rude and he should have communicated his disinterest more respectfully. Even if his reasons are personal, the way he handled it is the issue.\n"
