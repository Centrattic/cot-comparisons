We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors she had a crush for 5-6 months. They went on a first date, which included dinner and a movie. The author bluntly asked if they could go back to his place to fool around, but she said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, didn't respond much, and now is ignoring her texts. He's justifying it by saying he doesn't want to waste money or time if there's no chance of sex again.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The main point is whether it's acceptable to ghost someone for not meeting your sexual expectations on the first date. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. The author admits he lost interest and doesn't want to talk, but Casey is making efforts to reach out.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's honest, but being honest doesn't justify ghosting. If he had no interest anymore, a respectful approach would be to explain his feelings instead of cutting her off. The fact that he's using financial reasons (money spent on the date) to justify this adds another layer of insensitivity. It's about his own needs and not considering her feelings or the fact that she wanted to continue building a relationship.\n\nAlso, pressuring someone for sex on the first date can be seen as inappropriate. She made it clear she wanted to take things slower, which is her right. The author's reaction of losing all interest because she didn't comply suggests he was only interested in a physical relationship, not in getting to know her. That's not necessarily wrong in terms of his preferences, but how he handled it is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014ghosting, not responding, and using the money as a reason\u2014are inconsiderate and hurtful. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
