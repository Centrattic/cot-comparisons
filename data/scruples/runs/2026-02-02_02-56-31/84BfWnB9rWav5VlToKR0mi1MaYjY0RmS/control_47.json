We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, the user is asking for an evaluation based on the given scenario. The author set up a date, asked directly if they could go back to his place to fool around, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped communicating. The key points here are consent, respect, and boundaries. \n\nIn many relationships and social interactions, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. The author's main issue seems to be that he wanted a physical relationship immediately, but Casey wanted to take things slower. By ghosting her, he's cutting off communication without addressing the issue, which can be hurtful. Even if he's honest about his needs, pressuring someone for sex after they say no is not acceptable. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being upset about the money spent on the date. That might indicate that his interest was more transactional, which isn't healthy. Ghosting after someone refuses his advances could be seen as disrespectful and immature. He should have communicated his feelings instead of disappearing. \n\nOn the flip side, he's being honest about his lack of interest now. However, the act of ghosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person without closure. Casey might feel rejected or confused. So while the author's actions stem from his own desires not being met, the way he handled it is problematic. \n\nOverall, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision and chose to ghost rather than have a mature conversation. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
