We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after she refused to have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a date with Casey. He asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said \"no, not tonight,\" and emphasized she's not \"like that,\" saying they should wait until the second date. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies to her texts. He justifies this by saying he spent money on the date and doesn't want to go through it again without getting what he wanted.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. In many cultures, there's an expectation that people should respect each other's boundaries. The author's main issue here is that Casey didn't meet his physical expectations on the first date, so he decided to cut her off. But that seems like using her rejection as a reason to end the interaction, which is not respectful. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's dismissive and inconsiderate. Even if someone's not into you, the proper response is to be honest and move on without cutting them off completely.\n\nAlso, the author's mindset is important. He mentions he thought it was an \"easy sell\" because she had a crush on him. That attitude shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. Everyone has the right to set their own boundaries, and a person's worth isn't determined by whether they engage in sexual activity. The fact that he's focusing on the money he \"wasted\" suggests he's viewing the date as an investment with an expected return, which is not a healthy or respectful approach to a relationship.\n\nMoreover, the idea that he \"lost all interest\" because she didn't sleep with him on the first date indicates that his interest was conditional on getting what he wanted. That's not a genuine interest in her as a person but rather in the physical aspect. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and connection beyond just physical desires.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that people have the right to their own preferences and that it's okay to move on if there's a mismatch. But ghosting is where the ethical line is drawn. If he was no longer interested, a better approach would be to communicate that respectfully rather than cutting her off. Also, the fact that she's reached out multiple times and he's not responding is more about his impatience than her behavior.\n\nAnother angle is that the author made a direct ask and she refused. He didn't pressure her but then decided to end the conversation. However, ending the interaction by ghosting is where the issue lies. It's not the refusal that's the problem, but the lack of consideration for her feelings afterward.\n\nIn summary, the author is being inconsiderate and dismissive. He's treating her rejection as a reason to end all communication, which is not respectful. Ghosting is often considered a negative behavior, so in this context, the author is in the wrong for not respecting her decision and for cutting her off without a proper explanation. The answer should be A.\n"
