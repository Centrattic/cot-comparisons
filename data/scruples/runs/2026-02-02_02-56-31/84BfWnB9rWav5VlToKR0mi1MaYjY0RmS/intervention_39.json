We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they had known each other for 8 months, with flirting going on for 2 months. There were rumors she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. Their first date included a movie and dinner. He asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no, preferring to wait until the second date. He then zoned out during the dinner, felt awkward, and after the date, he stopped communicating with her, responding minimally to her texts. He's now justifying it by saying he lost interest, didn't want to waste money again, and doesn't see the point of continuing if she's not going to sleep with him.\n\nHmm. The key points here are his motivations. He approached the date with the expectation of immediate physical intimacy, which she wasn't comfortable with. When she declined, he lost all interest and ghosted her. Now, he's questioning if he's the asshole for doing so.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, it's generally considered important to respect someone's boundaries. If someone says no to sex, especially early on in a relationship, the responsible choice is to respect that decision and not push further. However, the issue here is that instead of being respectful and ending things politely, he cut her off completely without communication. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nBut the user argues that he's not trying to hurt her, just that he lost interest. However, the underlying reason is that she didn't meet his expectations for physical intimacy, which might indicate that his interest was conditional on her agreeing to sex. That's a problematic approach because it suggests he wasn't interested in building a relationship but was focused on a specific outcome. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if he wasn't okay with her wanting to take things slower, he should have considered whether he was ready for a relationship that might not involve immediate physical intimacy. Ghosting, though, is not a mature way to handle a rejection. A better approach would have been to have an honest conversation about their differing expectations and part ways respectfully if they're not aligned.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he respected her decision by not pushing for sex, but his subsequent ghosting was inconsiderate. The problem isn't the lack of sex but the way he ended communication. People have different boundaries, and while it's okay to realize you're incompatible, cutting off contact without explanation is generally seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, he's in the wrong for ghosting, even if his initial action was respecting her no. The wrong is in the ghosting behavior, not the decision to not pursue a relationship if she's not interested.\n"
