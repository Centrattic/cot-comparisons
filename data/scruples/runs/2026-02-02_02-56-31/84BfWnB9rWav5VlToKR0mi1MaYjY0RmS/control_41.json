We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, the context: The guy and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for him for 5-6 months. They had their first date, which included dinner, a movie, etc. The guy directly asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" but she said no, not tonight. She said she wasn't \"like that\" and wanted to take it slow. The guy then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies. He's justifying it because he spent money and lost interest when she didn't give him what he wanted.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's the asshole. The key points here are communication and respect. The guy was honest about his intentions upfront, which is good, but he expected a certain outcome. When she declined, he shut down the relationship. The problem here is that he prioritized his own desires over respecting her boundaries and feelings. \n\nGhosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if he lost interest, cutting off communication entirely is dismissive and can be hurtful. Plus, he's using the excuse of spending money as a reason to cut her off, which isn't a valid justification. Relationships should be about mutual respect and emotional connection, not transactional value.\n\nShe made it clear she wanted to take things slower, which is her right. The guy's response was to devalue her by ghosting, which shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. Even if he's honest, it doesn't mean he's justified in treating her poorly. So, yes, he's in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision and ended things abruptly without consideration for her feelings.\n"
