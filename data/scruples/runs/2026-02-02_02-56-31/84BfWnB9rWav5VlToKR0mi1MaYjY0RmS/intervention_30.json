We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've known each other for 8 months, been flirting for 2, and she had a crush for 5-6 months. First date was dinner and a movie. He asked directly if they could go back to his place, she said no and wants to take it slow. He then zoned out, didn't respond well, and later ghosted her. He's cutting her off because he lost interest after she didn't give him what he wanted on the first date.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Is it okay to ghost someone for not meeting your sexual expectations? Well, in many relationships, people have different boundaries. She clearly communicated she wanted to take things slower. He expected sex, she didn't, and he's upset. \n\nBut is that his right to expect that? Probably not. It's not fair to assume someone is okay with sex on the first date just because they've been flirting. Also, being honest is good, but he might not have considered her perspective. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he's not interested, a polite goodbye would be better. Also, he's upset about the money spent, which might be a red flag for using her. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, he's in the wrong for ghosting without a clear reason and for prioritizing his own desires without respecting hers. The answer would be A.\n"
