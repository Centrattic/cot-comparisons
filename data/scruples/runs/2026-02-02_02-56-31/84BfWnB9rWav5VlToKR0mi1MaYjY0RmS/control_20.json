We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after they didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The guy, let's call him the author, had a date with Casey. He asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not that night, and suggested they take things slower. He thought he had a \"done deal\" because there were rumors she had feelings for him. After she said no, he zoned out during dinner, didn't respond well, and after the date, he stopped communicating with her, only giving minimal responses when she tried to reach out. He justifies it by saying he lost interest because she didn't \"put out\" and he doesn't want to waste money again without getting what he wanted.\n\nSo, the main question is whether ghosting her for this reason makes him an asshole. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, respect and communication are key in relationships. The author approached the date with the expectation of sexual activity, which he communicated bluntly. When she said no, he didn't respect her boundaries and instead of discussing his feelings or where they stood, he cut her off. That seems disrespectful. Everyone has the right to set their own boundaries, and pressuring someone for sex after they say no isn't acceptable. \n\nThe author also mentions spending money, which adds a transactional element. That could imply he viewed the date more as a means to an end (sex) rather than building a genuine connection. When she didn't meet his expectations, he decided she wasn't worth his time or money. This attitude can be problematic because it reduces the value of the relationship to physical aspects and financial cost, which isn't healthy.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author lost interest, ignoring her messages and not explaining his feelings is inconsiderate. A better approach would have been to have an honest conversation about his expectations and why he felt that way, even if it was awkward. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being honest about his desires and that if she didn't meet them, he's not obligated to continue the relationship. However, the way he handled the rejection and the subsequent ghosting is where the issue lies. \n\nIn many cultures and social norms, pressuring someone for sex after they decline is not acceptable. The author's behavior could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful towards Casey's boundaries. The fact that he thought he had a \"done deal\" because there were rumors about her feelings might also indicate a lack of genuine understanding of her consent and autonomy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision, reacted poorly by ghosting, and showed a transactional view of the relationship. The answer should be A.\n"
