We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both perspectives. The user went on a date with Casey, they had been flirting for a while, and he made a move to go back to his place. She declined, saying they should wait until the second date. The user then lost interest and hasn't responded much since. He's justifying it by saying he spent money and doesn't want to invest more time if there's no guarantee.\n\nFrom Casey's side, she expressed that she wanted to take things slower, which is her right. She's reached out after the date, showing concern. The user, however, stopped responding, which can be seen as ghosting. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the user felt rejected, cutting off communication abruptly is inconsiderate.\n\nThe user's reasoning here is that he lost interest, but that doesn't excuse the ghosting. People have different expectations in dating, and it's important to communicate. If he didn't want to continue the relationship because she set boundaries, he should have been honest but respectful. By ghosting, he's avoiding the conversation and leaving her confused.\n\nGhosting is widely seen as inconsiderate because it doesn't allow the other person to process the rejection. The user's actions might have hurt Casey, who showed interest and reached out. The fact that he mentions not wanting to spend more money is a bit self-centered and not a valid reason to ghost someone. Relationships shouldn't be based on transactional thinking.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer here is that the user is in the wrong. He should have communicated his feelings instead of ghosting. Therefore, the correct choice is A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
