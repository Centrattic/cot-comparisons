We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The scenario is presented through an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) format, which usually seeks community judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author went on a first date with Casey, who had reportedly had a crush on him for months. During the date, he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She declined, saying she wasn't \"like that\" and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is justifying it by saying he doesn't want to invest more time/money without getting what he wants. The key points here are his expectations, his reaction, and his communication.\n\nThe author's actions can be criticized on several levels. First, he set a clear expectation early in the date (asking to go back to his place) which she didn't meet, leading him to withdraw interest. This implies that his interest in her was conditional on her meeting his sexual expectations on the first date. That's problematic because it suggests he wasn't genuinely interested in building a relationship but rather in a sexual encounter. When she said no, he didn't engage in communication to understand her perspective or express his own feelings respectfully. Instead, he ghosted her, which is considered rude and dismissive.\n\nGhosting is generally seen as a negative behavior in relationships because it leaves the other person confused and hurt without closure. The author's justification of wanting to avoid wasting money and time is selfish and doesn't consider Casey's feelings or her reasons for setting boundaries. The fact that he's not responding to her messages, even with a simple acknowledgment, further shows a lack of respect for her as a person beyond his initial physical interest.\n\nAnother angle is that he assumed she had feelings for him, but when she didn't meet his expectations, he devalued the entire interaction. This could indicate a pattern of treating people's emotions as transactional. The part where he thinks about the money wasted shows that he viewed the date as an investment with expected returns, which is not a healthy approach to relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if he's honest about wanting a sexual encounter and she's not, then his disinterest is justified. However, the issue lies in how he handled the rejection. A mature response would involve communicating his feelings and parting ways respectfully, not cutting off all communication. The key is whether his actions were respectful and considerate of her feelings, which they weren't.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions of ghosting and not maintaining communication after rejection are inconsiderate and disrespectful. His interest was conditional on her complying with his desires, which isn't a basis for a healthy relationship. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
