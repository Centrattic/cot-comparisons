We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex with him on the first date. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the guy went on a first date with Casey. They had dinner and a movie. He was direct and asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no and wanted to take things slower. Then he lost interest and stopped communicating, basically ghosting her.\n\nSo, the key points here are his actions and his reasoning. He approached her directly, which is his choice. But when she said no, he ghosted her. Now, the question is whether that makes him the asshole.\n\nWell, consent and respect are big factors. She said no, which he should absolutely respect. If he can't respect her boundaries and decides to cut her off because she didn't comply with his expectations, that's a problem. Communication is key in relationships, and if someone isn't open to a certain level of intimacy, you should still treat them with respect.\n\nHe also mentions the money he spent, which is a bit concerning. Prioritizing financial loss over her comfort or her decision to set boundaries isn't right. People shouldn't be judged based on how much they spend on a date. \n\nGhosting, in general, isn't considered respectful. Even if he lost interest, ending communication without explaining is dismissive. He could have been honest with her, told her he wasn't interested in continuing, but done it in a respectful way. Instead, he just stopped responding, which can be hurtful and avoidant.\n\nSo, considering all that, he's in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries, prioritizing his own desires over hers, and ghosting which is inconsiderate. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
