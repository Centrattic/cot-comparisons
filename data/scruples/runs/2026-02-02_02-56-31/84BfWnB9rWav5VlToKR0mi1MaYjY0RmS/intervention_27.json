We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went on a first date with Casey, asked her directly if she wanted to go back to his place and \"fool around,\" but she said no. Then he lost interest and started ghosting her. He even mentions he's not responding beyond a thumbs up or \"k\" when she texts him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around dating and communication. The user approached the date with the primary goal of physical intimacy, which he thought was a given since she had a crush on him. But when she declined, he felt it was a personal failure and lost all interest, leading him to cut off communication. \n\nIs it wrong to ghost someone because they didn't meet your expectations? Well, in many cultures, people are expected to communicate openly and respect each other's boundaries. Ghosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person without closure. Casey might have been trying to let things develop more slowly, and the user's reaction of cutting off contact seems dismissive of her feelings and boundaries.\n\nAlso, the user's focus on the money spent on the date as a factor in his decision is a bit problematic. It sounds like he might have viewed the date more transactionally, which isn't healthy in a relationship. Respect for each other's decisions, even if they don't align with your own desires, is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is honest about his intentions and his loss of interest. He's not pretending to be interested when he isn't. However, ghosting isn't the best way to handle that. A better approach would be to have an open conversation, explain that his interests aren't aligned with hers, and part ways respectfully.\n\nSo putting it all together: the user's actions are hurtful and disrespectful in how he's ending the communication, but his intentions might be genuine. The key point is that ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not communicating properly and for not respecting her decision without cutting her off completely.\n"
