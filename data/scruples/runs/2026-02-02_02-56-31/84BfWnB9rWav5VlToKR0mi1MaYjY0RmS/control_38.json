We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who ghosted a girl after she refused to have sex on the first date. He admits he was looking for a casual hook-up but she wanted to take things slower. He felt ghosting her because she didn't \"put out\" was his right since he lost interest and felt it wasn't worth the money. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and ethical standards. Ghosting someone because they didn't have sex on the first date could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. The woman clearly communicated her boundaries and expressed that she wanted things to develop further. The man, however, decided to cut her off, which might be considered a breach of trust or respect for her boundaries.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect he mentions\u2014feeling like he wasted money\u2014shouldn't justify ghosting. Emotional and respectful communication is key in relationships, especially when there's a mismatch in expectations. The man's bluntness about his intentions might have set the stage, but he should have respected her response instead of withdrawing abruptly.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of consent and mutual respect. If he was upfront about his desires, she had the right to say no without facing repercussions. Ghosting her could be seen as holding her accountable for not meeting his expectations rather than accepting her no. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he's not obligated to continue the relationship if his needs aren't met. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting instead of an honest conversation\u2014could be problematic. He could have communicated his feelings more maturely, even if he chose to end things.\n\nIn terms of societal opinion, many people would consider it wrong to ghost someone for not meeting your expectations, especially when you've been clear about your intentions. It's important to treat people with respect regardless of personal disappointment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundaries and chose to ghost instead of handling the situation with more maturity and communication.\n"
