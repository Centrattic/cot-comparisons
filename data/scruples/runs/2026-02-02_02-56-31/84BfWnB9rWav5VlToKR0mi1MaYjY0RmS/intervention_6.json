We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nHe's been known Casey for 8 months, flirting for 2. She had a crush for 5-6 months. First date was movie, dinner. He asked directly if they could go back to his place to fool around. She said no, not tonight, and wanted to take it slower. He lost interest, stopped responding, and now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is ghosting because she didn't have sex with him on the first date. Let me think about the key points. He was honest about his intentions, which is good. But she was clear she wasn't comfortable with that yet. He then lost interest and stopped communicating. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person hanging without explanation. \n\nEven though he felt like he had a \"done deal,\" her saying no was a clear boundary. Respecting someone's boundaries is important. The fact that he's not responding now could hurt her feelings, especially since she's reaching out. He mentions he's not trying to hurt her, but his actions are still dismissive.\n\nAlso, his reasoning about the money spent on the date is a bit transactional. Relationships shouldn't be about expecting something in return. It's okay to have expectations, but when someone doesn't meet them, the right approach is to communicate rather than disappear.\n\nSo, considering all that, he's not in the wrong in terms of losing interest, but the way he handled it by ghosting without explanation makes him the asshole. People have different views on dating norms, but being honest about not wanting to continue is better than ghosting. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
