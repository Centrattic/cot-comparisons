We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went on a first date with Casey. He asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest, didn't respond to her texts, and basically ghosted her. He's justifying it by saying he spent money on the date and didn't want to go through another date where she might say no again.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author approached the date with the primary goal of physical intimacy, was straightforward about it, and when that didn't happen, he lost all interest and cut her off. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nFrom a social perspective, while it's his right to have certain expectations, the way he handled it is problematic. He was honest about his intentions, but then reacted negatively when hers didn't align. Respect in relationships usually involves understanding and respecting the other person's boundaries. By ghosting, he's not giving her the courtesy of a direct conversation, which is where he's wrong. Even if he's not interested anymore, a simple conversation explaining that would be better than cutting off all communication.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent instead of the mutual respect aspect shows a self-centered viewpoint. The value of a date shouldn't be measured in money but in mutual enjoyment and respect. His actions could be seen as dismissive and hurtful, regardless of his intentions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though he's being honest about his feelings, the way he's handling the situation is inconsiderate. He's in the wrong for ghosting without explanation and for prioritizing his own desires over her feelings and boundaries.\n"
