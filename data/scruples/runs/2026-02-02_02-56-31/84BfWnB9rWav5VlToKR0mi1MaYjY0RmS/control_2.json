We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Casey have been flirting for a couple of months, and there were rumors she had a crush on him. They went on a first date, which he describes as typical\u2014movie, dinner. He decided to be honest and asked her if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, that she's not like that, and wants to take things slow, implying maybe a second date. He then lost interest, stopped engaging during the date, and has since been ignoring her texts.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points here. The author's decision to ghost is based on the fact that she didn't reciprocate his immediate physical interest. He mentions he lost interest and doesn't want to invest more time or money. However, there are ethical considerations here.\n\nFirst, respect in relationships. Even if someone isn't interested in immediate physical intimacy, their decision is valid. Ghosting, which involves cutting off communication abruptly without explanation, is generally considered disrespectful and hurtful. The author's justification is that he lost interest, but that doesn't excuse leaving Casey in the dark about his feelings. If he's not interested in continuing the relationship because she set boundaries, he should communicate that respectfully rather than disappearing.\n\nSecond, the author's behavior during the date after her refusal. He zoned out and gave a limp hug, which shows a lack of respect for her decision. This indicates he wasn't really listening to her boundaries, which is problematic. His focus on money spent also suggests he viewed the date transactionally, which isn't healthy.\n\nThird, the fact that he's now ignoring her texts. Even if he's not interested in pursuing a relationship, responding politely to let her know his feelings would be the mature choice. Ghosting is a form of emotional manipulation and can leave the other person confused and hurt.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and ethical standards, people have the right to set their own boundaries for intimacy. The author's assumption that because she had a crush on him, she would agree to his terms is a misunderstanding of consent. Crushes don't equate to agreement to physical intimacy. His response was to withdraw interest entirely, which is valid in terms of his feelings, but the way he's handling it (ghosting) is where the problem lies.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he ghosted her instead of communicating his feelings, showed a lack of respect during the date by not engaging after her refusal, and focused on his own loss of interest and money rather than her perspective. The right approach would have been to have an honest conversation about his expectations and why he's not interested in continuing if he's not, rather than cutting her off.\n"
