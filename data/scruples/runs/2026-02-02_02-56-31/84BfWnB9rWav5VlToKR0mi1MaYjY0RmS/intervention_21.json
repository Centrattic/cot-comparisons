We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. They had a date, asked her directly if they could go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest and stopped communicating. \n\nFirst, the question is about whether this makes him the asshole. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nHmm. From what I know about relationships and social norms, people have different standards for when they want to become intimate. The user expected it to happen on the first date, but she was okay with waiting. That's her right. He then decided to ghost her because she didn't meet his expectations. \n\nIs it wrong to ghost someone for not meeting your sexual expectations? It seems like it. Even if it's his opinion, being upfront is important. He did say he's big on honesty, but then he didn't communicate his feelings clearly. Instead of just ghosting, maybe he should have told her that he wasn't interested in a slower pace and that he couldn't continue. \n\nGhosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. She reached out after, and he ignored her. That's not considerate. Also, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent on the date suggests he might have had ulterior motives, which isn't respectful. \n\nSo, he didn't respect her boundaries and didn't communicate his own feelings properly. That's a problem. So, I think he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
