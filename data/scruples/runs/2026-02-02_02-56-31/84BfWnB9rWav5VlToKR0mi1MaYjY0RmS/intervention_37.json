We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the user went on a date with Casey, who they knew liked them for months. He was direct about wanting to \"fool around\" but she said no, emphasizing she wasn't like that and wanted things to develop. The user then lost interest, stopped engaging during the date, and hasn't replied properly since, opting for minimal responses. He's considering himself in the right because he lost interest and doesn't want to invest more time or money without a guarantee.\n\nHmm, communication is key here. He was honest about his intentions, which is good, but when she declined, he didn't respect her boundaries. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if he's not interested anymore, cutting off communication abruptly is inconsiderate. Also, the reasoning about money and losing interest because she didn't comply with his initial request shows a transactional view of the interaction, which isn't respectful. People have the right to set boundaries, and respecting those is crucial in any relationship. So, the user's actions, while maybe understandable from his perspective, are dismissive of her feelings and boundaries. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
