We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The question is based on a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author asked Casey directly if they could \"fool around\" on the first date, which was after knowing each other for 8 months and flirting for 2. She said no, wanting to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding beyond minimal replies, and justified it by saying he doesn't want to spend more money without getting what he wants. The key points here are communication, respect, and expectations.\n\nThe author's actions involve being upfront but then not respecting her boundaries. By asking directly, he might have thought he had a chance, but when she declined, his response was to disengage rather than maintaining the relationship. Ghosting is generally considered rude, but the context matters. However, the author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations for physical intimacy. \n\nNow, considering the ethics: Is it wrong to ghost someone for not meeting your expectations? The author didn't explicitly state he wasn't interested in a relationship without sex, so maybe he should have been clearer earlier. However, he did ask and was rejected. On the other hand, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful. The fact that he's minimizing communication and not being honest about his feelings could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer often depends on cultural or personal values. In many perspectives, being honest about not wanting to continue is better than leading someone on. However, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014without a clear explanation might be seen as the asshole move because it leaves her confused and could be disrespectful. Also, his focus on the money spent could indicate a transactional view of the date, which isn't healthy.\n\nSo, the author's actions are selfish and disrespectful. He should have either communicated his needs upfront or been honest about his disappointment. Therefore, he's in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
