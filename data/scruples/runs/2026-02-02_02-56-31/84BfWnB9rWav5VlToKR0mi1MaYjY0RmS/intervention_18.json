We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: He and Casey have been flirting for two months, she's had a crush for 5-6 months. They had a first date, he asked if she wanted to go back to his place, she said no, and he lost interest. He hasn't responded to her texts beyond minimal responses. He's justifying this by saying he doesn't see the point of spending more money and time if she might say no again.\n\nHmm. Well, consent and respect are key here. He approached her and was honest, which is good. But when she said no, he ghosted her. That's where it gets iffy. People have the right to set boundaries, and she did. By not respecting her decision and cutting off communication, he might be in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nHe mentions he's not trying to hurt her, but his actions do. Even if he lost interest, a better approach would be to communicate that he's not interested in continuing the relationship. Ghosting is selfish because it avoids having a difficult conversation. Also, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent on the date is problematic. Relationships shouldn't be transactional like that. \n\nOn the other hand, he was upfront about his intentions. Maybe he thought she was on the same page, but she had different expectations. However, even if there was a misunderstanding, the proper thing is to address it. Ghosting doesn't solve anything and can hurt the other person. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A. He's in the wrong because he didn't handle the rejection maturely and chose to ghost instead of communicating his feelings. Respect for her decision and honesty would have been better.\n"
