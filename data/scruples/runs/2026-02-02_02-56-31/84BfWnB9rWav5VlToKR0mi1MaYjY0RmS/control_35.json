We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting his date after she refused to have sex on the first date. The key points here are communication, respect, and expectations.\n\nFirst, the author approached the date with the intention of having sex, as he bluntly asked her after the first date. When she said no, he interpreted that as a rejection and lost interest, leading him to ghost her. The problem here is that the author prioritized his desire for physical intimacy over her boundaries and the potential for a respectful relationship.\n\nIn healthy relationships, consent and mutual respect are crucial. The author's decision to cut off communication because she didn't meet his expectations shows a lack of respect for her autonomy and her right to set her own boundaries. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure or explanation. Even if the author felt disinterested, a more respectful approach would have been to have an honest conversation about his feelings without pressuring her.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions the cost of the date as a factor. This adds a transactional element, which can be problematic. Valuing a date based on financial input rather than mutual connection is a red flag. The fact that he's using the money spent as a reason to distance himself further indicates a lack of emotional investment and respect.\n\nOn the other hand, Casey respected the date by not giving in to pressure and chose to keep things platonic. Her attempts to reach out afterward show she was trying to maintain a connection. The author's response of ignoring her messages is dismissive and doesn't take into account her perspective or feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were disrespectful and inconsiderate. He didn't handle the rejection maturely and chose to end communication abruptly, which is why I'd say he's in the wrong.\n"
