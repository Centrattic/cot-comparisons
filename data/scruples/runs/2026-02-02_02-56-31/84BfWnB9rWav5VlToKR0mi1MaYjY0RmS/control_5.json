We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went on a first date, and the guy asked if they could go back to his place to have sex. The girl said no, and the guy then lost interest and stopped talking to her. He's asking if he's the asshole for ghosting her because she didn't give him sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. Ghosting someone generally means cutting off all communication without explanation, which is often seen as inconsiderate. But the guy's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted. However, expecting physical intimacy on the first date might not be reasonable. The girl said she wanted to take things slower, so maybe the guy misread the signals or had unrealistic expectations. \n\nThe guy also mentions the cost of the date and feeling like he wasted money. That's a bit shallow, maybe, because dating should be about mutual interest and respect, not just transactional. His reaction to her refusal seems to prioritize his own desires over her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy is being honest about his intentions. If he's only interested in a relationship that includes physical intimacy, and she's not interested in that yet, then maybe their expectations are mismatched. However, it's still rude to ghost her without a clear explanation. He should have communicated his feelings instead of disappearing. \n\nSo, even though the guy's actions stem from his own expectations not being met, the act of ghosting is generally considered disrespectful. He could have had an honest conversation to explain why he was disinterested instead of cutting her off. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for ghosting without explanation and for not respecting her boundaries.\n"
