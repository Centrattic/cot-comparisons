We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. First, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author went on a date with Casey, who had a crush on him for months. He asked her to go back to his place, but she said no, and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and ghosted her. He mentions he's not trying to hurt her, just that he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off communication without explanation. But the author's reasoning is that he wanted a physical relationship and wasn't interested in continuing if that wasn't going to happen. However, expecting someone to have sex on the first date is a big assumption. Casey was clear she wanted to take it slow, so maybe the author was too forward.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling like he wasted money, which might indicate he viewed the date more transactionally. That's not a good basis for a relationship. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding. By ghosting, he's avoiding communication, which isn't the best approach even if he's disappointed.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different boundaries and expectations. If the author was upfront about needing physical intimacy and she wasn't ready, maybe it's a mismatch. But the problem is in how he handled it. Ghosting is poor communication regardless of the reason. He should have been honest about his feelings instead of cutting her off.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he ghosted her without explanation, didn't respect her boundaries properly by expecting sex on the first date, and treated the interaction more as a transaction. Even if his expectations weren't met, the right approach would be to communicate that respectfully.\n"
