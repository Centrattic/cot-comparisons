We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. So, the main points here are the context of their relationship, what happened on the date, and the user's reaction.\n\nFirst, they had a first date, which went well. The user asked directly if they could go back to his place and have sex, but she said no. The user felt that since she had a crush on him for months, he thought it was a \"done deal.\" When she declined, he zoned out, didn't respond well, and later ghosted her. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole for doing that.\n\nSo, the key factors here are consent, respect, and communication. The user approached her directly about sex, which is a personal boundary she set. She said no, and he respected that initially but then lost interest because his goal wasn't met. Ghosting someone because they didn't comply with your expectations is generally considered disrespectful. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and understanding, not just physical expectations.\n\nAlso, the user's focus on the money spent on the date might be a contributing factor to his frustration. However, that's not a valid reason to cut off someone. If someone isn't interested in moving forward in the way you want, it's important to handle it gracefully, even if it's disappointing. Ghosting can be hurtful and is often seen as a lack of consideration for the other person's feelings.\n\nEven though the user claims he's not trying to hurt her, the act of ghosting still leaves her in the dark. A better approach would have been to communicate his feelings, even if he decided not to pursue a relationship. This would show maturity and respect, regardless of his personal disappointment.\n\nSo, based on these points, the user's actions are more about his own unmet expectations rather than respecting her boundaries. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
