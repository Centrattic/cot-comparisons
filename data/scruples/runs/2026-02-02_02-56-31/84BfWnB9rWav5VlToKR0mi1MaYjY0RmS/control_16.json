We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a girl named Casey after she wouldn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author had known Casey for 8 months, had been flirting for 2, and there were rumors she had a crush on him for 5-6 months. They went on a first date, and he asked her to go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, didn't respond to her texts, and now is ghosting her. He justifies it by saying he's not interested anymore because she didn't sleep with him, he spent money on the date, and he doesn't want to risk another date without getting what he wanted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author lost interest, cutting off communication completely without explanation can be hurtful. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's expectation that she would be sexual on the first date, his immediate loss of interest when she didn't, and the decision to ghost instead of having an open conversation. The author's reasoning is that he's not interested anymore, but his approach is dismissive and lacks respect for her boundaries. \n\nCasey set a boundary by declining his request, which is her right. The author's reaction of ghosting doesn't give her a chance to understand why he's pulling away. Even if he's honest, at least providing a reason would be more respectful. The fact that he's using the excuse of lost money and time also shows a transactional view of the relationship, which isn't healthy. \n\nIn many cultures, it's considered important to communicate one's feelings and decisions, even if you're ending things. Ghosting is often seen as cowardly and disrespectful, regardless of the reason. The author's decision to stop responding to her texts and avoid further interaction, without a conversation, makes him the asshole here. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's being inconsiderate by ghosting and not respecting her decision to take things slow.\n"
