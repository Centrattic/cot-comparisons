I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is their sleep habits conflicting.\n\nFirst, the user is a light sleeper and needs a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. The user says they've been dealing with this for years, and it's affecting their sleep. They tried compromising, but it's not working. They finally snapped and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's not the point of being a couple if they can't share a bed.\n\nHmm. Relationships often require compromise. The user is clearly frustrated, but maybe they should have addressed the issue earlier? They mention they've been together 8 years, so this isn't a new problem. Maybe there were previous attempts to solve it that didn't work. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the problem\u2014snores and TV. The user is trying to find a solution for their well-being. However, moving to separate rooms is a big step. Maybe there were other alternatives they could explore first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or addressing the TV issue. The fianc\u00e9 might feel rejected or like the user is giving up. \n\nBut the user's health is important too. Chronic sleep deprivation can be serious. If all else fails, separate rooms might be necessary. The fianc\u00e9's response seems a bit extreme, implying that the relationship's validity is tied to sharing a bed. That's not a healthy viewpoint. The user isn't wrong for seeking a solution that helps them. They've tried compromising, but it's not working. So, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate need. However, the approach of suddenly saying they're sleeping separately might have been abrupt. Perhaps a more gradual approach or discussing alternatives first would have been better. But given the situation, the user's action is understandable. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
