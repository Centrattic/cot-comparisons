I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper and the other guy is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV. The user is frustrated after 8 years of this. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it's a bad idea because they'd just be roommates.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The key points are the sleep issues, the duration of the relationship, and the fianc\u00e9's reaction. The user wants peace at night, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing problems, and the user is looking for a solution. \n\nSeparate rooms might seem drastic, but if they're engaged with two kids, maybe they need to find a compromise. But the user has tried to ask him to lower the TV volume, which he does minimally, but then complains if it's turned down. The user's health and well-being are important too. \n\nIs the user at fault? Well, suggesting a separate room is a solution to a real problem. But maybe there are other options they haven't tried yet, like a white noise machine, earplugs, or a different sleeping arrangement within the same house. However, if those haven't worked, then separate rooms could be a valid choice. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is about commitment, but the user argues that being a couple doesn't have to mean sharing a bedroom every night. It's about their personal needs versus the relationship's dynamics. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. They've endured this for a long time and are prioritizing their health. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more considerate too, but the user's action is a reasonable response to a persistent issue. So answer B.\n"
