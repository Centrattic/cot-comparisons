I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about suggesting to sleep in separate rooms because of differing sleep habits.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is a light sleeper who can't handle noise, while her fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on loud. They've been together 8 years with two kids. The fianc\u00e9's TV habits are causing her sleep issues. She's tried compromising, like him lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. She's exhausted and finally snapped, suggesting separate rooms.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the impact on her well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues, so her need for rest is valid. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting her significantly, and she's tried to find a solution. The fianc\u00e9's response about being roommates seems dismissive of her needs.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. She did talk to him and suggest a compromise before resorting to separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might indicate a lack of understanding of her health needs. Sleeping separately isn't uncommon in some relationships where sleep issues persist despite other efforts. So, her decision to prioritize her health isn't inherently wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about the change rather than the validity of her needs.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No). The author isn't wrong for seeking a solution that improves her quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause here, and she's making a reasonable request. However, it's important for them to communicate further to find a middle ground, but in terms of right or wrong, she's justified.\n"
