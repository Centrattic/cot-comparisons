I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and insists on having the TV on at a loud volume. The user is a light sleeper and can't handle all the noise. They've been together 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's against the point of being a couple, but the user just wants to sleep well.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep problems can affect health and well-being. But the fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this issue. However, the fianc\u00e9's response is defensive, questioning the relationship's purpose. The user has tried compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. They've been dealing with this for a long time, so maybe the fianc\u00e9 hasn't made sufficient effort to adjust.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make accommodations. The user is asking for something reasonable, but the fianc\u00e9 is not willing to change, which could indicate a problem. The fact that he can't hear the TV when it's turned down (even in his sleep) suggests he's resistant to any compromise. The user's frustration is justified given the years of poor sleep. So, the answer would likely be B, the user isn't in the wrong. They're trying to solve a problem that's affecting their health, which is a critical need.\n"
