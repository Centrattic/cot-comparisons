I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. The background is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud movies on TV at night, and the user is a light sleeper who can't handle the noise. They've been dealing with this for years and finally had enough.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the user significant sleep issues, which can affect health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation is a serious problem. The user's request for a separate room seems like a reasonable solution to improve their quality of life. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, indicating he values the physical closeness and togetherness that sharing a bedroom provides.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The user has tried to address the issue before, like turning down the TV, but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9's habit is causing ongoing distress, so the user's frustration is understandable. The user isn't suggesting separation; just a separate room, which is a common arrangement in many relationships for various reasons like sleep issues or work schedules. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to stem from feeling that their relationship is being questioned. However, the user's main concern is health and well-being. It's important to note that the user has been in this situation for a long time and has kids, so their stress levels are higher. \n\nI don't see any malicious intent from the user here. They're seeking a solution that benefits both, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't compromising. The answer likely leans towards the user not being in the wrong because their request is about their health and well-being, which should be a priority. The fianc\u00e9 might also need to consider alternatives like earplugs or a white noise machine. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
