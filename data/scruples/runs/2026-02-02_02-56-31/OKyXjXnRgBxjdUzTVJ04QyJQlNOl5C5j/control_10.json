I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snorts a lot and watches loud movies on TV while sleeping. The fianc\u00e9 has to keep the TV on, which disturbs the author. The author is frustrated and has asked to sleep in separate rooms, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it, saying they might as well be roommates. The author wants a good night's sleep after dealing with this for years.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's need for a quiet environment to sleep and the fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust. The author's main argument is about their health and well-being, as consistent poor sleep can lead to serious health issues. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about the relationship dynamics, implying that separate rooms are for roommates, not couples.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship advice, many sources suggest that couples should make efforts to accommodate each other's needs unless there's a medical issue. However, in this case, the author is making a reasonable request for their own well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are significantly impacting the author's health. While it's true that couples often share a bedroom, the health impact here might justify separate rooms. \n\nBut then again, the author is using the \"ITA\" framework, which is about whether they're in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 is also not without fault here\u2014his sleeping habits are problematic. The author might be justified in seeking a solution, especially with the added stress of having two kids. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive of the author's needs, which could indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nHowever, the author's solution is to sleep in separate rooms, which might be seen as a last resort. They could have tried other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or addressing the TV issue. But given that they've tried compromising (lowering the volume a bit) and it's not working, separate rooms might be necessary. \n\nIn terms of relationship advice, some experts might say that if one partner's health is suffering due to the other's habits, it's reasonable to seek a solution that prioritizes health. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's just like roommates is a bit dismissive of the author's legitimate needs. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their request is about their health and well-being, which should be a priority. The fianc\u00e9's habits are contributing to the problem, so the author is justified in seeking a solution. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
