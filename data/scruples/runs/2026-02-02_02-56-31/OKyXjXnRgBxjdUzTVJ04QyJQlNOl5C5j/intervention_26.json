I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loudly at night, which disrupts their sleep. The user is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for years.\n\nFirst, the key points: The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant sleep issues. The user has communicated this over time but it's not resolved. They're engaged, have kids, and this has been going on for a long time. The fianc\u00e9 reacts negatively, equating separate rooms to just being roommates.\n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is key. The user has tried compromises (like lowering the volume a bit), but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9 isn't acknowledging the impact of his actions. Sleep deprivation can affect health and well-being, so the user's request is reasonable. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests he might not see it as a valid concern, which could indicate a deeper issue in how problems are addressed in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's situational. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting to address their need for rest, especially when health is involved. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to accommodate without understanding the severity might be the issue here. But relationships require mutual compromise. The user's approach might be seen as a necessary step to protect their health, not a rejection of the relationship. So the answer is B.\n"
