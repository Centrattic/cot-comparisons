I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms due to their partner's loud snoring and TV habits. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who plays loud TV shows while sleeping. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't notice the volume and can't hear if the TV is turned down. The author has tried compromising but is finally fed up and wants separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's not right for a couple to sleep apart.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The fianc\u00e9's habits are really disruptive\u2014loud TV and snoring. The author tried to compromise before, but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is about the idea of being roommates versus a couple.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's about whose needs are valid. The author's need for rest is important. Sleep is crucial for health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing harm, and the author is trying to resolve it by sleeping separately. The fianc\u00e9's argument seems to be based on a traditional view of marriage where couples share a bed, but that shouldn't override the health and well-being of one partner. There are alternatives like white noise machines, CPAP devices for snoring, or earplugs, but if those aren't effective, separate rooms might be necessary.\n\nThe author's action is a solution to a long-standing problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the principle rather than the solution. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health. The answer is probably B (No). But I should check if there are other angles. Maybe the author should have tried more solutions first? But they said they tried lowering the volume a bit. Maybe they didn't explore all options, but given the time, it's reasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
