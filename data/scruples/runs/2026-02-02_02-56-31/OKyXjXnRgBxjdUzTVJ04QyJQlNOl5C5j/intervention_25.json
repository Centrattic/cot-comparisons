I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the user is a light sleeper, needs quiet, while their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches action movies with the TV on. They've been dealing with this for a long time, 8 years together, engaged for a year, two kids. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to compromise enough, even though he sometimes lowers the volume a little. The user finally had enough and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship if they can't share a bed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider if the user's request is reasonable. Sleep is important for health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The user has tried to communicate this over many years. The fianc\u00e9's response is to argue that sharing a bed is essential for their relationship. But maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The fianc\u00e9 might not realize the impact of his actions on the user's health. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could try earplugs, white noise machines, or a different TV setup. But the user tried and it's not working. If the fianc\u00e9 is so set against separate rooms, maybe there's a deeper issue. However, the user's need for rest is valid. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to compromise. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to make changes that significantly affect the user's well-being, then the user isn't wrong for seeking a solution. Sleeping separately isn't necessarily a bad thing for a relationship; some couples do it for various reasons. \n\nSo, considering the long-term stress and health effects of poor sleep, the user's request is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might indicate he hasn't considered the negative impact of his habits. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
