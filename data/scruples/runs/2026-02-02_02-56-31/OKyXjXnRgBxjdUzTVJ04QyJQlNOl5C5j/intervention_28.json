I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. They mention they're a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loud at night. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to compromise enough, and the user is tired of bad sleep. They've been together a long time with kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's need for rest is important. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and the user has tried to compromise by lowering the volume a bit. But the problem persists. The user's suggestion to sleep separately is a way to address their own needs, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping separately would make them just roommates. But the user is in a committed relationship with kids, so their needs shouldn't be ignored. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting the user's health and quality of life. It's about finding a balance, but when one person's needs are consistently unmet, it's reasonable to seek a solution, even if it's separate rooms.\n\nAlso, the user has been dealing with this for years. It's not a new issue. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about the change rather than understanding the user's long-term struggle. So, the user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health. Sleeping separately is a common solution in many relationships when there are incompatible sleep habits. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
