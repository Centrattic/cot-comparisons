I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9 has a TV on loud while sleeping, which is causing them a lot of sleep issues. The user is a light sleeper, and this has been going on for years with kids involved.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the dynamics here. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and uses the TV as a sleep aid. The user has tried compromising, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The user's health and well-being are affected by lack of sleep, which is a valid concern. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues, so it's not just about being a bother\u2014it's a serious issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the user is overreacting or not making enough effort to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9's need for the TV noise might be a coping mechanism or something they're not aware is problematic. The user's suggestion to sleep separately might be seen as a breakdown in communication or a lack of compromise. However, given the duration of the issue (8 years together) and the impact on the user's quality of life, it's reasonable to seek a solution that prioritizes their health.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument about the purpose of being in a relationship versus being roommates is a common one. But relationships do require mutual respect and accommodation. If one partner's habits are significantly affecting the other's well-being, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The user isn't rejecting the relationship but seeking a practical solution to a specific problem.\n\nPossible alternatives they haven't tried yet: maybe using white noise machines, earplugs, or soundproofing. But the user might have already tried those or found them ineffective. The key point is that the user's need for restful sleep is legitimate and shouldn't be dismissed as being in the wrong. So the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), as they're advocating for their health after years of struggle.\n"
