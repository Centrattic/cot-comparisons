I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows while sleeping. The fianc\u00e9's TV volume is too loud for the author, leading to poor sleep. The author is frustrated and has decided to sleep separately, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset about it, thinking it's the end of their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The fianc\u00e9's behavior seems to be a long-standing issue that hasn't been resolved through communication. The author's request for separate rooms is to get better sleep, which is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that sleeping apart would make them just roommates, but the author is prioritizing their well-being.\n\nI should think about whether there are other solutions that could have been tried before separate rooms. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume by 3 points, but it's still too loud. Maybe there are other compromises, like using earplugs or a white noise machine. But the author might have already tried those. The fianc\u00e9's habit of watching loud TV at night is affecting the author's health, which is a valid concern. The author's decision to sleep apart is a solution to a problem caused by the other person's habits. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about the relationship than the issue itself, which could indicate a problem in how he's handling the situation.\n\nAlso, considering the engagement and the two kids, the author is probably thinking about the long-term stability and their family's well-being. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to make changes and the author's health is suffering, then the author's decision is understandable. The question is if the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they should be roommates if they can't share a bed is a bit extreme. The author is addressing a personal need, which is reasonable. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They are seeking a solution to a problem that's been ongoing and affecting their quality of life.\n"
