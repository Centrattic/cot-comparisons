I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The user is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV loudly at night. Despite some compromises, the noise from the TV with explosions and such is causing the user to have bad sleep. They've been dealing with this for a long time (8 years together, engaged for 1 year, two kids). The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's bad for the relationship to not share a room.\n\nSo, the main points here are about sleep quality vs. relationship dynamics. The user is trying to find a solution to their chronic sleep issues. Sleeping separately is a common solution some couples use when they have incompatible sleep habits. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that not sharing a bed might make them feel like roommates, which is a valid concern about intimacy and relationship health.\n\nBut the user's health and well-being are also important. Chronic lack of good sleep can lead to physical and mental health issues. The user's request is for their own well-being. It's not about rejecting the relationship but seeking a practical solution.\n\nI need to consider if the user is overstepping or if this is a reasonable request. Since both partners have different needs, finding a middle ground might be ideal. However, the user has tried compromises (like lowering the volume a bit), but it's not sufficient. So suggesting separate rooms is a step they're taking to prioritize their health. It's not necessarily wrong to do that. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is understandable, but the user isn't at fault for wanting to improve their quality of life. The answer would depend on whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the user's need for sleep is legitimate and they've tried other solutions, B (Not in the wrong) makes sense.\n"
