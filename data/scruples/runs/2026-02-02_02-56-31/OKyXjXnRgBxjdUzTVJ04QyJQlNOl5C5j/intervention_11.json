I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe main points are about differing sleep needs. The fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper needing quiet, while the other partner is a heavy sleeper who needs TV on at a loud volume. This has been going on for years, leading to the fianc\u00e9's frustration and decision to sleep separately. The fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's need for good sleep is valid; chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. On the other hand, the partner's habits are established and might be part of their relaxation routine. The fianc\u00e9's request isn't about separation but about personal health. The response from the partner seems to be about the symbolism of sharing a bed, which is a common point in relationships.\n\nNow, societal norms often view sleeping in separate rooms as a sign of relationship problems, but this is changing. Some couples choose separate beds for comfort without it meaning the end of their relationship. The key here is communication and compromise. The fianc\u00e9 tried to address the issue, and when it didn't work, suggested a separate room. The partner's reaction is more about the principle of togetherness, but the core issue is about meeting each other's needs.\n\nI should check if there's a middle ground. For example, could the partner use earplugs or a white noise machine? Could the TV volume be adjusted further, or use a different sound source instead of an action movie? However, the user mentioned that the partner has tried lowering the volume a bit but it's still problematic. The fianc\u00e9's health and well-being are important, so insisting on their needs isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe duration of the relationship (8 years together, 1 year engaged) suggests that this isn't a new issue. The fianc\u00e9 has been enduring this for a long time, leading to the breaking point. The partner's argument about being roommates might be a knee-jerk reaction not considering the fianc\u00e9's needs. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect and finding solutions. The fianc\u00e9 isn't wrong for prioritizing their health. The partner might need to adjust their habits more, but if that's impossible, separate rooms could be a reasonable solution. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
