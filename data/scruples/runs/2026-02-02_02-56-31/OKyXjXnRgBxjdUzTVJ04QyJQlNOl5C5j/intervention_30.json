I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue here is the differing sleep habits. The user is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment, while their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and likes the TV on. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the user to have poor sleep every night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They've been dealing with this for eight years, engaged for one, and have two kids. Chronic lack of sleep can lead to health issues, so seeking a solution is understandable. The user's request is a reasonable attempt to improve their quality of life and health, which is important for maintaining their role as a partner and parent.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is based on the idea that sleeping in separate rooms undermines their relationship, as he equates sharing a bed to being a couple. However, relationships can involve compromises, especially when one partner's habits significantly impact the other's well-being. The fianc\u00e9's behavior, such as not respecting the compromise of lowering the TV volume and continuing to watch loud movies, shows a lack of adjustment on his part.\n\nThe user's decision to set a boundary is a valid step to address their needs. It's a matter of prioritizing health and well-being, which is a common reason couples might sleep in separate rooms. There's no indication that the user is trying to avoid the relationship but rather to find a practical solution to a long-standing problem.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong. They're seeking a compromise that benefits both their health and the relationship's stability in the long run. The fianc\u00e9 might need to adjust his habits further if they want to continue sharing a room. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
