I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows at night and snores loudly. The author has been dealing with this for a long time and is now suggesting separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is their inability to sleep well due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. They've tried some compromises, like lowering the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately would mean they're just roommates, which is a common counterargument in such situations. The author is frustrated and wants better sleep for their health and well-being.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the question is whether the author is being unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's habits are clearly disruptive. While sleeping in separate rooms might seem drastic, it's a solution they've tried after enduring years of poor sleep. The author has children, so their well-being affects the whole family. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive of the author's needs, suggesting he hasn't considered the impact of his actions. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should make compromises. However, when one partner's needs are causing significant harm to the other's health (like chronic sleep deprivation), it's reasonable to seek a solution. The author isn't asking to end the relationship but to improve their quality of life. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a practical solution. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the symbolic meaning of sharing a bed rather than addressing the actual problem. So the answer is B.\n"
