I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. Despite some compromise, like lowering the volume a bit, the noise problem persists. The user tried to address it but ended up feeling frustrated, leading to the suggestion of separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is against this, arguing it would make them just roommates.\n\nNow, considering the key factors here. The user's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem, and while he's made minor adjustments, they might not be enough. The user has tried to address it but to no avail. The relationship is long-term with kids involved, so the stress from lack of sleep can impact the whole family.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 sees the solution as extreme, possibly affecting their relationship. But the user's request isn't about ending the relationship but about personal health. Sleeping separately isn't unheard of in relationships, especially when there are valid reasons like health. The user isn't trying to push the fianc\u00e9 away but to find a way to coexist comfortably.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong here. They have a legitimate need that's not being met despite their efforts. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might be due to not fully understanding the impact of noise on the user's sleep. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
