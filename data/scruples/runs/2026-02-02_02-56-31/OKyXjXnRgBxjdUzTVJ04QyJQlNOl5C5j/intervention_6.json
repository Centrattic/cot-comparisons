  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for suggesting to my fiance that we sleep in separate rooms?\nHere's the background. I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to sleep in separate rooms from their fianc\u00e9. The background is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, plays loud TV, and the user is a light sleeper. They've been dealing with this for years and now the user suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's main issue is lack of sleep because of the fianc\u00e9's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can really affect health and well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might not realize how disruptive his actions are. The user has tried compromising, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response is that separate rooms would make them just roommates. That's a common argument, but the user's health and happiness are important too. They've been together a long time, so maybe communication has been an issue. Has the user talked about how the TV and snoring affect them? Maybe the fianc\u00e9 is used to sleeping with noise and doesn't see it as a problem.\n\nAlso, the user mentions their kids. Maybe the kids sleep in separate rooms, but the parents are struggling. The user might be trying to set a good example or just need their own space. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe trying earplugs, white noise machines, or a sleep apnea test for snoring? But if all else fails, separate rooms might be necessary. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could be resistance to change, but the user's need for sleep is valid.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the user isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a long-term issue affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9 might need to adjust, but if it's not possible, separate rooms are a reasonable solution. Answer B.\n"
