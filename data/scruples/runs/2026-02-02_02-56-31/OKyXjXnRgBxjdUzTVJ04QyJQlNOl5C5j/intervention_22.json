I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The background is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, has loud TV on at night, and the user is a light sleeper. They've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it's bad because then they're just roommates.\n\nHmm. So, the user's main issue is sleep deprivation due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. They tried to compromise by turning down the volume a bit, but the fianc\u00e9 can't hear it when he's asleep. The user is frustrated and wants to sleep in another room. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, thinking it's bad for the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's right to a good night's sleep is important. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing that. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sharing a bed is part of the relationship. But they've been together a long time, so maybe they should have found a solution by now.\n\nThe user's request is for their own health. If they can't sleep, it's a valid concern. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 isn't being considerate enough. But maybe there are other solutions before separate rooms, like a white noise machine, earplugs, or a different sleep environment. But the user says they tried some compromises, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that if they don't share a bed, they're just roommates. But roommates can have separate rooms too. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 is using that as a way to avoid changing his habits. The user has been dealing with this for years, so it's a long-term issue. It's not just a sudden request but something they've endured for a long time.\n\nSo, the user is trying to prioritize their health and well-being. They're not necessarily at fault for wanting to sleep in a separate room to get rest. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about his own discomfort with change or not wanting to adjust his habits. The user's point is valid because their health is important. The answer might be B, No, they're not in the wrong.\n"
