I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves differing sleep habits between the author and their fianc\u00e9. The author is a light sleeper and gets disturbed by the fianc\u00e9's loud snoring and the TV, which he insists stays on. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and doesn't notice the noise. The author has had enough and wants to sleep separately, but the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a relationship problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their need for a quiet environment to sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health, so this is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has his own sleep habits that he's not able to change easily. He might not realize how disruptive his snoring and the TV are. The fact that he can't hear it when the author turns it down suggests he's used to a certain noise level, but that doesn't mean the author should suffer.\n\nThe engagement and kids add another layer. This isn't a short-term relationship issue; it's been going on for 8 years with a child. The author has tried compromising, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's argument about sharing a bed being a part of being a couple might be more about tradition or discomfort with change rather than the actual problem. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's solution is reasonable. Separate rooms can be a practical solution for incompatible sleep needs. Many couples do this for various reasons, especially when one partner's habits significantly affect the other's health. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could be missing the point; the issue isn't about sharing a room but about the author's well-being. \n\nHowever, maybe there are other solutions they haven't tried. For example, using earplugs, a white noise machine, or a different type of TV sound. But the author has already tried some compromises. If those didn't work, separate rooms might be the best option. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're addressing a long-standing problem that's affecting their quality of life. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate need, and the fianc\u00e9's resistance might be due to not understanding the severity of the issue or not wanting to change his habits. The answer should be B (No).\n"
