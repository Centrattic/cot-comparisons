I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a light sleeper, needs quiet to sleep. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 even says he can't hear the TV in his sleep if it's turned down. The author is exhausted from years of bad sleep and wants to sleep in a separate room. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, saying if they can't share a bed, why be a couple instead of roommates.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's request is about their health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem. The author has tried to compromise (like lowering the volume a bit) but it's not enough. They've been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that separate rooms would make their relationship feel like roommates. But the author's need for rest is significant. The fianc\u00e9's TV habit is a major disruption. The author's action is to improve their quality of life, which is understandable.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe using earplugs, white noise machines, or different sleeping arrangements. But the author has tried some compromises already. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not realizing the severity of the problem or not wanting to change his habits. However, the author's health is important. Long-term sleep issues can't be ignored. The author isn't asking to end the relationship, just to have separate rooms for better sleep. That's a reasonable request. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates is a bit extreme, as couples can have separate rooms for various reasons without it affecting their relationship status. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
