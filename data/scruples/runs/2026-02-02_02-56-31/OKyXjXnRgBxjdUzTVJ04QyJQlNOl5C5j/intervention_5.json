I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's loud snoring and the TV at night, which the user can't handle because they're a light sleeper.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, can't hear the TV if it's too low, and plays action movies with loud sounds. The user is exhausted and wants to sleep better. They tried to talk about it, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't compromising enough. The user's breaking point leads them to suggest separate rooms.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's bad for their relationship. But the user's health and well-being are at stake here. Chronic sleep issues can lead to health problems, so this isn't just about personal preference. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting the user's quality of life.\n\nThe user's actions are a last resort after years of struggle. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to not take into account the user's needs. The user isn't trying to push the fianc\u00e9 away but to find a solution for both. Sleeping separately is a common solution when couples have incompatible sleep needs. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about feeling criticized than the actual issue. The user's perspective is valid here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
