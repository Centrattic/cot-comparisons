I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9's heavy snoring, preference for TV noise, and the author's need for quiet to sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a light sleeper, which is a legitimate issue. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014snoring loudly and needing the TV on\u2014are causing significant disruption. The author has tried compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. After eight years together, the author is at their breaking point, leading to the suggestion of separate rooms.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 views the separate room idea as a problem, arguing that not sharing a bed undermines the relationship. There's a concern here about the emotional aspect of their marriage, as they're engaged with two kids. The fianc\u00e9's habits might be a long-standing issue that the author has been tolerating, which could affect their well-being and the relationship's health.\n\nI should evaluate whether the author's action is reasonable. Sleep is essential for health, and chronic sleep deprivation can have serious consequences. The author has made compromises but is now seeking a solution that addresses their fundamental need. The fianc\u00e9's habits are non-negotiable for him, so the author's frustration is valid. However, moving to separate rooms might feel like a major step, so the fianc\u00e9's reaction is also understandable from his perspective.\n\nPossible alternatives could include using earplugs, white noise machines, or seeking medical advice for the snoring. But if those haven't been tried or are ineffective, then separate rooms might be the only viable solution. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the author has tried some compromises and the issue is causing significant distress, it's likely they're not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not wanting to change his habits or feeling that separate rooms are a step back from their commitment.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are prioritizing their health and well-being in a long-term relationship where their needs haven't been met despite efforts to compromise.\n"
