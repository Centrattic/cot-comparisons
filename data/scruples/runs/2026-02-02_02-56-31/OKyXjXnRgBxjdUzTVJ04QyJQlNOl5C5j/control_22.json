I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a long-term engagement with two kids, and the main issue is sleep disturbances caused by the fianc\u00e9's snoring and TV habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a light sleeper, and their partner is a heavy snorer who watches TV loudly. The author has tried to compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's still causing consistent sleep problems. The author is exhausted and has had enough, so they suggest separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, thinking it's not good for their relationship.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is understanding the impact of sleep deprivation. Chronic lack of sleep can lead to health issues, mood swings, and stress, which can affect the entire family. The author's request for a separate room seems like a reasonable solution to address their basic need for rest. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel rejected or think the author is overreacting. However, the author has been putting up with this for years, which is a long time to endure such issues without resolution.\n\nIt's also important to note that the couple has two kids, so the author's well-being is crucial not just for themselves but for the whole family. Suggesting a practical solution like separate rooms isn't about ending the relationship but about improving quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from not realizing how severe the problem is or feeling defensive about his habits.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key, but both partners need to prioritize each other's health and happiness. The author isn't wrong for seeking a solution that benefits their mental and physical health. The fianc\u00e9's resistance could be due to not seeing the issue the same way, but that doesn't make the author's request invalid. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
