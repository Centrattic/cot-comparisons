I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 has a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows in bed and snores a lot, making the author sleep poorly. They've been together 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately is bad for their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is justified in wanting a good night's sleep after years of this. Their sleep is affected every night, which can lead to health issues. The fianc\u00e9's habits are pretty extreme\u2014sleeping through a rock concert, TV at half volume, which is probably way too loud for the author. The author tried to communicate and compromise, but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates is a bit extreme, maybe not considering the author's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried more solutions before suggesting separate rooms, like earplugs or using white noise machines. But given that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, even if the author turned down the TV, he wakes up in sleep and says he can't hear it. So maybe it's not just about the volume he sets, but his ability to hear it even when it's lowered. That complicates things. \n\nThe author's request isn't about wanting to avoid the partner but about needing rest. Since they have kids, rest is important for taking care of them. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be about the symbolism of sleeping together, but practicality should take precedence. The author's health and the long-term relationship might be better served by sleeping separately if that's the only solution. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried to communicate and it's not working, so their well-being is important.\n"
