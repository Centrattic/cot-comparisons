I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. They're a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately would make them just roommates. The user has been dealing with this for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic poor sleep can affect health and relationships. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive, and the user is trying to find a solution. But the fianc\u00e9 feels that separate rooms would undermine their relationship.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The user tried to communicate their needs but the fianc\u00e9 isn't fully cooperating. However, suggesting separate rooms might be a last resort after years of issues. The user isn't being inconsiderate; they're addressing a long-standing problem that affects their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's just about being roommates is a bit extreme, as couples can sleep separately for various reasons and still have a strong relationship.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and happiness, which is important. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more accommodating, but the user's request is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
