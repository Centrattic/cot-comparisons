I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 has a TV on at a loud volume, watches action movies with lots of noise, and snores loudly, which is making the user a sleep-deprived light sleeper.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The user has tried to find a compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The user is at their breaking point after 8 years together with two kids. They need a good night's sleep for their health and well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, which is a valid emotional concern. But the user's request is about basic comfort and health. Sleeping in separate rooms isn't about rejecting the relationship but about finding a solution that works for both. The fianc\u00e9 might need to adjust his habits or find alternative ways to sleep, like using earplugs or a white noise machine. The user isn't wrong for prioritizing their health, especially given the long-term strain this situation has caused. So the answer is B.\n"
