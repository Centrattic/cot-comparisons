I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms. The context is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and watches loud TV, causing noise. The author is a light sleeper and can't sleep well. They've been together a long time with kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are problematic. He's aware of the issue but only slightly compromises. The author tried to communicate but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive, comparing it to roommates. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing harm, and the author is seeking a reasonable solution. The author has tried adjusting the volume, but it's not sufficient. After 8 years, the author's frustration is justified. The fianc\u00e9's argument doesn't address the core issue of the author's health. So, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution to a legitimate problem.\n"
