I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for suggesting separate rooms due to their fianc\u00e9's sleeping habits. The main issues here are their sleep needs versus the fianc\u00e9's habits.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper and needs a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9's actions are clearly disruptive. Even though he sometimes lowers the volume slightly, the problem persists every night. The author tried to communicate this and reached a breaking point.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9's argument is that separate rooms would make them just roommates. But the author is arguing their right to a good night's sleep, which is essential for health. They've been together for 8 years, so this isn't a new issue. The author's request isn't about wanting privacy for other reasons but specifically for rest. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing ongoing stress and poor sleep, which can affect mental health and relationships.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and accommodation are important. The fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adjust his habits, which are causing harm. The author's solution is a practical step to address a legitimate issue. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about the symbolic aspect of sharing a room rather than the actual problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
