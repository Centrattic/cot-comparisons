I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to sleep in separate rooms. They've been with their fianc\u00e9 for 8 years, engaged for a year, and have two kids. The main issue is about sleeping arrangements. The user is a light sleeper and the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches TV loudly at night. The user tried to compromise by asking to lower the TV volume, but the fianc\u00e9 can't hear the change while asleep. The user finally suggested separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking they're just being roommates instead of a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's need for sleep is important. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health, mood, and overall well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014snoring and TV volume\u2014are causing the problem. The user has tried to compromise, like adjusting the volume, but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9 argues that not sharing a bed would make them roommates. But the user's main goal is to get rest, which is crucial.\n\nNext, societal norms around couples sleeping together. While it's common for couples to share a bed, there's no one-size-fits-all. Some couples do sleep in separate rooms for various reasons like sleep disorders, differing schedules, etc. The user's situation seems valid because they've been dealing with this for years. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from a place of insecurity or feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the user wrong.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The user waited a long time before suggesting separate rooms. They tried adjusting the volume, but it didn't work. The fianc\u00e9's response is about the symbolic meaning of sharing a bed, but the user's health and well-being are priorities. The user is not being selfish; they're addressing a long-standing issue that affects their daily life.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The user could have tried other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or medical consultation for the snoring. But the user mentioned trying to lower the TV volume, which the fianc\u00e9 can't hear in his sleep. Maybe other solutions are not feasible here. Also, the fianc\u00e9's TV habit is a choice, but he's not willing to adjust it. The user's request for separate rooms is a last resort after years of poor sleep.\n\nIn conclusion, the user is not in the wrong. Their need for a good night's sleep is valid, especially with their health and family responsibilities. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the relationship dynamic than the user's right to rest. So the answer should be B.\n"
