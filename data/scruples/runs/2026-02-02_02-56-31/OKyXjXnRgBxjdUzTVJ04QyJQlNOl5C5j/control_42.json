I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is about conflicting sleep habits. The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows and snores a lot. They've been dealing with this for years, even with kids involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the author significant sleep disruption. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health and well-being. The author has tried to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. After 8 years together, it's understandable that they're at their breaking point. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the request for separate rooms is a big deal, implying that they're not a real couple anymore. But the author isn't suggesting a breakup, just a practical solution to a longstanding problem. They want to maintain the relationship but need their own space for rest. \n\nThe key points here are the length of the relationship, the persistent issue, and the author's need for self-care. It's reasonable for someone to prioritize their health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be a knee-jerk reaction rather than considering the author's valid concerns. \n\nIn similar situations, solutions like using earplugs, a white noise machine, or a sleep mask can help, but if those aren't effective, separate rooms might be necessary. The author isn't being selfish; they're addressing a real issue that affects their quality of life. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking a solution after enduring problems for a long time. The fianc\u00e9 might need to be more empathetic and find a way to accommodate both needs, whether through separate rooms or other compromises. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
