I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they want to sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and watches TV loud at night. The fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to compromise, and now the person is considering separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The person is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for a long time\u20148 years together, engaged for a year, two kids. They mention that every night the fianc\u00e9 watches loud action movies and falls asleep, causing disturbance. They've tried turning it down, but the fianc\u00e9 gets upset even in his sleep. The fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, then what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates.\n\nSo, the main issue is about finding a compromise. The person's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health, mood, and overall well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are long-standing, and he might not realize how disruptive they are. However, the person has tried to communicate and compromise before, but it's not working. \n\nIs suggesting separate rooms a reasonable solution? In some cases, couples do sleep in separate rooms for various reasons like sleep disorders, and it can work if both are comfortable. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant, thinking it makes them just roommates. But the person argues they need their own space for health reasons. \n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their request is unreasonable. Since they've tried adjusting and it's not working, and their need for sleep is legitimate, they might not be in the wrong. However, the way they presented the request (\"went psycho\") might have been abrupt, but the underlying issue is valid. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to adapt could also be part of the problem. \n\nConsidering all that, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking a solution that affects their well-being. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
