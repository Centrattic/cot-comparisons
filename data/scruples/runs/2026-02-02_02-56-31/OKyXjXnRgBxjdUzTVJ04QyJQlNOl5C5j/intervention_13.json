I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. They've been together 8 years, engaged for a year, have two kids, and have been dealing with this sleep issue for a long time.\n\nThe main points here are the couple's different sleeping habits. The user is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment, while the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV at a loud volume. The fianc\u00e9's TV watching with explosions and loud sounds is causing the user to have poor sleep. The user tried to turn it down, but the fianc\u00e9 wakes up in his sleep when it's too low. The user finally had enough and suggested separate rooms, leading to the fianc\u00e9 being upset and questioning their relationship's purpose.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong. The user is advocating for their own well-being, which is important. Sleep is crucial for health, and the situation has been ongoing for years. The fianc\u00e9's habits are clearly problematic here. However, relationships require compromise. The user's solution is to sleep separately, which might seem like a drastic step, but if the other person isn't willing to adjust, maybe it's necessary.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response is dismissive, suggesting that if they can't share a bed, there's no point in being a couple. That's a bit extreme. The user has been patient for years, and it's reasonable to seek a solution that works for both. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't made significant efforts to adjust his habits beyond lowering the volume by a little. So the user's frustration is valid. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners have a role. The fianc\u00e9's TV habit is the root problem, and the user is trying to find a solution. The user isn't being unreasonable by seeking better sleep. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about the separation than solving the problem. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms if the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to make necessary changes. So the answer is B.\n"
