I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, uses the TV loudly, and they can't sleep well. They've been together a long time with kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The person's need for quiet is valid. Chronic sleep issues are serious and can affect health. They've tried compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response suggests feelings of rejection, which is understandable. But the user's primary concern is their well-being and health.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. It's not just about one person's comfort but mutual respect. The user is proposing a solution that benefits their health, which is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9 might need to adjust his habits, but if that's not possible, separate rooms could be a practical solution. Since they have kids, the children might also benefit from parents who are well-rested and less stressed.\n\nHowever, relationships require communication and compromise. The user might need to explain the health impact and work on finding a middle ground. Maybe alternative solutions like earplugs, a white noise machine, or adjusting the TV setup. But if those don't work, separate rooms are a reasonable step. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is about feeling rejected, but the user's health is a valid concern.\n\nLooking at similar situations, often the person seeking better health isn't in the wrong. It's about finding a balance. So the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
