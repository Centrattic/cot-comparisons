I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves differing sleep habits: the author is a light sleeper who needs quiet, while the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loudly at night. They've been together for eight years, engaged for a year, and have two kids. The author is frustrated after years of poor sleep and finally suggests separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health, mood, and overall well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, even though he sometimes compromises. The author tried to address it but the fianc\u00e9's response is dismissive, even in sleep. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the suggestion is a major step, implying a breakdown in their relationship. He argues that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates. However, the author's request is about personal health and comfort, not a rejection of the relationship. \n\nThey've been together a long time, so this isn't a new issue. The author has endured it for years. The fianc\u00e9's willingness to compromise seems limited; lowering the volume by 3 points isn't really a significant change. The author's frustration is justified. \n\nSeparate sleeping arrangements are a common solution for couples with incompatible needs. It's a practical solution rather than a relationship problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling attacked or not understanding the severity of the sleep issue. \n\nSo, evaluating responsibility: the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution to a legitimate problem. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause, but the author's action is a reasonable response. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
