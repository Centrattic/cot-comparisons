I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows and snores a lot. The author is exhausted and finally had enough, so they proposed separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea for their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: poor sleep affects health, and they've been dealing with this for years. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues, so their concern is legitimate. The fianc\u00e9's side is that he's used to his routine, maybe he's not aware of how much noise he's making, or he might feel that separate rooms would distance them. But he's compromising by lowering the volume a bit, but not enough for the author.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author tried to handle it before, but it's been a long time and the problem persists. Suggesting separate rooms is a way to prioritize their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about how it affects the relationship rather than addressing the author's needs. However, relationships do require some level of shared experiences, like sleeping together. But if that's causing harm to one person's health, maybe the compromise is necessary.\n\nI should check if there were other options. Maybe the author could have tried earplugs or a white noise machine, but they might have already tried those. The fianc\u00e9's habit of turning the TV down a little might not be sufficient. The author's action is a last resort after years of struggle. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates is a bit extreme, as couples can choose to sleep separately for various reasons without it meaning they're just roommates. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate need for rest, which is crucial for their health. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more considerate of the author's needs, not the other way around. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
