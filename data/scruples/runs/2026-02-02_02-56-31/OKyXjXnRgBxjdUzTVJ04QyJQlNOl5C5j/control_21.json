I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because of the partner's heavy snoring and need for loud TV volume.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a light sleeper, which means they need a quiet environment to sleep well. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and keeps the TV on at a high volume, which is causing the author to have poor sleep. The partner doesn't seem to be able to adjust their habits, even when the author tries to turn down the TV, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault for suggesting separate rooms. The options are A (they are wrong) or B (they're not wrong). \n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years and has two kids. The fianc\u00e9's behavior isn't just occasional; it's every night. The author's health is affected by lack of sleep, which is a legitimate concern. The partner's response is to question the relationship's validity if they can't share a bed, which seems dismissive of the author's needs.\n\nPossible angles to consider: communication, mutual respect, willingness to compromise. The author tried to adjust by turning down the TV, but the partner's response is to get upset in sleep. The author's solution is to move to a separate room, which is a practical approach to solve the problem. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners consider each other's well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust (even reducing the volume slightly as he does) might indicate a lack of consideration. However, the author's unilateral decision without perhaps more discussion might be seen as abrupt. But given the duration and the partner's resistance to change, it's a reasonable step.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for their request. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the principle of sharing a bed rather than addressing the actual problem. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
