I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they want to sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9's sleeping habits are causing them a lot of stress and poor sleep. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, uses loud TV for sleep, and the author is a light sleeper.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. Their sleep is consistently disturbed by the TV and snoring. They mention that they've tried compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author's health and well-being are important here; chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues. So from that perspective, the author is trying to take a step to improve their quality of life, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping in separate rooms would make them just roommates. He might feel that the author is rejecting the relationship or not making an effort to work through the issue. However, the author has already tried to accommodate by adjusting their environment, and it's not working. The fianc\u00e9's need for the TV on loud might also be a personal issue, perhaps something he developed over time, but it's causing a conflict.\n\nI should think about common solutions for couples with sleep issues. Sometimes separate rooms or separate beds are recommended, especially when there's snoring or other disturbances. It's not uncommon for couples to do this, and it doesn't necessarily mean they're in the wrong. The author is prioritizing their health, which is important.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about feeling rejected than the actual problem. But the author's right to have a good sleep is valid. They've been together a long time, so maybe there's a history of this issue not being resolved. The author's breaking point after 8 years isn't unreasonable. They're engaged, so they might be thinking about marriage and their long-term health.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate problem that's affecting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's response is more about the emotional aspect of the solution rather than the problem itself. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
