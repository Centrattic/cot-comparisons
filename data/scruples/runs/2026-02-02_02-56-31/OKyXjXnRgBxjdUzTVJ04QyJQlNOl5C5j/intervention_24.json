I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is sleep habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, uses the TV loudly at night, and the person is a light sleeper, so they can't sleep well. They're engaged, have two kids, and been together eight years. The fianc\u00e9 thinks sleeping separately is bad because it's like being roommates, not a couple.\n\nHmm. Well, the person is clearly struggling with sleep because of their partner's habits. They've tried to compromise, like lowering the TV a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response is about the symbolic meaning of sharing a room, but the person's health and well-being are at stake here. Sleep is important for everyone's health. If they can't resolve this, sleeping separately might be a practical solution to ensure rest. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates is a bit of a red herring; the core issue is the sleep problem. The person isn't being unreasonable. They've tried to make adjustments, but it's not working. So, I think they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
