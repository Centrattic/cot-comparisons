I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation: they're a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV. They've been dealing with this for years. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it's bad because they'd just be roommates if they don't share a bed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's need for a good night's sleep is valid, especially since they've been dealing with this for a long time. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and relationships. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and the user is at their limit. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 argues that separate rooms would make them just roommates. But roommates typically don't have the same level of emotional connection or commitment as a couple. However, the user's well-being is important. They've tried compromises, like adjusting the volume, but it's not working. \n\nThe user's action is about seeking a solution to a long-standing problem. It's not about avoiding the relationship but about addressing a legitimate need. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about feeling criticized or defensive. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. They're trying to find a way to coexist healthily. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be understanding of the user's needs, even if it means changing their habits. Sleep is crucial, and the user's proposal is a reasonable solution when other compromises fail. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
