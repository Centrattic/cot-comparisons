I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 who's a heavy sleeper and likes the TV on loud, causing the author to have poor sleep. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise. They've been together 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 thinks separate rooms mean they might as well be roommates, but the author just wants good sleep.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's need for sleep versus the fianc\u00e9's habits. The author has been dealing with this for a long time and finally had enough. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress. The question is whether the author is wrong for suggesting separate rooms.\n\nFrom a relationship dynamics perspective, communication and mutual respect are important. The author has tried to compromise (lowering TV volume a bit), but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be more about the symbolism of sharing a bed as a couple, while the author is focused on their health and well-being. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're addressing a legitimate need after years of discomfort. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting their health, and seeking a solution is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to prioritize the relationship's form over the practical aspects, which isn't fair. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
