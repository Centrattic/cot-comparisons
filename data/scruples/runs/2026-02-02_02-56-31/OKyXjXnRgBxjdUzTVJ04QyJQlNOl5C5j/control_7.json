I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation involves the author being a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and TV volume issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to noise. They've been dealing with this for years. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The author's request for separate rooms is to get rest, which is a basic need. \n\nBut relationships often involve compromises. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is giving up on sharing a room, which is a common aspect of a relationship. However, the author's health and well-being are important. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious consequences. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response about being roommates instead of a couple raises questions about how they handle conflicts. Maybe there's a communication issue here. The author tried to find solutions (lowering volume) but it's not working. \n\nIn many cases, couples do sleep in separate rooms for various reasons. It's a personal choice and can be valid if it's what's best for their health. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're asking for a solution to a long-standing problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
