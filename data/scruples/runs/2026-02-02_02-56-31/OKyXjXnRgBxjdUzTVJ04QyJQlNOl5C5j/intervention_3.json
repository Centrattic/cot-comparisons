I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms from their fianc\u00e9. The main issue here is their different sleeping habits. The user is a light sleeper who needs quiet, while their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores and watches TV loudly at night. They've been together 8 years with two kids, so they've been dealing with this for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health, mood, and overall well-being. They've tried to communicate and compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume sometimes, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response about being roommates instead of a couple seems dismissive of the user's legitimate need. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits might be due to personal preferences or even possible sleep disorders (like snoring). He might not realize how it affects the user. The user's solution is to sleep separately, which is a common strategy in relationships where sleep habits conflict. It's not uncommon for couples to do this to maintain their health and the relationship.\n\nThe user has tried to adjust as much as possible, but it's been a long-standing issue. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to prioritize the symbolic aspect of sharing a bed over the practical need for rest. The user's main goal is to improve their sleep, which is essential. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's about being a couple vs. roommates is a bit of a red herring; the core issue is their individual needs conflicting.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't being unreasonable. They're trying to find a solution that allows both to function well. The fianc\u00e9 might need to consider alternatives like a white noise machine, or maybe he could sleep in a different room too. But the user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
