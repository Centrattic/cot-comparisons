I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The background is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and watches TV at a loud volume. The user is a light sleeper and has been struggling with their sleep for years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the user significant sleep issues. The user tried to find a solution by suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, feeling it undermines their relationship. The couple has been together a long time and has kids.\n\nNow, the user's actions: They brought up sleeping in separate rooms as a solution to their sleep problems. The question is whether that makes them at fault. On one hand, the user is prioritizing their own well-being and health, which is understandable. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health impacts. The fianc\u00e9's habits are not something the user can control, so suggesting a separation might be a practical solution.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel rejected or see it as a step away from intimacy. Relationships do involve compromise, and the user could have tried other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV volume. But the user mentions they've tried some compromises already, like lowering the volume a bit, which hasn't worked. The fianc\u00e9 even turns it back up when the user does.\n\nThe user's frustration is valid. Long-term sleep issues can cause stress and affect overall health. The engagement and children add another layer, as family dynamics and children's well-being are also at stake. The user's request is about creating a better living environment for themselves, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is also important. The user's solution might not address the root of the problem and could lead to further conflict. Maybe there are medical solutions for snoring, like a CPAP machine. The user could have suggested that as an alternative. But since the user tried and it's not working, maybe separate rooms are necessary.\n\nIn terms of fault, the user isn't in the wrong for advocating for their own health. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is also a valid concern, but the problem isn't the suggestion itself. The core issue is the incompatibility in sleep habits. The user isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking a solution that's been ignored despite efforts. So the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
