I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're at fault for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV loudly at night. The fianc\u00e9's TV habits disrupt the user's sleep, leading to poor rest. The user finally suggests separate rooms, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it, thinking it's not right for a couple.\n\nNow, considering the user's needs for good sleep, which is important for health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent problems. The user has tried compromising, like lowering the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response in sleep when the TV is turned down complicates things further. \n\nLong-term relationship with kids involved means this isn't a spur-of-the-moment issue. The user has been dealing with this for years. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates seems dismissive of the user's legitimate need for rest. \n\nSo, the user's request is about health and quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's habits are objectively disruptive, and the user isn't being unreasonable in seeking a solution. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
