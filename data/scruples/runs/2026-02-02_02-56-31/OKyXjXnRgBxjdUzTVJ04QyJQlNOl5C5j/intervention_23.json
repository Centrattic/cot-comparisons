I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. They've been together eight years, engaged for a year, with two kids. The main issue is differing sleep needs.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper needing quiet, while the other is a heavy sleeper who uses loud TV. The user says they've tried compromises but it's not working. They're frustrated and want better sleep. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it's bad because it's about being together.\n\nHmm. So arguments for the user not being in the wrong: their health and well-being matter. Chronic sleep issues can be serious. They've tried to compromise but it's not working. They're not rejecting the relationship but seeking a solution for their needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is about the relationship dynamics. However, the user's need isn't being met despite efforts. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the user's health. Sleeping separately might be a reasonable solution if co-sleeping isn't possible. Since they have kids, maybe separate rooms aren't new, but it's a practical solution here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B: No, the user isn't in the wrong. They are prioritizing their health and seeking a solution for a long-standing problem that affects their quality of life.\n"
