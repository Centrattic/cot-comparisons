I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is a light sleeper and needs a quiet, distraction-free environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on watching TV at a high volume. The user has been dealing with this for years, and the fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to compromise enough. The user finally had enough and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's bad for the relationship. They have two kids and have been engaged for a year.\n\nI need to consider the key points. The user's need for rest is valid. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and he's not willing to adjust. The user is seeking a solution after years of suffering. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be about the relationship's definition, but the user's health is at stake.\n\nPossible angles: Is it reasonable to ask for separate rooms when one partner's habits are harming the other's health? Relationships require compromise. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to make necessary changes, the user's action is justified. On the other hand, separate rooms might be seen as a radical step, but if all else has failed, it's a valid choice. The user's intention is to improve their own well-being, which is important. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates is maybe minimizing the user's needs. The user isn't trying to end the relationship, just find a way to coexist better.\n\nSo, likely the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The user's action is a reasonable step after long-term issues and lack of compromise from the other side.\n"
