I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author is engaged, has two kids, and has been with their fianc\u00e9 for 8 years, engaged for 1. They mention being a light sleeper and needing a quiet room. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and insists on watching TV with high volume, even when he's asleep. The author tried to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but the noise still disrupts their sleep. The situation has gotten to a point where the author is exhausted and wants to sleep in a separate room.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is that this would make them just roommates, not a couple. The author argues they've been dealing with this for a long time and need good sleep.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me think. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant sleep issues, which are common in relationships. But the author is suggesting a physical separation. Is that a reasonable solution? Well, people do choose separate beds or rooms for various reasons, like sleep disorders or differing schedules. The key here is whether the author's request is unreasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 seems to have a valid need for their own sleeping environment (maybe they can't sleep without the TV, which is a bit odd, but possible). However, the author's need for sleep is also valid. The problem is the conflict between their needs. The author's solution is to sleep apart, which might be a practical way to resolve the issue without further conflict. The fianc\u00e9's resistance is based on the idea that sharing a bed is a sign of a committed relationship, but if they can't find a middle ground, the author's health and well-being could suffer.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. They've tried to compromise (lowering the volume slightly) but it's not enough. Sleep is essential for health, and chronic sleep deprivation can lead to bigger problems. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is contributing to the issue, and the author is seeking a solution. So, B (not in the wrong) makes sense.\n"
