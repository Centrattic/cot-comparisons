I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and plays loud TV, which disrupts their sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for a long time, 8 years together, engaged for a year, and they have two kids. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has a different sleep habit and isn't accommodating enough. He sleeps with the TV on loud and doesn't adjust it much when asked. The author is frustrated and can't take it anymore, so they suggest separate rooms.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that if they can't share a bed, then what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates. But the author wants good sleep. \n\nI think the key points here are the duration of the problem, the attempts to compromise (the fianc\u00e9 lowers the volume a little sometimes), and the fact that the author is exhausted. The fianc\u00e9's behavior isn't just occasional; it's every night. The author has tried and is at their limit. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't being unreasonable. They're seeking a solution to a persistent problem that affects their health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive. So the author isn't in the wrong for trying to find a solution. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground? Like using earplugs or a white noise machine? However, the author might have tried those already. The question is whether suggesting separate rooms is unreasonable. Since the problem is every night and has been for years, it's not just a temporary issue. The author's health and ability to function could be at stake. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking action after prolonged issues. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the separation than the actual problem.\n"
