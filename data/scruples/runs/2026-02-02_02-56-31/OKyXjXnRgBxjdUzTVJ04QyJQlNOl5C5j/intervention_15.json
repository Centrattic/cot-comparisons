I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. They're a light sleeper, their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loud at night. They've been dealing with this for years, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is against the idea, saying it would make them roommates.\n\nHmm. The user's main issue is lack of sleep due to the partner's habits. They tried compromising, but the volume only gets lowered a little. The partner's response is emotional, questioning the relationship. \n\nI think the key here is whether the user's request is reasonable. Sleep is important for health, and if the partner isn't willing to adjust despite the user's efforts, maybe the user has a valid point. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates seems like a misunderstanding of the issue. The user isn't rejecting the relationship but seeking a solution for their well-being. So probably answer B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
