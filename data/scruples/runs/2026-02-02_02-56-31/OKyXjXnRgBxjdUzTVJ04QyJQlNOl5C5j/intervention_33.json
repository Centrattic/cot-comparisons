I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9 has a really loud TV on while they sleep, which they can't handle because they're a light sleeper. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and doesn't seem to respond to the volume being lowered a bit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user wants a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent disruption. They've been together for 8 years, which is a long time, so it's not like this is a new issue. The user says they've been dealing with it \"forever,\" so the problem has been ongoing without resolution.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response is that if they can't share a bed, then why be a couple instead of roommates. That's a bit of a dismissive response. It doesn't acknowledge the user's legitimate need for rest. The user's main issue is the noise from the TV, which is causing sleep issues. The compromise the fianc\u00e9 makes is lowering the volume by 3 points, but that's not enough. The user has tried to address it, but it's not working.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make considerations for each other's well-being. If one partner's habits are significantly affecting the other's health (like chronic sleep deprivation), then finding a solution is important. Sleeping in separate rooms could be a solution, especially if other compromises have failed. The user isn't asking to end the relationship, just to have better sleep. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9's argument is about the couple's dynamic. But that's more about the symbolic aspect of sharing a room rather than the actual problem. The user's health and rest are crucial. The fianc\u00e9 could also adjust more, like turning the TV off or using headphones if possible. There might be other solutions, but if those aren't feasible, separate rooms are a reasonable step.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. They're seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that's affecting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to not take the issue seriously enough. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
