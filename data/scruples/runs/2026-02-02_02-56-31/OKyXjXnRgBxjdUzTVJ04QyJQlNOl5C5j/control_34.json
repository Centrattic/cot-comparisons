I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The background is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud action movies with the TV on, and the author can't sleep because of it. They've been dealing with this for a long time and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted, leading to poor rest. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's behavior\u2014watching loud TV at night\u2014is causing the problem. He's not responsive to compromises, like lowering the volume a bit. The author feels they've tried to accommodate but it's not enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 views the suggestion as ending the relationship's intimacy, comparing it to being roommates. His perspective is that sleeping apart is a sign of giving up on the relationship. However, the author argues that the need for rest is crucial, especially with two kids.\n\nI should check if there are other possible solutions the author considered. Maybe they tried white noise machines, earplugs, or different sleeping arrangements. The post mentions the fianc\u00e9 doesn't respond well to turning down the volume, even slightly. The author tried, but it's not working. The engagement is a year long, so they're planning to marry, but this issue is longstanding.\n\nThe key here is that the author is prioritizing their health and well-being, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting not just the author's sleep but potentially their overall health. The author isn't suggesting moving out but just separate rooms, which is a common solution in some couples. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might be due to not seeing the severity of the issue or not understanding the impact on the author.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried compromises, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't adapting. The need for rest is legitimate. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
