I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. They provided a detailed situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on at a loud volume and snores a lot. The user is a light sleeper, so they can't sleep with all that noise. They've been dealing with this for 8 years together, engaged for 1, with two kids. They tried to get a good sleep but now suggest separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, thinking it's the end of their relationship as roommates. \n\nThe user's main issue is their own well-being. They can't sleep properly, leading to shitty sleep. They've tried compromising (like lowering the volume a bit), but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive, and the user is at their breaking point. \n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. The question is about right or wrong. In relationships, partners are supposed to support each other's needs. If one partner's habits are causing harm to the other, it's generally expected that they find a solution. The user is trying to find a solution that works for them. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant, but that doesn't mean the user is wrong. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that they could just be roommates is a bit extreme. Roommates don't necessarily share the same sleeping arrangements either, so that comparison might not hold. The user is looking for a compromise that allows them to have rest while being in a committed relationship. \n\nOther factors: The user has been dealing with this for a long time, and the fianc\u00e9 has shown minimal compromise (lowering volume by 3 points). The user's health and well-being are important. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health, so this isn't trivial. The fianc\u00e9's habit is causing harm, so the user is justified in seeking a solution. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The user is trying to address a legitimate issue affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9 needs to find a solution that works for both, maybe finding a middle ground, but the user isn't wrong to suggest separate rooms if necessary.\n"
