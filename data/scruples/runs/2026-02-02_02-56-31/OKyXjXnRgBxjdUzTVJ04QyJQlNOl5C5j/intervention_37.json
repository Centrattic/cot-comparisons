I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9 has a TV on at a loud volume while they sleep, which is causing the user a lot of sleep issues. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and doesn't seem to be able to adjust, even when he compromises a bit. The user is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for years. They've been engaged for a year and together for eight, with two kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's main issue is their sleep being disrupted. Chronic lack of good sleep can have serious health impacts. They've tried to communicate, but the fianc\u00e9's response is to question the relationship's validity if they don't share a room. The fianc\u00e9's side is that he needs the TV on for sleep, maybe for comfort or habit, and he's not waking up when the volume is lowered. But he's not addressing his snoring, which is another issue.\n\nThe user's suggestion to sleep separately is a solution to their problem. They're not in the wrong for seeking a way to get rest, especially after years of struggle. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the emotional aspect rather than solving the problem. The user isn't rejecting the relationship but seeking a practical solution. So, the answer is likely B. They're not in the wrong.\n"
