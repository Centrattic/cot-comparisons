I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. They're a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loudly at night. They've been dealing with this for 8 years, have two kids, and are engaged. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea and questions their relationship. \n\nFirst, the user's need for a good sleep is valid. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014snoring, TV volume\u2014are causing this problem. The user has tried to communicate and compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 adjusting the volume a bit, but it's not enough. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response seems more about the emotional aspect of the relationship rather than the practical issue. Saying that not sharing a bed means being just roommates is a bit of a dramatic reaction. It's possible he sees the suggestion as a sign of deeper issues or a loss of intimacy.\n\nHowever, the user's main concern is a basic need for rest. They\u2019re not being unreasonable. It's a common issue in long-term relationships where differing sleep needs arise. Suggesting separate rooms is a practical solution to a problem that's been ongoing for years. \n\nBut there might be other solutions they haven't tried yet, like earplugs, white noise machines, or even medical consultation for the snoring. But the user might have already considered these and found them ineffective. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's insistence on the TV on at night is a personal preference that's conflicting with the user's needs. The user's frustration is justified after enduring this for so long. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties need to communicate and find a compromise. However, the user isn't the one at fault for wanting to address their sleep issues. It's a matter of mutual respect for each other's needs. \n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The user is justified in seeking a solution to their sleep problems, even if it means separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the relationship dynamic than the user's suggestion itself.\n"
