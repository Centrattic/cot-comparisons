I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms because of differences in sleep habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and requires the TV on at a high volume, which disturbs the author's sleep. The author has been dealing with this for a long time, with two kids and being engaged for a year. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author is a light sleeper who values quiet and a peaceful environment. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014snores loudly and insists on having the TV on\u2014are causing significant disruption. The author's request for separate rooms is to get better sleep, which is a basic need. However, the fianc\u00e9 sees it as undermining their relationship, equating separate rooms to just being roommates.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, considering the health impact of chronic sleep disruption, it's a valid concern. The author has tried to communicate and compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit. But the problem persists. The author's request seems reasonable if the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to make further adjustments. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is prioritizing sleep over the relationship's intimacy. However, long-term health and well-being from good sleep are crucial. The author has been through this for 8 years, which is a long time. Sacrificing sleep could affect their health and happiness. \n\nSo, the author's stance is about their well-being. The fianc\u00e9 needs to consider that sleep deprivation can lead to serious health issues. The author isn't being selfish; they're seeking a solution to a problem that's affecting their quality of life. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs after enduring the issue for years. The fianc\u00e9 should be more understanding and open to solutions that meet both their needs, maybe finding a middle ground like a white noise machine or a different TV setup. \n\nAnswer B: No.\n"
