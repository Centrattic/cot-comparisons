I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The person is asking if they're the asshole for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud movies at night, making it impossible for them to sleep. They've been dealing with this for a long time, and now they've had enough.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the author significant sleep issues. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health, mood, and overall well-being. The fianc\u00e9, though, might feel that the TV helps him sleep and that the author is overreacting. But the author has tried compromising, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. \n\nThe key points here are the duration of the problem (8 years together, engaged for 1 with kids), the impact on the author's health, and the fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to make changes. The author isn't just being petty; they're seeking a solution to a long-standing issue that affects their quality of life. Sleeping apart might be a last resort after many failed attempts to adjust. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping apart undermines their relationship, suggesting that sharing a bed is a fundamental part of being a couple. But if the shared space is causing harm, then prioritizing health is reasonable. The author isn't rejecting the relationship but trying to find a way to coexist better. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to meet in the middle. If one's needs are consistently ignored, it's fair to seek alternatives. The author isn't wrong for wanting to address their needs, especially after years of struggle. The fianc\u00e9 might need to adapt more, like using earplugs or finding a different way to sleep, but if he can't or won't, the author's solution is valid. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
