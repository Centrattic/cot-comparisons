I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is their different sleep habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV loudly at night. The user is a light sleeper and can't get good sleep because of this. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health, mood, and overall well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the request is a big step that affects their relationship dynamic. He might see sleeping together as a fundamental part of being a couple, so his reaction is about the relationship's future.\n\nThe user has tried to compromise, like lowering the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. They've been dealing with this for years, which adds to the frustration. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is about commitment and the symbolic meaning of sharing a bed. However, practical solutions like separate rooms might be necessary for their health and marriage in the long run. \n\nIn relationships, meeting each other's needs is crucial. If both can't find a middle ground, separate sleeping arrangements might be a reasonable solution. The user isn't suggesting moving out but just separate rooms in the same house. So, the answer would depend on whether the user's action is a fair compromise given the circumstances. Since they've tried some compromises and it's been a long-standing issue, suggesting separate rooms might be justified. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
