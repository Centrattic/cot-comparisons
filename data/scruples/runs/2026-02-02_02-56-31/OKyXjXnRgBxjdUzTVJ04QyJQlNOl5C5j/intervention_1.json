I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThey have a fianc\u00e9 who's a heavy sleeper and needs the TV on loud. The user is a light sleeper, so they can't sleep with the noise. This has been going on for 8 years with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 thinks sleeping apart is bad because they could just be roommates otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's need for a good night's sleep is important for their well-being. Chronic poor sleep can affect health, mood, and relationships. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem. The user has tried compromises, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response about being roommates seems dismissive. The user's request is about their health and happiness, which is valid. Maybe there are other solutions, like a white noise machine or earplugs, but if those don't work, separate rooms could be a reasonable option. \n\nI should check if the user's actions are overreacting. They tried to work around the issue but eventually had to set a boundary. It's about self-care. Also, the duration of the problem\u20148 years\u2014shows it's been ongoing. \n\nRed flags in the fianc\u00e9's behavior: not being responsive to compromises, thinking the solution is to stop being a couple, which is a bit extreme. The user isn't asking for a breakup, just a separate space for sleep. \n\nIn relationships, meeting each other's needs is key. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't adjusting and it's causing significant distress, the user isn't wrong to seek a change. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
