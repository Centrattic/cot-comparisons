I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, loud snorer, and watches TV loudly. They've been dealing with this for years with kids, and now they want separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive. The user is a light sleeper, which means the noise from TV and snoring affects their sleep. Chronic lack of sleep can have health impacts, so that's a valid concern. The user has tried compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9 argues that separate rooms would make them just roommates, but they are engaged with two kids, so this is a big change.\n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? Well, wanting to improve their quality of life is understandable. Suggesting a solution that addresses a long-standing problem isn't inherently wrong. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's needs. If the fianc\u00e9's habits are causing harm, the user isn't wrong for seeking a resolution. However, communication is key. Did they discuss this before? The user mentions they had a discussion, and the fianc\u00e9 didn't agree. But the user's health and well-being matter too. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel rejected or hurt if separated. However, the user isn't suggesting separation for the relationship's sake, just for better sleep. It's about cohabitation dynamics. There's no indication that the user is avoiding intimacy or other relationship aspects. They want a good night's sleep, which is basic. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong. They've tried compromises and are taking steps to address their needs. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root issue here. Answer B.\n"
