I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is engaged and has been with their partner for 8 years, engaged for 1 year, and they have two kids. The main issue is about sleeping arrangements. The author is a light sleeper and wants a quiet room, but their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 watches action movies with loud noises and falls asleep, which disturbs the author. The author tried to ask him to lower the volume, but he doesn't notice even when he's asleep. The author finally had enough and suggested sleeping in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, thinking it's just like being roommates. The author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's request is about their well-being and health. Lack of sleep can have serious effects on physical and mental health. It's reasonable for someone to want a good night's rest. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent disruption. The author has tried compromising, like lowering the volume a bit, but it hasn't helped enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is overreacting or not making enough effort. He might believe that they should work through the issue together instead of separating. However, after 8 years together, it's not unreasonable for the author to seek a solution that works for both. The fianc\u00e9's sleeping habits are not something that can be easily changed, especially if he's asleep when the volume is an issue.\n\nThe key points here are the health impact of poor sleep, the duration of the problem (8 years), and the attempts at compromise. The author is prioritizing their own health, which is important. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates seems to be a misunderstanding of the situation. The author isn't rejecting the relationship but is looking for a practical solution to a longstanding problem.\n\nI think the author is justified in their request. They've tried to make compromises, but the situation is affecting their sleep and well-being. Suggesting separate rooms is a practical step when other solutions haven't worked. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
