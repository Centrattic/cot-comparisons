I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is about differing sleep habits. They are a light sleeper who can't handle noise, while their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on quite loudly. The user has been dealing with this for a long time and is now considering separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's need for a quiet environment is valid. Chronic sleep disruption can affect health and well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are ingrained; he's been doing this for years, maybe even before the relationship. However, the user mentions that they've been together 8 years and engaged for a year, so this isn't a new issue.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response is that separate rooms would make them just roommates. But the user is asking for a solution that allows both to have their needs met. It's about finding a compromise. The user's frustration is understandable after years of poor sleep. They might have tried discussing it before, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't adjusting. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe using earplugs or white noise machines? But the user hasn't mentioned trying those. However, if they have and it's not working, then separate rooms could be a reasonable solution. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might be emotional, seeing it as a step back from the relationship. But the user's health and rest are important. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to make sacrifices. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adjust his habits (like sleeping without TV or at a lower volume), the user has a right to seek a solution that works for them. So the user isn't in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms; they're trying to solve a long-standing problem that affects their quality of life.\n"
