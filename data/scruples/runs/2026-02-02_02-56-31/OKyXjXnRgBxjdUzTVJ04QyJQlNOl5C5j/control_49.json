I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're engaged, have been together for 8 years, two kids, and they're asking if they're at fault for wanting to sleep in separate rooms.\n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be sleeping habits. The author is a light sleeper who needs quiet, while their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who requires TV on at a loud volume and snores a lot. The fianc\u00e9's TV choice also has loud noises, which the author finds disruptive. The author is exhausted and tried turning it down, but the fianc\u00e9 gets upset even in his sleep. They suggested separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's needs are valid\u2014they want a good night's sleep. It's been a long time (8 years) with this issue. The fianc\u00e9's habits are problematic and not being resolved despite some compromises (lowering the volume a bit). The author is seeking a solution that addresses their chronic problem, which is affecting their well-being.\n\nNow, common arguments against the author might be that couples should make sacrifices for each other, that separate rooms could weaken the relationship, or that the author should have addressed this earlier. But on the other hand, the author has tried to compromise (lowering the volume), but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing significant distress, impacting health, and the author is looking for a practical solution. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. If one partner's habits are severely affecting the other's health and they've tried to resolve it but can't, seeking a solution like separate rooms might be reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about how it affects his view of the relationship rather than addressing the author's needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is trying to solve a long-standing problem that's impacting their well-being. They haven't ignored the issue but have tried to accommodate, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't as responsive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
