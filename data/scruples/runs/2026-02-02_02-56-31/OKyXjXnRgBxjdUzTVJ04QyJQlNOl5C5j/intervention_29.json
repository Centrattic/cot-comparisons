  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for suggesting to my fiance that we sleep in separate rooms?\nHere's the background. I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The main issue is their fianc\u00e9's sleep habits: he's a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at high volume. The user is a light sleeper and this affects their sleep. They've been dealing with this for years and now are considering separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The user is seeking a solution for better sleep, which is essential for health. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the request is a major change in their relationship dynamic, hence his reaction about being just roommates.\n\nSleep issues can have real health impacts, leading to fatigue, stress, and even more serious problems. The user has tried compromising, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's still not enough. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the emotional aspect of not sharing a bed, which is a common point in relationships. However, the user's need for rest is valid and persistent.\n\nIn relationships, couples often have to make adjustments for each other's well-being. If one partner's habits are causing significant harm to the other, it's reasonable to seek a solution. Sleeping in separate rooms isn't uncommon, especially when health is a concern. The user's reasoning is practical, focusing on their own well-being and the long-term health of the relationship by addressing the issue causing stress.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates might stem from a fear of emotional distance, but it's important to recognize that cohabitation doesn't require sharing a bed. Many couples have different sleeping arrangements for various reasons, and it doesn't diminish their relationship. The user's stance is about finding a sustainable solution, not about rejecting the relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate issue that affects their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might need to be addressed through communication, but the user's request is justified.\n"
