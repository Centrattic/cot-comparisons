I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants to sleep in separate rooms because the other partner is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and watches loud TV shows before bed. The fianc\u00e9 in question is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise, leading to bad sleep. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids. The main issue is the sleep disruption.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The person suggesting separate rooms is trying to get a good night's sleep, which is important for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to other issues like irritability, health problems, etc. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is used to sleeping with the TV on, which might be a long-standing habit. Maybe he uses it to fall asleep, so changing that habit could be tough for him.\n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, why be a couple instead of roommates. But the person is arguing that their need for sleep is valid. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. They've been together for a long time, so maybe they haven't found a solution that works for both. The person has tried to get the fianc\u00e9 to lower the volume, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's snoring and TV are causing consistent issues. The person is taking a drastic step, but maybe it's necessary for their health. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe using earplugs or a white noise machine? But the person might have already tried those. If the fianc\u00e9 can't adjust his habits despite the impact on the partner's sleep, then the suggestion to sleep separately might be reasonable. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about feeling that separate rooms mean the relationship is failing, but the person is just looking for a solution to a practical problem. The fact that they have kids might add stress if one parent is sleep-deprised, affecting their ability to care for the children. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the person isn't being unreasonable. They're seeking a solution to a problem that affects their daily life. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing harm, and the suggestion to sleep apart is a way to mitigate that harm. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). But maybe some might argue that they should try more solutions before separating rooms. But given the long duration and the attempts to compromise already mentioned (lowering volume sometimes), it's justified.\n"
