I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The background is that the fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper, so they need a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9's partner is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on watching TV at a volume that's disturbing. The author has been dealing with this for years, leading to poor sleep, and now wants to sleep separately. The partner is upset, thinking that not sharing a bed undermines the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is sleep deprivation due to the partner's habits. Chronic lack of sleep can have serious health effects, so this is a legitimate concern. The partner, on the other hand, might feel that the TV is a coping mechanism or that their needs aren't being considered. However, the author has tried to find compromises, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The situation has been ongoing for 8 years, which suggests it's not a new problem but a long-standing one.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and consideration for each other's well-being is key. The author is trying to take care of their health by seeking a solution. Sleeping in separate rooms might be a drastic step, but if all other compromises have failed, it could be a reasonable choice. The partner's reaction seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the relationship's validity, which might indicate an insecurity or misunderstanding about the nature of the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their health. Since the author has tried to adjust and the partner hasn't found a sustainable solution, the author's decision might be justified. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). However, I should check if there's any cultural or social expectations that might influence this. In some contexts, sleeping separately might be seen as a last resort when other solutions are impossible. Given the long duration and the health impact, the author's action is understandable.\n"
