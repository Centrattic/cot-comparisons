I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snorts and watches loud TV before bed. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear if the TV is turned down, even while asleep. The author has had enough and wants to sleep separately, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset, arguing that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates. They've been together 8 years with two kids.\n\nHmm. First, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's main issue is sleep deprivation due to their partner's habits. Chronic lack of sleep can be serious for health, so this is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has his own habits and seems to be resistant to changing them. He might feel that the request to sleep separately is a rejection of the relationship, hence his reaction about being roommates.\n\nThe author has tried to compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author's health and well-being are at stake here. It's been a long time (8 years) dealing with this, which suggests it's a persistent problem that hasn't been resolved through other means. The author's request isn't out of anger but out of necessity for their own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author isn't making enough effort to find a solution together. However, the author has tried to communicate and compromise already. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about feeling rejected rather than addressing the actual problem. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make sacrifices for each other. However, there's a limit to how much one person can accommodate the other without significant changes from both sides. The author is asking for a solution that's manageable (separate rooms) rather than expecting the fianc\u00e9 to stop snoring or change his TV habits entirely. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're prioritizing their health and well-being, which is important. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be more about the emotional aspect of the relationship rather than the practical issue. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
