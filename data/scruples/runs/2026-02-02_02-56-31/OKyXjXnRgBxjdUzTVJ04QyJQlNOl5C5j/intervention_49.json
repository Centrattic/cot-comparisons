I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms because of their partner's heavy snoring and need for loud TV. They've been together 8 years, engaged for a year, have two kids, and this has been going on forever.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user is a light sleeper and this is affecting their sleep quality. Chronic lack of good sleep can impact health, mood, and overall well-being. The partner is a heavy sleeper and uses the TV loudly, which is a problem. The user is frustrated and has tried compromising but it's not working. The partner sees sleeping apart as a sign that their relationship is just roommates, which is a valid concern about the relationship's intimacy.\n\nBut the user's main issue is their basic need for rest. Sleep is important, and if you can't get it in the shared space, maybe the solution is necessary. However, the partner's feelings about it are also important. The user didn't mention if they've tried other solutions, like earplugs, white noise machines, or maybe getting a different mattress. Maybe there's a middle ground. The suggestion of separate rooms is drastic but might be justified if all else fails.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they want a good night's sleep, which is a legitimate need. The partner's reaction is about the symbolism of sharing a room, which is part of a romantic relationship. However, the user's health and well-being shouldn't be sacrificed for the sake of tradition or relationship symbolism. If they can maintain a strong relationship without sharing a room, it might be possible. The key is whether they've communicated and tried all possible compromises before this drastic step. The user mentions that the partner sometimes lowers the volume by 3 points, but it's not enough. So maybe they've tried some compromises, but not all. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, unless there's a cultural or personal boundary that the user violated without discussion, it's more about differing needs. The user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health, but they should work on communication and find a solution that respects both needs. However, suggesting separate rooms might be the only option left. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because they have a valid reason and their health is a priority. The partner might need to find a way to adjust their own habits or consider other solutions. But if all else fails, separate rooms are understandable.\n"
