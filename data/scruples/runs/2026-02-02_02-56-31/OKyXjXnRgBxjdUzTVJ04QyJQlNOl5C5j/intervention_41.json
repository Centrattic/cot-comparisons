I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms with their fianc\u00e9. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on watching TV at a high volume. This has been going on for 8 years with two kids, so this isn't a new issue. The user has finally had enough and proposed separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of the relationship if they can't share a bed.\n\nSo, the core issue is about the conflict between the user's need for rest and the fianc\u00e9's habits. The user has tried to compromise (the fianc\u00e9 lowers the volume sometimes, but not enough). The user's main goal is to get a good night's sleep, which is essential for health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels that separate rooms would make them just roommates, implying that sharing a bed is a fundamental part of a romantic relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, no one should have to suffer through terrible sleep because of their partner's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues, so the user's request is valid. However, relationships often involve compromise. The user is asking for a significant change (separate rooms), which the fianc\u00e9 is resisting.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? They haven't done anything malicious. They're seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that affects their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling that the marriage is ending, but that's a different issue. The user's need for sleep is legitimate. While the user could explore other solutions (like earplugs, white noise machines, or medical help for snoring), if those have been tried and failed, separate rooms might be the only option left. Therefore, suggesting separate rooms isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
