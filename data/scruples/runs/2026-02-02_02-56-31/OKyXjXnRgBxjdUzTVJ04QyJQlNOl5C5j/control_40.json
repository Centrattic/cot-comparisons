I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who can't sleep due to her partner's loud snoring and his habit of watching TV at a high volume. They've been together for a long time, have kids, and she's had enough of the sleep issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is her lack of sleep because of her partner's habits. She's a light sleeper, and his TV volume and snoring make it impossible. The partner, on the other hand, is a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on for sleep. He can't hear her when she turns it down. He's arguing that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, not a couple.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, communication is key in any relationship. She's tried compromising, like lowering the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. Maybe she hasn't explored all possible solutions yet. However, considering the duration\u20148 years together\u2014she's been dealing with this for a long time. The health impact of chronic sleep deprivation is real, so her need for rest is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the partner's habits are deeply ingrained. Maybe he's tried to adjust but can't. The author is looking for a solution that prioritizes her well-being, which is understandable. Suggesting separate rooms might be a last resort, but it's a reasonable step if all else fails. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about the symbolism of sharing a bed rather than addressing the problem. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and whether there's been a reasonable attempt to resolve the issue. The author has tried compromises but is still suffering. Her priority is her health, which is important. So, likely, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
