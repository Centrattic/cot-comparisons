I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're at fault for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms due to their fianc\u00e9's sleep habits. \n\nFirst, the background: the user is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume, which disrupts the user's sleep. The fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume but not enough. The user has been dealing with this for years and finally suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, arguing that not sharing a bed undermines their relationship.\n\nSo, the main points here are about sleep needs and relationship dynamics. The user's request for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are clearly problematic here. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests that he might not fully grasp the impact of his actions or is resistant to change. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to compromise. The user has tried to communicate and even compromise (like when the fianc\u00e9 lowers the volume a bit), but the problem persists. Suggesting separate rooms might be a necessary step if co-sleeping is causing significant distress. \n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, wanting to address a long-standing issue that affects their health isn't unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates instead of a couple is a bit extreme, as separate rooms don't necessarily mean the relationship is failing. It's a practical solution to a specific problem. \n\nHowever, the user should consider if there are other solutions first, like using earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV setup. But given the duration of the problem and the fianc\u00e9's resistance to change, the user's frustration is justified. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the user is trying to resolve a legitimate issue affecting their well-being, and the fianc\u00e9 hasn't adequately addressed the problem despite repeated attempts.\n"
