I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about sleep disturbances. The user is a light sleeper and needs a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. The user has been dealing with this for a long time\u20148 years together, 1 year engaged with two kids. The fianc\u00e9's compromise is minimal, just lowering the volume slightly. The user tried to address it by suggesting separate rooms, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it, arguing that sharing a bed is important for their relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is at fault. Let's consider both sides. The user has a valid need for restful sleep, which is crucial for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various issues, so their frustration is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's habits (snoring, TV volume) are significant contributors to the problem, and he seems resistant to making real changes. The user's request for separate rooms is a practical solution given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the request is a rejection or a sign of the relationship not working. However, the user's motivation is about health and long-term well-being for both, not wanting to be apart. The key here is whether the user's solution is reasonable. Sleeping in separate rooms can work for couples if it's what they need to maintain their relationship. It's not about being in the wrong, but about finding a sustainable solution.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They've tried to communicate and compromise, but the situation has escalated due to the fianc\u00e9's inability or unwillingness to adjust. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong). The user's request is a valid attempt to improve their quality of life, which is essential for a healthy relationship.\n"
