I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper with a loud snore and watches TV loudly at night. The user is a light sleeper and can't sleep with all that noise, leading to bad sleep and frustration. They've been together for 8 years with two kids, so this has been going on a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the user significant distress. Sleeping in separate rooms is a common solution for couples with incompatible sleep needs, so it's not an unreasonable request. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a big deal because they're engaged and he thinks roommates would be better otherwise. He might feel rejected or think it's a step back from their relationship. \n\nBut the user's health and well-being are important. Chronic poor sleep can lead to health issues. The user has tried to compromise before (like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit), but it's not enough. It's been years of this, so the user is justified in seeking a solution that works for them. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about feeling criticized rather than understanding the user's needs. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they have a legitimate need for rest, and the solution proposed is practical. It's not about wanting to avoid the relationship but about improving their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9 should be more empathetic to the situation. So the answer would be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
