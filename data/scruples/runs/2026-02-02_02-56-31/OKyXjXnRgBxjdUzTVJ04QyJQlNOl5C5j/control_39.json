I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches TV loud at night. The fianc\u00e9 also can't seem to adjust the volume properly, even when he tries. The author is really tired of not getting good sleep and suggested moving to separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and thinks it's not right for a couple to not share a bed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health impacts, so that's a big deal. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the suggestion of separate rooms is a rejection or a step back from their relationship. The fianc\u00e9's behavior might have been an ongoing problem for years, and the author has been putting up with it for a long time.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could try other solutions first, like earplugs, a white noise machine, or maybe the fianc\u00e9 could use a CPAP machine if the snoring is due to sleep apnea. However, the author mentions that they've tried some compromises, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 isn't open to other solutions, making separate rooms the only viable option for the author's well-being.\n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together for 8 years and engaged for a year with two kids suggests that the author has been enduring this for a significant period. The fianc\u00e9 might not realize how bad the situation is or might not be willing to change. The author's request is about their basic need for sleep, which is essential. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates is a bit extreme, as couples can live together in separate rooms and still have a healthy relationship. It's more about cohabitation than the emotional aspect of the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're advocating for their own health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress, and the author has exhausted possible compromises. The fianc\u00e9 might need to reconsider their stance and look for solutions that allow both partners to have a good night's rest. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
