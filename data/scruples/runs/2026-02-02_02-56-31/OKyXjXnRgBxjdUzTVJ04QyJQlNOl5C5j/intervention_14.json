I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. They\u2019re a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loud. They've been together 8 years with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it's a bad idea, but the user just wants good sleep.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is the conflict between their sleep needs. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the user significant discomfort. They've tried some compromises, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The user is frustrated after years of this. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The user isn't trying to push them apart but to find a solution for their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates seems dismissive of the user's needs. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong here. They\u2019re addressing a legitimate issue affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9 should be more considerate and open to finding a middle ground. Maybe they can explore other solutions like earplugs, a white noise machine, or adjusting the TV setup. But suggesting separate rooms isn't unreasonable if other options fail. So the answer is B.\n"
