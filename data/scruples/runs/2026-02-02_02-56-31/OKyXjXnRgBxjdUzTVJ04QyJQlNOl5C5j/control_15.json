I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is engaged to their fianc\u00e9, and they've been together for eight years with two kids. They sleep in the same room, but the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and watches loud action movies on TV while sleeping. The author is a light sleeper and can't sleep with all that noise. They've tried to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but it's still too loud. The author decided to sleep in a separate room to get some rest, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship if they can't share a bed.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is about conflicting needs. The author wants peace at night, while the fianc\u00e9 has his habits that the author can't tolerate. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms. \n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a good night's sleep, which is essential for health and well-being. Chronic sleep disruption can lead to various problems. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might have developed this habit over time, and changing it could be difficult for him. However, the author has tried to communicate and compromise before, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are communication, effort to find solutions, and mutual respect. The author has tried to make compromises, but the situation hasn't improved. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant to change, which could indicate a lack of consideration for the author's needs. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners make efforts to accommodate each other. If one partner's habits severely affect the other's well-being and they refuse to adapt, it's reasonable for the affected partner to seek a solution that prioritizes their health. Sleeping in separate rooms can be a practical solution in such cases, especially if other options (like earplugs, white noise machines, or changing the TV habits) haven't worked. \n\nThe author's request isn't about ending the relationship but about improving their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the relationship itself, which might be a misunderstanding. The author isn't asking for a separation but a different sleeping arrangement to coexist peacefully. \n\nGiven that the author has tried to compromise and the fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution that benefits their health. Relationships require mutual adjustments, and if one partner is unwilling to make necessary changes, the other has the right to prioritize their well-being. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
