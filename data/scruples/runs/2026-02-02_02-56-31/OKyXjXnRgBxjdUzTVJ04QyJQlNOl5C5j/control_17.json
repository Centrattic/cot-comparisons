I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves differing sleep needs. The author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and TV habits. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't adjust the TV volume enough, leading to the author's poor sleep.\n\nFirst, consider the key points. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent sleep issues. The author's request is for their own well-being, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the relationship's validity, which could be a red flag. \n\nHowever, couples often share a bed, so the fianc\u00e9's concern isn't entirely without merit. But the author's right to a good sleep shouldn't be dismissed. The fianc\u00e9's inability to compromise (like turning down the TV more or using earplugs) might be part of the problem. Also, the author's stress and health could be affected by ongoing sleep deprivation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is seeking a solution to a legitimate problem caused by the fianc\u00e9's habits, it's not about being right or wrong, but about finding a compromise. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about feeling criticized rather than addressing the issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution to their sleep issues.\n"
