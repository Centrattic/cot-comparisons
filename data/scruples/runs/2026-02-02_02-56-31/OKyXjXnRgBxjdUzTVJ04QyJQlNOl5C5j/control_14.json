I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and needs the TV on loud. The author can't sleep because of the noise and has been dealing with this for eight years. They have two kids too.\n\nSo, the main issue is the sleep disruption. The author wants a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent problems. The author tried to compromise by turning down the volume, but it's not working. After eight years, this seems like a valid reason to seek a solution. The fianc\u00e9's response is emotional, but the author's health and well-being are at stake. \n\nSeparate rooms could be a practical solution. It's not about wanting to be roommates, but about needing rest. The author isn't being unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root of the problem here. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
