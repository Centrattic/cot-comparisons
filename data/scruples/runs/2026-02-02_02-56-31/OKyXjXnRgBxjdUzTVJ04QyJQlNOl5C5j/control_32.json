I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted on Reddit about wanting to sleep in separate rooms is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud action movies on TV at night, and the author is a light sleeper. The author can't take it anymore and suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted every night. Chronic lack of good sleep can have serious health effects. They've been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might have a different need or habit, possibly even a medical issue with snoring. But he's also not compromising enough\u2014it seems like he only lowers the volume by a little when asked. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is about the relationship dynamics\u2014saying that if they can't share a bed, what's the point. That might be more about his feelings of rejection or fear of the relationship changing. But the author's health and well-being are important too. They mentioned two kids, so stress and lack of sleep could affect the whole family.\n\nI should check if there are other possible solutions. Maybe white noise machines, earplugs, or different schedules? But the author might have tried those already. The fianc\u00e9's snoring might need medical attention, but the author's main concern here is the TV volume and the type of movies. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the fianc\u00e9 is contributing to the problem by not making sufficient adjustments. The author is seeking a solution that's necessary for their health. While separate rooms might seem drastic, it's a valid option if other solutions fail. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates versus a couple seems to be a misunderstanding of the core issue. The author isn't rejecting the relationship but seeking a practical solution for a long-standing problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate need for rest, and suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable step after years of unresolved issues. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not fully recognizing the impact on the author's well-being.\n"
