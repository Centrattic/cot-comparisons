  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for suggesting to my fiance that we sleep in separate rooms?\nHere's the background. I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 suggesting to sleep in separate rooms because of their partner's sleeping habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper and needs a quiet environment. The partner is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 has been dealing with this for years and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nHmm, first, the key points here are the impact on their well-being. Chronic sleep issues can affect health, mood, and relationships. The fianc\u00e9's request is about their own health and need for rest. The partner's response is emotional, comparing it to being roommates, which might be a bit dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's legitimate needs.\n\nBut wait, relationships involve compromise. The fianc\u00e9 has tried asking the partner to lower the volume, which the partner sometimes does. However, the partner's habit of watching TV loudly is causing consistent problems. The fianc\u00e9's solution is separate rooms, which might seem extreme, but if it's the only way to get rest, maybe it's reasonable.\n\nIs the fianc\u00e9 overreacting? They've been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. The stress from poor sleep could be significant. The partner's reaction seems more about the emotional aspect of not sharing a room, but maybe they haven't considered how important sleep is for the fianc\u00e9.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's habits might not be intentional. The fianc\u00e9 has tried to communicate and get some compromise, but the problem persists. The fianc\u00e9's solution is a last resort after years of trying to manage it. \n\nSo, considering all that, it seems like the fianc\u00e9 is justified in their request. They're prioritizing their health and well-being, which is important in a relationship. The partner might need to find a middle ground, like using earplugs or a white noise machine, but if that's not possible, separate rooms might be necessary. \n\nTherefore, the fianc\u00e9 is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
