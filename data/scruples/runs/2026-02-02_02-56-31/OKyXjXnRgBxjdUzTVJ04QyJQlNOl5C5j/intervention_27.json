I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to sleep in separate rooms from their fianc\u00e9. The main issue is about sleep disturbances caused by the fianc\u00e9's habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, uses the TV at a loud volume, and the user can't sleep well because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They've been in the relationship for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. They've been dealing with this for a long time. Their main need is a quiet environment to sleep. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to be able to adjust the TV volume enough, and even when he does, he gets upset if the volume is lowered, even in his sleep. The user is frustrated and wants better sleep, leading them to suggest separate rooms.\n\nThen there's the fianc\u00e9's viewpoint. He doesn't see the problem; he thinks the TV volume is fine. He's resistant to the idea of separate rooms, arguing that it would make them just roommates. This shows he values physical closeness and might not understand the impact of his habits on the user's health and well-being.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Communication is key here. The user tried to compromise (lowering the volume a bit), but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9 isn't acknowledging the severity of the issue. The user's health and rest are important, as sleep affects overall well-being, which in turn affects the kids and the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not wanting to change his habits, possibly due to being used to them or not realizing how disruptive they are.\n\nIs the user in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms? Well, they've tried to find a solution together but haven't succeeded. The fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to make necessary changes. The user's need for sleep is valid. While separate rooms might seem drastic, it's a solution to a long-standing problem. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates misses the point that the user's primary need isn't met, affecting the relationship's quality. Without a good solution, separate rooms could be a reasonable compromise.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The user's actions are justified given the circumstances and their attempts to find a solution without success.\n"
