I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a light sleeper and a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and TV noise. The fianc\u00e9 is used to sleeping with the TV on, which the author finds disruptive. They've been together 8 years with two kids, so this has been going on a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can be really harmful, both physically and mentally. They've tried compromising, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author is taking a drastic step by suggesting separate rooms, which is a big deal in a relationship, especially since they're engaged and have kids.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's response is that they might as well be roommates if they don't share a bed. He might feel that this is a rejection of their relationship. But he also seems to be aware of the problem (snoring, TV volume) and has made minor compromises, but maybe not enough. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSeparate rooms are a common solution for couples with incompatible sleep habits. It's not unheard of, and sometimes it's necessary for one partner's well-being. The author is not suggesting breaking up, just sleeping in different rooms to get rest. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates might be a bit extreme, as cohabiting in separate rooms doesn't preclude a romantic relationship, especially with kids involved.\n\nThe duration of the problem is a factor too. Eight years of disrupted sleep could lead to significant stress and health issues. The author's breaking point is understandable. They tried to communicate and compromise, but it's not working. So, the author isn't being unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not wanting to change his habits or not realizing the impact on the author.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author might need to explain the health consequences of not sleeping and maybe explore other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or a sleep study for the snoring. But given that they've tried some adjustments and it's not working, separate rooms could be a valid solution.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their health and well-being, which is important. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more empathetic and consider the long-term effects of his habits on the relationship and family life. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
