I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is their differing sleep needs. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The user, a light sleeper, is getting poor sleep due to the noise. They've been together for 8 years and engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's not worth it if they can't share a bed.\n\nFirst, the user's need for a quiet sleep environment is valid. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. They've tried compromising, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about the relationship's purpose, but that seems like a reaction to the suggestion rather than the problem itself.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's habits (snoring, TV noise) are beyond their control, but they should be willing to find solutions. The user isn't asking to stop being a couple, just to sleep separately for better rest. It's a common issue in relationships, and many couples manage separate beds for various reasons like snoring or different schedules.\n\nThe user's request is reasonable. They've tried to accommodate each other but reached a breaking point. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the relationship's validity, which isn't necessarily fair. The user isn't being selfish; they're seeking a solution to a long-standing problem. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
