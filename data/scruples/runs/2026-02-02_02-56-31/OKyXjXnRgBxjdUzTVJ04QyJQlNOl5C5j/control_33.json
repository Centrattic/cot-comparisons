I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches loud TV shows before bed. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't adjust the volume much, leading to the author's sleep being disrupted. They've been dealing with this for 8 years, engaged for a year, and have two kids. The fianc\u00e9 thinks sleeping separately is a bad idea because it's not like being roommates, but the author just wants good sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being affected by their partner's habits. Chronic lack of sleep can have serious health implications, so the author's desire to address this is understandable. They've tried asking for the TV volume to be lowered, but the fianc\u00e9 resists even slightly. The fianc\u00e9's position is that sharing a bed is part of being a couple, and separate rooms would make them feel like roommates.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication and compromise are key. The author has tried to communicate their needs but hasn't found a solution. The fianc\u00e9's habits might be difficult to change, especially if he's a heavy sleeper. However, the author's health and well-being are important. Sleeping in separate rooms is a common solution in some relationships when other methods fail. It's not necessarily a sign of a failing relationship if both parties are willing to prioritize each other's needs.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from a fear of losing intimacy or seeing separate rooms as a step towards separation. But the author's request is about improving their quality of life. The fact that they've been together for a long time and have kids suggests they have a committed relationship, but long-term issues need addressing when they cause significant distress.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while sharing a bed is traditional, it's not a requirement for a healthy relationship. Some couples choose separate beds for various reasons, including health or personal preferences. The author isn't asking to end the relationship but to adjust their living situation to improve their well-being.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for their request, and the fianc\u00e9's resistance might be based on misunderstanding or unmet needs. The right answer here is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
