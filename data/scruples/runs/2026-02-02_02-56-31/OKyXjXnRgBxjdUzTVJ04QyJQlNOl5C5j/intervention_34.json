I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is their sleep habits conflicting. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and watches TV loudly. The user is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has a legitimate need for a good night's sleep, especially since they've been dealing with this for years and have kids. Chronic sleep deprivation can be serious. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the suggestion of separate rooms is a big step and might see it as the relationship becoming more like roommates than a couple.\n\nBut relationships require compromise. If they've been together for 8 years and engaged for a year, you'd expect they've tried various compromises. The fianc\u00e9 does lower the volume sometimes, but not enough. The user's health and well-being are important. If they can't resolve this, separate rooms might be a necessary solution. It's not about being in the wrong, but about addressing a real problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about feeling rejected rather than the issue itself. The user isn't wrong for prioritizing their health. So the answer is B.\n"
