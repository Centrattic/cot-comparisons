I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who suggested sleeping in separate rooms is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who keeps the TV on loud at night, causing the author to have poor sleep. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to change his habits, so the author suggests separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. They have two kids, so sleep deprivation could be affecting their overall well-being and ability to care for the children. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing chronic sleep issues, which can lead to health problems. The author's request seems reasonable for their health and quality of life. However, the fianc\u00e9 is resistant, arguing that they might as well be roommates if they can't share a bed. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the fianc\u00e9 could try earplugs or a white noise machine to help him sleep without the TV. Alternatively, using a baby monitor system to lower the volume after he falls asleep. But the author has tried getting the fianc\u00e9 to lower the volume, and he has only made minor compromises. The author's health and well-being are important, and constant poor sleep can have serious consequences. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should make compromises. However, when one partner's habits are causing significant distress without any flexibility, it's reasonable to seek a solution that prioritizes health. The author isn't asking for a huge change, just a separate room to get necessary rest. The fianc\u00e9's response seems more about the symbolism of sharing a bed rather than addressing the actual problem. \n\nThe author's intention is to improve their sleep, which is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is not malicious but a longstanding habit that hasn't been adjusted despite the partner's consistent complaints. In such cases, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a practical solution. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not understanding the severity of sleep deprivation. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is justified in prioritizing their health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing harm, and the solution is reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
