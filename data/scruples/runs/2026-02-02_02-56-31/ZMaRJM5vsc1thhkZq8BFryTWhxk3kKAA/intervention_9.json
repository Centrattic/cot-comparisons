I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to maintain a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: They met a girl on Tinder, she became very attached even though they hadn't met. He pulled back because he felt scared of her attachment, then after time, they reconnect, she says she loves him, they meet up, and he starts to care more. Now, he's worried about his growing feelings and possibly leading her on while also wanting to experience other relationships before \"the one.\"\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and honesty. In most relationships, especially ones where physical meetings happen and intimacy is involved, there's an expectation of exclusivity. The user isn't explicitly stating whether they told the girl it's exclusive or not. If he hasn't clarified the relationship status, then pursuing others could be seen as misleading. \n\nHe mentions she's still in love with him and he's worried about hurting her if he breaks it off. But if he's not committed to an exclusive relationship, then continuing to engage with her while seeing others isn't fair. The problem is that he's building a connection and then using that as an excuse to not commit, while also not being upfront about his intentions. \n\nAlso, the user's mentality of \"gathering experience\" suggests a pattern of not taking relationships seriously, which could be harmful if the other person is emotionally invested. Even if he doesn't want to cheat, the mere act of maintaining the relationship without being honest about his intentions is where the issue lies. \n\nSo, if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he's not being honest about seeing others, then yes, he's in the wrong. But if they had an open or non-exclusive agreement from the start, then maybe not. However, the user doesn't mention that there was such an agreement. Given the context, it seems like he's keeping her under the impression that it's a serious relationship while secretly planning to pursue others, which is deceitful. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (he's in the wrong).\n"
