  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. They met a girl on Tinder, she became attached, but he pulled back because he was scared. Then later, they reconnected, she confessed love, they met up, and now he's feeling conflicted. He wants to keep her but also wants to date others to gain experience for his future \"one.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user is in a relationship, but he's planning to pursue others before committing. That sounds like cheating unless they've agreed on an open relationship. The question is whether he's being honest and respectful.\n\nThe user says he doesn't want to cheat but feels he might. That's a red flag. If he's not committed, he's leading her on. Also, he's keeping her in the relationship not because he's in love but because he enjoys the experience. Even if he's not cheating yet, his intentions are problematic. He's not being honest about his future plans to stay with her long-term. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should have mutual expectations. By pursuing others, especially without her knowing, he's not being truthful. That's a breach of trust. Even if they're long-distance, his actions suggest he's not serious about her, which is unfair to her.\n\nHe also mentions she's fun but not his future. So he's using her for experience, which is manipulative. The fact that he's considering breaking up later to avoid hurting her now shows he knows it's not a genuine partnership. That's definitely in the wrong.\n\nSo the answer is A. He's in the wrong because he's not being honest and is leading her on while planning to pursue others.\n"
