  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other girls. The main question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, he met the girl online, she became very attached. He was scared and pulled back. Then they reconnected later, she confessed love, and they met up. Now he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown but he doesn't want a serious commitment yet. He wants to keep the relationship going while also meeting other girls, but he's worried about cheating or hurting her.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and honesty. In any relationship, especially one with emotional intimacy, both parties should have clear expectations. If he isn't in a monogamous relationship and hasn't discussed boundaries, then pursuing others could be seen as deceptive. However, if it's an open relationship and both are aware, then it might be different. But the user hasn't mentioned discussing this with the girl. He's concerned about breaking up with her to avoid hurting her, but he's not truthful about his intentions. That lack of communication could be the issue. He's using the girl emotionally without being honest about his long-term plans, which can be seen as manipulative. So, he's in the wrong for not being upfront and for possibly leading her on without her consent to a non-monogamous arrangement.\n"
