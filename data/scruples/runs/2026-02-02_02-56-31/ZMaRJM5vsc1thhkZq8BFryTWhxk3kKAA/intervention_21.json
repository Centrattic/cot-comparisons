  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy met a girl online, and she became very attached. He felt uncomfortable with her attachment and started to distance himself. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she expresses love, and they plan a visit. They spend time together, have a good time, and now he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's worried about being with someone else. His main issue is that he wants to gain experience for a future relationship but doesn't want to hurt this girl.\n\nThe key points here are: Is he in a committed relationship? The user mentions she has a boyfriend at some point, but now she's not with him. The current setup is a long-distance relationship, but the user is also considering pursuing other girls. The user feels that if he breaks up with her now, he might hurt her, but he's not ready for a serious commitment.\n\nThe problem is that he's not being honest with the girl. If he's not committed to a monogamous relationship, then pursuing another person while in a relationship would be considered cheating. But wait, the user says he's not in a relationship. The girl bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his house, and they had intimate moments. But he hasn't committed to being exclusive or being in a relationship. So is this a dating relationship or just a casual one?\n\nIf they are in a relationship, then pursuing others would be cheating. If it's just casual, then maybe not. However, the user has led the girl to believe they are in a relationship because she said she loves him, and he's allowed her to visit. The user might be in the wrong because he's not being upfront about his intentions. He's keeping her on a string, making her believe there's a future when he's not ready to commit. Also, by pursuing others, if they are in a relationship, that's dishonest.\n\nAnother angle: The user is not in a committed relationship, but he's using the girl for experience. That could be seen as using her and not being honest about his intentions. Even if it's casual, if she expects exclusivity and he's not providing that, he's in the wrong. The user should be clear about his boundaries from the start. If he can't be honest and upfront, then he's being a jerk.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The user isn't in a formal relationship, but his actions (accepting her love, planning visits, etc.) have given her the impression of a relationship. Pursuing others without her knowledge would be deceitful. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
