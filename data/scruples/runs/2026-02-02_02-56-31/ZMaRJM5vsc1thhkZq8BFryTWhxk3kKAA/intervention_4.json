  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let's start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the guy met a girl online, and she became very attached. He wasn't sure about his feelings and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she tells him she loves him, and they plan a meet-up. They spend time together, have a good time, and now he's feeling conflicted because he's grown attached but also doesn't think she's his future partner. He wants to keep the relationship going but also doesn't want to cheat, yet feels like he might if he continues. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep her while pursuing others.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy isn't in a committed relationship, he's in a long-distance but hasn't made it exclusive, and he's considering pursuing others. The issue is whether it's wrong to do so. \n\nIn many relationships, especially when it's not defined as monogamous, people have different expectations. If he's not in a committed monogamous relationship, then pursuing other people might not technically be cheating. However, the problem arises if he's leading the girl on or not being honest about his intentions. \n\nThe girl has said she loves him, which is a significant step, and he hasn't reciprocated. That could imply she's emotionally invested while he's not fully committed. If he's planning to pursue others, even if he's not in a monogamous relationship, it's possible that she's expecting exclusivity, which he hasn't communicated. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. If he's keeping her in the loop knowing he might break up later, he might be causing her harm. The user mentions that breaking up would hurt her, but he doesn't want to do that. However, maintaining a relationship without full commitment could be seen as emotionally manipulative, even if not intentionally.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not honest about his intentions and she's under the impression that they're in a monogamous relationship, then yes, he's in the wrong. But if he's clear that it's non-exclusive and she's okay with that, then maybe not. The problem here is that he hasn't clarified this. He's keeping her close while planning to pursue others, which could be seen as deceptive. \n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because he's not being truthful about his intentions and might be leading her on emotionally without a clear understanding of the relationship's boundaries.\n"
