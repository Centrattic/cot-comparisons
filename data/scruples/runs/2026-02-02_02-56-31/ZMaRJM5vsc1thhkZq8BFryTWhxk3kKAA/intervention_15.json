I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy met a girl online, and she became very attached even though they hadn't met. He felt scared and pulled away, but then they reconnected later. She fell in love with him, and they met up, spent time together, and had a good experience. Now, he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure to break up soon because he doesn't want her to be his future soulmate. He also wants to date other girls to gain experience for when he meets \"the one.\"\n\nThe key points here are honesty and communication. If he's not in a committed, exclusive relationship, maybe it's not cheating. But the problem is that he's in a relationship where she has feelings for him, and he's considering being with others. Even if he's not cheating, the ethical issue is whether he's being transparent. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he's pursuing others, that's a problem. But if it's casual or open, maybe not.\n\nWait, in the original post, he says he's not in the wrong, but he's worried about breaking her heart. However, by pursuing other girls, he's not respecting her feelings if she expects exclusivity. He hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries. So, if the relationship is exclusive, he's in the wrong. If not, maybe not. But since she's the one who declared her love, and he's not reciprocating, that might mean he's not committed. However, by continuing the relationship, he's leading her on. It's possible he's emotionally manipulating her, not being honest about his intentions. That would make him the asshole. So answer A.\n"
