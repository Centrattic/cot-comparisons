I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship where the guy is maintaining it while also considering pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the key points: The man started a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He gave her the cold shoulder, but after some time, they reconnect, she says she loves him, and they meet up. Now, he's feeling conflicted because he's growing attached but doesn't want a long-term commitment. He's worried about not wanting to hurt her if he breaks up with her but also doesn't want to commit fully. He wants to keep the relationship while exploring others, which he's trying to rationalize as gaining experience for his future.\n\nNow, the ethical question here is about honesty and emotional harm. The author is in a relationship where the other person has expressed love and commitment, but he's not ready to reciprocate fully. By continuing the relationship while planning to pursue others, he's being deceptive. Even if he doesn't physically cheat, emotional infidelity can still hurt the other person. The girl has invested emotionally, and he's using her to gain experience for a future relationship, which is selfish. He's also aware that breaking up might hurt her, but he's choosing to avoid that by not being honest about his intentions. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships require mutual understanding and consent. If he's not willing to commit and is planning to look for others, he should be honest with her. Keeping her in the dark while pursuing others is unethical. The author is in the wrong because he's not being truthful and is using her emotionally without her knowledge. So the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
