  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship with a girl while also pursuing other girls. They met the girl online, had a lot of back and forth, and now they're meeting up. They feel their feelings are growing but are worried about the future. They want to get experience with other girls before settling down. \n\nFirst, the main issue here is the dynamics of their relationship. The girl is very attached, and the user is afraid of hurting her if they break up now. But they're considering keeping the relationship while also dating others. That sounds like emotional cheating. Even if they don't have physical relationships with others, pursuing other girls while in a committed (even if not formally) relationship is a red flag.\n\nThe user hasn't even confirmed if the girl is in a relationship when they reconnected. She had a boyfriend before, but maybe not now. They also mention she's staying in his room, which is intimate. So there's a level of exclusivity here. If they're having a romantic relationship, then pursuing others would be cheating. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that they don't want to \"ruin her\" by breaking up now, but they also don't see her as the future. That's selfish. The girl deserves honesty. If they're not ready to commit, they should communicate that. It's not fair to keep her in a situation where she's emotionally invested and not honest about their intentions. \n\nThey mention wanting to get experience before the \"one,\" but that's a common excuse for not taking responsibility. The girl might not be their \"one,\" but she's a person with feelings. The user is using her while avoiding commitment, which is wrong. They should consider if the girl would feel okay if she found out they were with others. If not, then they are in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is probably A (they're in the wrong). They're being dishonest and emotionally manipulative. Even if they're not physically cheating, the emotional aspect is cheating. They need to be upfront about their intentions or break up respectfully.\n"
