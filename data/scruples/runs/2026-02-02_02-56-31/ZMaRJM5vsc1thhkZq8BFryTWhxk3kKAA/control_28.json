I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the provided situation. The author is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current one. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author started a relationship with a girl they met on Tinder. She became very attached even though they hadn't met. The author was scared and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she expresses love, but the author can't reciprocate. They plan a meeting, spend three days together, and the author now feels conflicted because they don't want to commit but also don't want to hurt her.\n\nThe main issue is whether it's wrong to continue the relationship while pursuing others. The author's reasoning is that they want to gain experience for their future soulmate, but they don't want to cheat. However, pursuing other girls while in a relationship (even if it's long-distance) might be considered emotionally dishonest. The author is using the girl's feelings without being fully committed, which could lead to emotional harm if they break up later. \n\nAlso, the author hasn't been honest about their intentions from the start. If they're not looking for a committed relationship, they should have communicated that. By letting the girl believe there's potential for more while they're actually not sure, they might be leading her on. The fact that the author is planning to break up eventually suggests a lack of commitment, which is a red flag. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, maintaining a relationship with the intent to also pursue others is generally considered wrong because it's not transparent and can cause emotional harm. Even if the author doesn't cheat, the emotional investment from the girl might make her feel used or manipulated if the relationship ends. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
