  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other women, even though they don't want to cheat. They mentioned that the girl in question is very affectionate and has deep feelings, but they're still not sure if they can commit. The key points here are the long-distance nature, the emotional investment from the other person, and the user's desire to explore other relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. If the user hasn't been honest about their intentions from the start, that's a problem. They might be leading her on without clear communication. They also mentioned that after meeting, their feelings grew, but they're still unsure about commitment. That could mean they're not being upfront about their own feelings and future plans, potentially causing emotional harm.\n\nThen there's the aspect of pursuing other women. If they're in a relationship, even a long-distance one, pursuing others without being clear about the relationship status is generally considered wrong. However, if the relationship isn't exclusive or hasn't been defined as such, the ethical lines might be different. The user hasn't mentioned whether they've set boundaries, which is crucial in long-distance relationships where communication is key.\n\nAlso, the user's reasoning about wanting to gain experience before the \"right\" person might be a justification for avoiding commitment. But if they're not honest with the current partner about their intentions, that's a red flag. The user is in a position where they're benefiting from the emotional connection without being fully committed, which can be exploitative.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for hurting the girl if they break up. But the user also says they don't want to break up, which creates a conflict. They might be using the excuse of needing time to avoid making a difficult decision, which isn't fair to the girl who is emotionally invested.\n\nIn terms of cheating, the user says they don't want to cheat but feel they might. That's a sign of inner conflict and possible lack of self-awareness. If they're not committed and are emotionally invested, it's challenging to maintain a healthy dynamic without causing harm.\n\nIn summary, the main issues are lack of clear communication about relationship status, emotional manipulation, and potential for emotional harm. The user is likely in the wrong because they're not being transparent and are keeping someone in a situation where they might get hurt later. They need to have an honest conversation to set boundaries or decide to end the relationship if they can't commit.\n"
