  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They've been talking for a year, met up recently, and she's really into him. He feels pressured because he doesn't want a serious relationship yet but enjoys her company. He also wants to pursue other girls without cheating. The question is whether he's in the wrong for continuing the relationship while looking for others.\n\nFirst, infidelity is a big issue. The user says he doesn't want to cheat, but he's considering pursuing other girls. If the relationship is exclusive, even if not formally stated, pursuing others could be seen as a betrayal. But maybe they haven't defined the relationship's boundaries. If it's not exclusive, then it's different. But the user feels pressured to break up because he doesn't want a future with her. \n\nHe mentions he's in a long-distance situation, which can be challenging. He's worried about his feelings growing when they're apart and possibly breaking up later. The key here is communication. If he hasn't been honest about his intentions from the start, that's a problem. He started the relationship knowing he wasn't committed, and now he's unsure if he's leading her on. \n\nAlso, she's bought a train ticket and stayed in his room, which suggests a level of commitment. If he's not ready to be in a committed relationship, continuing while pursuing others could be seen as manipulative or unfair to her. The user's reasoning is that he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up now, but he's not giving her honest information about his intentions. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the relationship isn't exclusive, there's a problem. If it is, then pursuing others is cheating. Even if it's not explicit, the user's actions might be leading her to believe more than he's willing to give. The fact that he's planning to break up in the future but hasn't told her yet is a red flag. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the relationship is exclusive and if he communicated his intentions. Since he hasn't mentioned this to her, and she's invested, he's likely in the wrong for not being honest and possibly leading her on. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
