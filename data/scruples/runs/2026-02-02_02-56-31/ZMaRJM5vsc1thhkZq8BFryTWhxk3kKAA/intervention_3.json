  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They haven't met in person until recently when she visited him. After meeting, he feels his feelings have grown, but he's also hesitant because he doesn't want a long-term commitment yet. He's considering pursuing other relationships but doesn't want to break up with her because he thinks it would hurt her.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is honesty and communication. In any relationship, whether it's long-distance or not, both parties should have clear expectations. If he's not in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others isn't inherently wrong if it's agreed upon. However, if the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust.\n\nThe user mentions that he hasn't explicitly defined the relationship yet. They met online, had a lot of interaction, met in person, and had a romantic visit. But he hasn't communicated his intentions clearly. He's holding on because he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's also not being honest about his desire to explore other relationships. This lack of communication is a problem because it sets the stage for potential heartbreak. If she believes they're in a monogamous relationship and he's not honest about his intentions, that's a betrayal.\n\nAnother point is his fear of commitment. He's using the excuse that he's not ready for a long-term relationship and wants to gain experience. While that's his personal reasoning, the ethical issue lies in whether he's being transparent with her. If he's not willing to be monogamous, he should have discussed that upfront. Continuing the relationship under the pretense of exclusivity while planning to pursue others is misleading.\n\nHe also mentions that she still has a boyfriend somewhere in the timeline. Wait, earlier he said she had a boyfriend during the ten months, but now after reconnecting, he's with her. So maybe she was in a relationship when they first connected, then became single. But now they're in a relationship? Or is he in a relationship with her despite her previous partner? The timeline is a bit confusing. However, the main point is that if he's aware she was in a relationship earlier, but now they're seeing each other, that's resolved.\n\nBut the current issue is his intention to pursue others while in a relationship with her. If the relationship is monogamous and he's not honest about that, then yes, he's in the wrong. If the relationship is non-exclusive and both parties are aware, then it's a different scenario. However, the user hasn't clarified this with her. He's making decisions without her knowledge, which is the core of the problem.\n\nHe also mentions that he's afraid breaking up now would hurt her. But staying in the relationship under false pretenses is also harmful. It's better to be honest, even if it's painful in the short term, to avoid causing more pain later. By not being upfront about his intentions, he's setting her up for potential heartbreak when she realizes he's not committed to a monogamous relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the user hasn't communicated his intentions clearly. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he's planning to pursue others, he's being dishonest. That makes him the asshole. If the relationship is non-exclusive, then it's different, but since he hasn't discussed it, he's still in the wrong for not being transparent. The answer is A.\n"
