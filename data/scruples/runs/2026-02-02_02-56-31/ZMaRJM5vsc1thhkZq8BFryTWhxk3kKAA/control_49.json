I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author met a girl online, they had a connection but he was afraid of her getting too attached. He gave her the cold shoulder, then after some time, they reconnect and she ends up loving him. They meet, have a nice time, and he's now conflicted because he's grown attached but doesn't want to commit fully. He's thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience for his future \"one,\" but he doesn't want to cheat.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. But the original question is whether he's in the wrong. The author mentions he hasn't committed to her, and he's not sure about his feelings. However, he's planning to be in a committed future with someone else. \n\nWait, but the problem here is that if he's in a relationship with her, even if it's long-distance and not officially defined, he's being unfaithful by pursuing others. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The user might be considering if it's okay to not be exclusive if neither party has set boundaries. \n\nHowever, in most relationships, even long-distance, there's an expectation of monogamy unless otherwise agreed. If the author is actively pursuing other girls while being with her, that's a breach of trust. The fact that he's planning to meet her again and spend time with her suggests he's in a relationship, even if it's not formalized. \n\nAdditionally, he's keeping her at a distance emotionally to avoid commitment, then getting involved with her, which could be seen as manipulative. He's aware that she's emotionally invested and he's not reciprocating fully, yet continues the relationship. \n\nSo, even if he's not explicitly cheating yet, his intention to pursue others while being in a romantic relationship with her is problematic. The \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) part hinges on whether his actions are deceitful or exploitative. Since he's using her for experience while not being honest about his intentions, he's in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
