I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is 22, in a long-distance relationship where they met online, and after reconnecting, the girl expressed love, but the author didn't reciprocate. They're now worried about growing feelings and the pressure of being in a relationship but also want to explore other relationships without cheating. The key points are the existing relationship's status, the author's intentions, and the ethical implications of their actions.\n\nFirst, the relationship seems to be an ongoing one, even if it's long-distance. The author mentions that the girl bought a train ticket to visit, they were intimate, and there's a plan to meet again. The author's hesitation to say they love her but still continuing the relationship might indicate some level of commitment, even if not fully reciprocal. \n\nThe author's main conflict is about pursuing other relationships while in this one. The question is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship with someone and also seek other partners. The ethical aspect here hinges on whether the current relationship is monogamous. If the relationship is monogamous and the author is pursuing others without the partner's knowledge or consent, that would be cheating, making them in the wrong. However, if the relationship is non-monogamous or open, then it's different. The post doesn't mention any prior agreement about exclusivity, so it's likely expected to be monogamous.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions not wanting to hurt the girl by breaking up, which shows some consideration, but they're still considering continuing the relationship while pursuing others. This creates a situation where they're potentially leading the girl on if they can't commit, which could be seen as emotionally manipulative. The author's own reasoning that \"I want to gain experience before the right one\" suggests they're not ready for a serious, committed relationship, which might not be the girl's expectation.\n\nThe key issue here is honesty and mutual expectations. If the author is not being truthful about their intentions and is engaging in behavior that could harm the girl's feelings, they are acting unethically. The fact that the girl expressed love and the author didn't reciprocate but still continued the relationship may already be problematic. Adding pursuit of other girls without her knowledge would exacerbate the problem.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they are maintaining a relationship under potentially misleading terms and engaging in behavior that could harm the girl emotionally, without her consent or knowledge. This makes the answer A.\n"
