  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met until recently, and after a visit, his feelings have grown. But he's also thinking about pursuing other girls, not wanting to commit yet, fearing he might cheat. He's worried about hurting her if he breaks up now but doesn't want to be in a serious relationship.\n\nFirst, he's in a committed relationship, right? Even if it's long-distance, if they're in a monogamous agreement, then pursuing others is a problem. But wait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key issue here is whether he's being honest about his intentions. He mentioned that he doesn't want to commit and is planning to pursue others, which implies he's not in a monogamous relationship. But if he's leading her on, that's where the problem lies. \n\nHe initially gave her a cold shoulder because he was scared she'd fall for him, but then continued the relationship. Now, after getting close, he's conflicted. The fact that he's considering breaking up later might suggest he's not ready for a serious commitment. But if he's already in a relationship with her and plans to see other people, that's infidelity. Unless the relationship is non-monogamous, which he hasn't mentioned. So assuming it's monogamous, he's in the wrong because he's not being truthful about his intentions and is putting her in a position where she's emotionally invested without his commitment. \n\nAlso, he felt pressured to reciprocate her feelings but didn't, yet continued the relationship. That could be emotionally manipulative. The answer is probably A (he's in the wrong) because he's not honest and is using her while planning to pursue others, which is dishonest and harmful.\n"
