I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the long distance relationship scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down what's happening here.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old guy in a long distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They never met initially but became close through texting. He was scared of her attachment and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she says she loves him, and they plan a visit. After meeting, he's more attached but also feels pressured and doesn't want to commit fully. His reasoning is that he wants to gain experience with other girls so he doesn't mess up with \"the one.\" \n\nSo, the main issue is whether keeping the relationship while pursuing others is wrong. From what I understand, having a committed relationship and being with other people is generally considered cheating or at least being disingenuous. The author hasn't explicitly stated that he's in a monogamous relationship, though. He mentions he didn't say he loved her back, but they're planning visits and sharing intimate moments. Even if it's not a formal commitment, the girl has expressed love, and he's leading her on by not reciprocating that feeling and possibly pursuing others. \n\nThe key points here are the girl's emotional investment versus the author's intentions. If he's not committed to her and is using the relationship as a way to gain experience while planning to see others, that's being unfair. The girl might believe there's exclusivity, especially after the visit and the planned future meetings. The author's fear of commitment and desire to avoid \"cheating\" by pursuing others while staying with her is a conflict. Even if he's not physically cheating, emotionally, he's not being honest about his intentions. \n\nSo, the question is about consent and communication. If the relationship isn't monogamous by agreement, technically he might not be cheating, but he's still not being transparent about his intentions. The girl might feel misled if she believes they're in a real relationship while he's seeing others. The author's rationale that he wants to avoid cheating by \"pursuing other girls\" sounds like an excuse to maintain the status quo without taking responsibility for his actions. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, honesty and transparency in relationships are crucial. The author is creating emotional attachment in the girl without being truthful about his own feelings and future plans. That's exploitative. Even if he doesn't see it as cheating, the girl is likely feeling that she's in a relationship where exclusivity is implied. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest and is using the relationship for his own gain without considering the girl's feelings.\n"
