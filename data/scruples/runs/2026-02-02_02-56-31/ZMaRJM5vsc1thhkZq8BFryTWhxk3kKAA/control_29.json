I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 22 and has a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met until recently, and after a long period of on-again, off-again communication, they finally met in person. She bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his shared house, and had an intimate experience. Now, the author is conflicted because his feelings for her have grown, but he doesn't see her as a future partner. He wants to continue the relationship for fun but also feels the need to pursue other girls, not wanting to commit yet. The main issue here is whether he's being dishonest or manipulative by not being upfront about his intentions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author hasn't committed to a monogamous relationship. When they met, he didn't say it was exclusive, and he's now considering pursuing other relationships. The problem is if he's leading her on without her knowing his intentions. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive but he's pursuing others without telling her, that would be a problem. However, if the relationship isn't exclusive from the start, maybe it's not the same.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that when she said she loves him, he didn't reciprocate but explained why. He also says he doesn't want to break up because she's fun. However, his goal is to gain experience for a future serious relationship. This implies that he might not be honest about his intentions, which could be emotionally manipulative. If she's in a committed headspace, even if it's long-distance, and he's not, that's a mismatch.\n\nAlso, he's planning to pursue other girls while in this relationship. That's a red flag if it's supposed to be monogamous. The question is whether the author is being truthful. If he hasn't clarified the relationship's status, he's being deceptive. The user might think that even in a long-distance, if there's mutual understanding of exclusivity, pursuing others is cheating. However, if it's not exclusive, then it's a different scenario. The author hasn't specified, but the way he's acting suggests he's not being up front.\n\nAnother angle: the girl bought a ticket to visit him, invested time and money. If he's not serious, he's using her for his own needs without considering her feelings. The author is aware that breaking up would hurt her but chooses not to, which could be seen as selfish. Even if he's not in a committed relationship yet, continuing without honesty is leading her on.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not honest about his intentions and is leading her to believe there's a future when he's only looking for casual, then yes. The key is whether he's being deceptive. The answer would hinge on the presence of deception and emotional manipulation. Since the author is considering pursuing others while in this relationship without her knowledge, that's a breach of trust, hence he's in the wrong.\n"
