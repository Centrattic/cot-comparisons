I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the author is maintaining it while also pursuing other girls.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met a girl online, they had a long-distance relationship, met in person, had a good time, and she's very affectionate. The author is now worried about growing feelings and not wanting to commit long-term. He also mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls to prepare for a future \"soulmate,\" but he doesn't want to cheat. The main question is if it's wrong to keep the relationship going while also seeing others.\n\nThe author hasn't explicitly said he's in a monogamous relationship. The original post says she's been his girlfriend for a year, but he's not sure if she's his future partner. However, when they met, he didn't end the relationship but instead continued. The fact that he's considering pursuing other girls while maintaining this relationship could be an issue if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive. \n\nIf the relationship isn't monogamous, then maybe it's okay. But if it's supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be cheating, making him the asshole. The key here is whether the boundaries are set. The author hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries with his partner. She's been very attached, and he's been avoiding commitment. Now, he's considering moving on after some time without breaking her heart.\n\nHe's trying to balance his desire for experience with not wanting to hurt her. But the problem is that if he's not upfront about his intentions and continues to see others, that's deceitful. Even if he plans to break up later, leading her on while seeing others is dishonest and could be considered emotionally manipulative. \n\nThe author's reasoning that he's doing it to prepare for a future partner doesn't justify the current actions. Relationships require mutual understanding and consent. Without her knowing he's seeing others, he's violating trust. Even if he's not physically cheating, emotionally, he's being unfaithful if the relationship is exclusive. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he's maintaining a relationship under potentially false pretenses, without transparency, and is planning to pursue others, which could hurt her. The fact that he's considering breaking up later doesn't absolve the current behavior of being deceptive.\n"
