  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other relationships. First, they met a girl online, and she became very attached quickly. They had a connection, met in person, and she expressed love, but he couldn't reciprocate. They planned visits and had a good time, but he's now worried about his growing feelings and the pressure to commit. His main issue is wanting to keep this relationship while also exploring others, fearing he might cheat if he doesn't.\n\nThe key points here are honesty and boundaries. In any relationship, whether long-distance or not, communication is crucial. If the user isn't emotionally committed and is considering other partners, he needs to be upfront about that. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust, making him at fault. However, if both parties agreed it's non-exclusive, then it's different. But the user didn't mention discussing this, so it's likely assumed to be exclusive. The girl's emotional investment and his hesitation to commit might be causing her pain if he later breaks up. Also, his reasoning about gaining experience for future relationships doesn't excuse dishonesty or potential emotional harm. So, the answer would be A (he's at fault) because he's not being transparent and may be leading her on.\n"
