I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is in a long-distance relationship and is considering pursuing other girls. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author met the girl online a year ago, and she became very attached. He pulled back because he felt she was too affectionate. Then, after some time, they reconnected, and she ended up visiting him, staying in his house, sharing intimate moments. Now, he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure, leading him to consider other relationships to gain experience before a \"real\" one.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of their relationship. When they reconnected, did they define their relationship? The author mentions they planned to meet and had a three-day visit. If they considered themselves a couple, then pursuing others would be cheating. But if it was casual or undefined, maybe not. However, the girl expressed love, which might imply a more committed stance. The author didn't reciprocate but didn't clarify boundaries either. \n\nThe author's intention to pursue other girls while maintaining this relationship could be problematic. If they're in a monogamous relationship, that's a clear breach. But if it's a casual or open arrangement, it might be different. The author's fear of commitment and wanting experience before \"the one\" shows he's not ready for a serious relationship. However, if the other girl isn't aware of this, he's misleading her. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship is monogamous and he's planning to be with others, then yes. If it's not defined, maybe not, but still ethically questionable. The fact that she's investing emotionally and he's not reciprocating fully could be seen as using her. The author's plan to pursue others while keeping her around might be manipulative, regardless of his intentions. So, the answer would depend on the relationship's nature. Since the girl expressed love and he didn't clarify his stance, he's at least being deceptive. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
