  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've been talking for a while, met up recently, and he's developed stronger feelings. But he's also thinking about pursuing other girls because his approach is to gain experience for the future. He's worried about cheating if he continues the current relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether he's being honest with the girl. He mentioned she told him she loves him, but he didn't reciprocate. Now he's considering pursuing others while in a serious situation. Even if it's a long-distance, if he's not committed to her and is planning to pursue others, that's a problem. The key issue here is consent and honesty. If he's not upfront about his intentions, he's leading her on. \n\nHe also bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, and they had intimate experiences. She's emotionally invested, and he's now conflicted because he doesn't see her as a future partner but doesn't want to hurt her. That's a classic case of being in a relationship without being honest about one's intentions. \n\nThe user's justification is that he's exploring to prepare for a future \"right\" relationship. But that's not a valid excuse. If he's in a relationship, even a casual one, he has a responsibility to be truthful. Pursuing others while in a relationship is generally considered a breach of trust. Unless it's an open relationship where all parties agree, which isn't mentioned here, it's unethical. \n\nHe's also concerned about breaking up with her now, but that's his problem, not hers. It's his responsibility to communicate his lack of commitment before things go too far. By not being honest from the start, he's putting her in a position where she's emotionally invested without knowing his true intentions. \n\nSo, the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's being dishonest and is using the girl while planning to pursue others. It's not just about cheating; it's about the emotional manipulation and lack of transparency.\n"
