  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other girls. Let me start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the user and the girl met online, and she became very attached. He felt scared of her affection and pulled away, which caused the relationship to dwindle. Then, after ten months, they reconnected, met up, and things got serious. Now, he's afraid of getting too emotionally involved and doesn't want to commit to her because he doesn't see her as his future partner. Instead, he wants to gain experience with other girls before settling down with someone he considers \"the one.\"\n\nThe user is asking if it's wrong to maintain the relationship while pursuing others. The main ethical question here is about honesty and commitment. If the user isn't committed to her and is open to being with others, that's a problem because it's not a monogamous relationship. However, if the relationship is already non-exclusive or she's aware he's open to others, maybe it's okay. But since he hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries, it's likely she expects exclusivity. \n\nAlso, the user's fear of hurting her by breaking up now suggests he's not being upfront about his intentions. He's using her for experience, which can be seen as selfish. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and clear communication. If he's not ready to commit and isn't honest about his intentions, he's misleading her. \n\nAnother point is the emotional impact. She's invested a lot, and if he's not, he's putting her in a vulnerable position. Even if he doesn't want to hurt her, continuing the relationship under false pretenses is dishonest. It's better to be honest and set clear expectations from the start. \n\nHe also mentions not wanting to cheat but fearing he might. This indicates a lack of self-awareness and responsibility. If he's not in a committed relationship, he's not cheating, but if he's in a relationship that's supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be cheating. The key here is understanding the nature of their agreement. If it's not a monogamous relationship, then it's a matter of their mutual understanding. But if it's implied exclusivity, then he's in the wrong. \n\nThe user's approach of wanting to \"get experience\" for the future partner could be valid if both parties are okay with it. However, without clear communication and consent, it's problematic. The girl might believe she's in a serious relationship, and his intentions could lead to emotional harm if things don't go as planned. \n\nIn summary, the core issue is honesty and transparency. If the user isn't upfront about his intentions to pursue others, he's misleading her. Even if the relationship isn't exclusive, the lack of communication about boundaries can lead to misunderstandings and hurt. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially using the relationship for personal gain without considering her feelings.\n"
