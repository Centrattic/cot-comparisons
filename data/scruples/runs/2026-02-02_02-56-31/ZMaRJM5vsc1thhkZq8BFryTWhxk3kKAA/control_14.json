I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is 22 and got into a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. Initially, she became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He then gave her the cold shoulder but didn't cut off the connection. Later, after some time, they reconnected, and she confessed her love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. They ended up meeting, had a good time, and now he's feeling conflicted. He's worried about growing more attached and doesn't want to commit, so he's considering pursuing other girls while keeping this relationship.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and commitment. In most relationships, whether long-distance or not, there's an expectation of exclusivity if it's considered a romantic relationship. The author didn't explicitly define the relationship's boundaries. He might have given signals that it's exclusive, but if he's planning to pursue others, that's deceitful. However, if the relationship was casual from the start, maybe it's different.\n\nThe problem arises if the girl believes the relationship is monogamous, and the author is not being transparent about his intentions. The author mentions he's not interested in a future with her but enjoys the experience. If he's leading her on without being honest, that's the issue. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to be with her while also seeing others. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then maybe not. But if there's an unspoken expectation of exclusivity, then he is.\n\nThe author's plan to break up later to avoid hurting her now is also problematic. It's better to be honest upfront rather than prolonging something that's not genuine. His justification that he wants experience for a future partner doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to be truthful now. So, the answer leans towards A, he's in the wrong for not being upfront and for potentially leading her on.\n"
