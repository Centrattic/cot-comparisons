  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: He's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They haven't met until recently. After meeting, he feels his feelings for her have grown, but he's also still interested in other girls. His main concern is that he doesn't want to cheat but feels like he might if he continues the relationship. He's worried about breaking her heart if he ends things now.\n\nSo, the key points here. The user is in a committed relationship, even if it's not officially labeled as such. They've met, had intimate moments, and there's a plan for future visits. If he's in a relationship, pursuing other girls would typically be considered a breach of trust. Even if the relationship isn't formalized, if both parties are in a committed LDR, then pursuing others could be seen as cheating. \n\nHe mentions he doesn't want to cheat but feels he might if he continues. That suggests he's aware of the potential issue. Also, he's conflicted because he doesn't want to hurt her but isn't sure if he can commit. The user's mindset about wanting to gain experience for his future \"soulmate\" is problematic because it implies he's using her for practice, which isn't respectful.\n\nAnother angle: The girl is clearly very invested. She's traveled to see him, bought tickets, and expressed her feelings. If he's not fully committed, that's a form of emotional manipulation. Even if he's not in a formal relationship, his actions and the depth of their connection could make this a de facto relationship, where exclusivity is expected.\n\nThe user might argue that he's not in a committed relationship yet, so it's okay. But the reality is that long-distance relationships often involve some level of exclusivity. If he's not willing to be exclusive, that's a problem. Plus, his intention to pursue others while being in a LDR with someone who's clearly attached is a breach of trust and could be considered the wrong thing to do.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A: Yes, he's in the wrong. He's leading her on, not being honest about his intentions, and putting her in a position where she's emotionally invested while he's planning to see others. That's not fair or respectful, especially since he's aware of her feelings and his own potential to hurt her.\n"
