  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and also pursuing other girls. They met this girl online, had a connection, met up, and things were good. But they're scared that their feelings might grow more, which could lead to a breakup that would hurt her. They also want to gain experience with other girls before finding the \"right one.\" The big question is whether it's wrong to keep the relationship going while seeing others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user isn't in a committed monogamous relationship. They mentioned it's a long-distance situation, which can be tricky because of the physical separation. They had a boyfriend break up at some point, but the user didn't know that when they reconnected. Now they're together again, but the user is feeling conflicted about their own feelings and future intentions.\n\nThe main ethical issue here is about honesty and emotional manipulation. If the user is leading this girl on without intending to be in a monogamous relationship, that's a problem. Even if they aren't \"cheating\" in the traditional sense (since they haven't been in a formal agreement about exclusivity), they're creating an emotional bond without being upfront about their intentions. The user's goal is to gain experience with multiple partners before committing, which might not align with the girl's needs for a more serious relationship.\n\nAlso, the user is planning to see her again in the future, which gives her hope for a lasting relationship. If the user isn't planning to be exclusive or long-term with her, then continuing the relationship while pursuing others could be seen as using her for emotional and physical satisfaction without genuine commitment. This could hurt her when the user eventually decides to move on.\n\nAnother angle is the user's fear of hurting her by breaking up. The user might be using this as a reason to avoid the responsibility of being honest. It's important to ask if the user is treating this girl's feelings as valid. If the user isn't ready to be exclusive, they should communicate that clearly, even if it's uncomfortable. Otherwise, they're setting her up for potential heartbreak later.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: the user hasn't been transparent about their intentions, is leading the girl on with plans for future meetings, and is using the relationship to gain experience while seeing others. These actions can be considered emotionally manipulative and inconsiderate of her feelings. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because they're not being honest and are potentially using her for their own agenda without considering the impact on her.\n"
