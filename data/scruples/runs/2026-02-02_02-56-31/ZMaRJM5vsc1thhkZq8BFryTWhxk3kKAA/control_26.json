I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is in a long-distance relationship and is considering pursuing other girls. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl online, and she became very attached to him even though they hadn't met. He felt uncomfortable with her attachment and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after some time, they reconnected, she bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, had sex, and she told him she loves him. He didn't return the love but explained why. They're planning to meet again, but he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure. He also mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls to avoid messing up with his future soulmate. The question is if he's in the wrong for maintaining the long-distance relationship while pursuing others.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether it's ethical to be in a relationship and pursue others. The author hasn't explicitly said he's in a monogamous relationship, but the context suggests it's a romantic relationship where she's invested, even if he's not fully. Since she's in love with him and he's not returning the love, but is still involved with her, while also considering others, this could be seen as manipulative or emotionally dishonest.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being transparent. If he's not in an exclusive relationship, maybe it's okay, but since she's visiting him, staying in his room, and he's planning to see her again, it seems like a real relationship. The fact that he's not honest about his intentions and is planning to pursue others while keeping her could hurt her. The author might be leading her on, which is typically considered wrong because it can cause emotional harm. He also mentions not wanting to break up with her now because it would hurt her, implying he's already invested in maintaining the relationship for his own enjoyment, which is selfish.\n\nThe author's justification is about gaining experience for the future, but this is a common excuse for not committing. The situation resembles emotional cheating if he's not upfront about his intentions. Since the other girl is invested and he's not, he's not being truthful, which is a problem. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
