I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while staying in the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy met a girl on Tinder a year ago. She became very attached, but he pulled away because he was scared of her falling in love. Now, after some time, he reconnects with her, they meet up, have a good time, and she says she loves him. He hasn't returned the love but they're planning future visits. \n\nThe key issue here is whether maintaining the relationship while pursuing others is wrong. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for wanting to keep the relationship but also looking for others. The author mentions he doesn't want to cheat but feels he might have to if he continues this. \n\nSo, in a relationship where both parties aren't in a monogamous agreement, pursuing others is typically considered cheating. The author is in a long-distance relationship, but there's no mention of whether they've discussed boundaries. The girl is very attached and has feelings for him, which he hasn't reciprocated fully. If he's planning to pursue others while being in this relationship, that's likely a breach of trust and emotional commitment.\n\nAlso, the author is aware that breaking up would hurt her, but he doesn't want to do that. Instead, he wants time to pass for things to cool down. However, by pursuing other relationships during that time, he's not being honest. Even if he doesn't physically cheat, emotionally being involved with others while in a relationship is deceitful.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's gathering experience for a future relationship. But that's a common excuse for not committing. Relationships require honesty and mutual respect. If the girl believes they're in a committed relationship, then the author's actions are unethical because he's not being transparent about his intentions.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A (Yes) because the author is being dishonest and is potentially leading the girl on while planning to pursue others. This is not fair to her and undermines the trust and emotional investment she has in the relationship.\n"
