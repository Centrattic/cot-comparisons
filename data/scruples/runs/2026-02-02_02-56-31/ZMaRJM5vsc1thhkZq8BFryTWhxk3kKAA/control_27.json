I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 22 and met a girl on Tinder a year ago. They had a long-distance relationship where he initially pulled away due to fear of her attachment. After a while, they reconnected, met up, had a great time, and she expressed her love. He didn't reciprocate but stayed in the relationship. Now, he's feeling conflicted because he's considering pursuing other girls to gain experience for a future partner, but doesn't want to cheat. He's worried about breaking up with her and hurting her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is the author being dishonest or deceptive? Are his actions potentially harmful? Was there any form of non-monogamy discussed? The user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for wanting to keep the relationship while seeing others. \n\nThe author mentions he's not cheating yet but has the intention to pursue other girls. If the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust, even if he hasn't acted on it yet. The problem here is that he's not upfront with her about his intentions. He's maintaining a relationship where he's emotionally invested but has plans to be unfaithful. That's a classic case of being in the wrong because it's dishonest and could lead to emotional harm.\n\nAlso, he's aware that if he breaks up, it would hurt her, but he's not willing to commit. It sounds like he's using her for companionship and emotional connection without the intention of being exclusive or committed, which can be considered emotionally manipulative. The fact that he's keeping her in the dark about his plans to see others is a red flag. Even if he hasn't acted on it, the intention is there, and that's where the issue lies.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is likely leading her on, which can cause emotional harm.\n"
