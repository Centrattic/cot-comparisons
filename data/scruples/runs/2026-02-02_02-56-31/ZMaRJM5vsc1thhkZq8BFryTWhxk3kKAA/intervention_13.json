  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other girls. The key points here are communication and honesty.\n\nFirst, the relationship started via Tinder, which is typically casual. But the girl became very attached, and they had a physical meeting. The user now feels conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's also not ready for a serious commitment and wants to explore other relationships. \n\nThe user mentions he doesn't want to be in a commitment yet and is using the experience as preparation for future relationships. However, the girl is clearly invested, as shown by her expressing love and buying a train ticket to visit. The user hasn't communicated his intentions to pursue others, which is a red flag. \n\nIn a relationship, even if it's not labeled as exclusive, honesty about one's intentions is crucial. If the user is okay with being in a non-exclusive relationship, he should discuss that with her. But if he's not upfront and continues to lead her on, that's where the problem lies. The fact that he's keeping her in his room and sharing intimate moments while planning long-term visits suggests a level of commitment that might not align with his current intentions. \n\nAlso, the user's approach of wanting to let time pass before breaking up could be seen as using the relationship as a way to avoid confrontation. The girl has the right to know if the user isn't in it for the long term. So, if the user is planning to pursue others while maintaining this relationship without her knowledge, that's being dishonest and could be considered the wrong approach. \n\nTherefore, the answer hinges on whether the user is being transparent about his intentions. If he's not, then yes, he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
