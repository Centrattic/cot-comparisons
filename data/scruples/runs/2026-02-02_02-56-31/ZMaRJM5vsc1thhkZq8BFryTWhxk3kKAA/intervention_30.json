  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met in person until recently, and now he's considering pursuing other girls while keeping the current relationship. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to maintain the long-distance relationship and also dating others.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the girl became very attached to him, which made him uncomfortable. He later gave her the cold shoulder because he feared she might fall in love. Then, after reconnecting, she told him she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate. They planned a meetup, had a good time, and now he's feeling conflicted about his growing feelings and not wanting to commit long-term. Additionally, he wants to continue pursuing other girls but doesn't want to cheat.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. Honesty in relationships: The user didn't reciprocate her love initially and is now considering not being fully committed. Is that honest?\n2. Emotional manipulation: By not breaking up and keeping her engaged, he might be leading her on emotionally.\n3. Intentions: He admits he doesn't see her as his future partner but still keeps her involved, which could be seen as using her.\n4. Other relationships: He wants to pursue other girls, which could be a form of cheating if not openly discussed with her.\n\nThe user's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because he's keeping the girl in a state of uncertainty, possibly hurting her feelings if the relationship ends later. Even if he's not in a formal committed relationship, the emotional investment from her side suggests he has a responsibility to be clear about his intentions. If he's not willing to commit and is planning to pursue others, he should consider how that affects her emotionally.\n\nThe answer likely leans towards \"A\" (he's in the wrong) because maintaining a relationship without full commitment and intentions to pursue others can be deceitful, especially when the other person is emotionally invested.\n"
