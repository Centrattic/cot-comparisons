I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other women. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy who met a girl on Tinder. They had a long-distance relationship, with her being very attached. He felt scared about her affection and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after some time, they reconnected, she told him she loves him, he didn't reciprocate but they planned to meet. They had a nice time, and now he's worried about how to handle the relationship. He's considering pursuing other women while keeping the current relationship, which he's afraid might lead to cheating.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether he's being honest and clear about his intentions. The girl in the relationship has expressed love, and he hasn't. But he's still in a relationship with her, sharing intimate moments. If he's planning to be with other people while in a relationship, that's typically considered a problem. Even if he's not cheating yet, the intention to pursue others while being in a relationship could be seen as a betrayal of trust.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's keeping the relationship going under the pretense of it being a long-distance one, but then planning to be with others, seems like a setup for emotional harm. The girl is into him and has invested emotionally. If he breaks up later, it might hurt her, but he's choosing not to do it now to avoid immediate pain, which might be a way to delay the inevitable and cause more damage later.\n\nAnother point is his stated mentality about getting experience for the \"one.\" That suggests he's not looking for a committed relationship with this girl, which she might not be aware of. If he's not being upfront about his intentions from the start, that's deceptive. Relationships usually require mutual understanding and agreement on their nature. If he's not truthful about wanting to date others, he's in the wrong.\n\nMoreover, he's already in a situation where he's sharing a room with her and having sex, which implies a level of commitment. If he's keeping this relationship while pursuing others, it's likely a betrayal of her trust. Even if he's not currently cheating, the intention to do so in the future without her knowledge is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest with his partner about his intentions and is planning to engage in behavior (pursuing others) that would be a violation of a typical relationship's expectations. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
