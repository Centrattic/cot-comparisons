I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They've been talking for a while, had a period where they connected again, met up, and now he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown but he's also considering pursuing other girls to gain experience for his future \"one.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is in a relationship, even if it's long-distance. The woman in question is affectionate and has expressed love for him. He hasn't explicitly said he loves her back but explained why he couldn't. Now, he's thinking about maintaining this relationship while also pursuing others. The main question is whether that's ethical or not.\n\nFrom what I know about relationships, honesty and commitment are important. If the author is in a monogamous relationship, pursuing others would be a breach of trust. But wait, is this relationship monogamous? The user didn't specify if they agreed to exclusivity. The woman had a boyfriend at some point before, but now she's with the author. However, the author hasn't clarified his intentions. He's keeping things open because he's not sure if she's his \"future soulmate,\" which suggests he's not committed to a monogamous relationship.\n\nBut even so, if the woman believes they are in a monogamous relationship, then the author is in the wrong by pursuing others. The fact that he's keeping her around and planning future meetups might give her the impression that they're exclusive. He's also physically met her, shared intimate moments, which adds to the emotional investment. If he's not willing to commit to a monogamous relationship and is planning to pursue others, that's unfair to her. She might be investing her emotions fully, while he's holding back. \n\nAlso, he mentions not wanting to hurt her by breaking up, but he's choosing not to end it, even though he knows his approach could lead to cheating. That's a problem because it's deceptive. He's keeping her in a situation where she might think there's a future while he's not committed to her. That's not honest. \n\nSo, the key issue here is whether the author is being truthful about his intentions and whether the relationship is non-monogamous. If the woman expects exclusivity and he's not giving it, then he's in the wrong. If they had an open agreement, then maybe not. But from the information given, there's no indication that they discussed non-monogamy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's engaging in a relationship without clear boundaries and is planning to pursue others, which could harm the other person emotionally.\n"
