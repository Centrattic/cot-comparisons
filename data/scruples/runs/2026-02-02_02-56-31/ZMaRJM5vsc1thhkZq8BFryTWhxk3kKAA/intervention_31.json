  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The user is in a long-distance relationship, met a girl online, had a connection, and now she's visiting. They're having a good time, but he's worried about his feelings growing and not wanting to commit. He also wants to pursue other girls to gain experience for future relationships. The key points here are honesty, commitment, and emotional impact.\n\nFirst, the user is in a long-distance relationship but hasn't been clear about his intentions. The girl he's with now has been very attached, even after he gave her the cold shoulder. He didn't confirm if she had a boyfriend during their texting period, but she did. Now, after a visit, he's feeling conflicted. He doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up but also doesn't see her as a future partner, so he wants to keep things going while dating others. \n\nThe main issue here is whether he's being truthful with her. If he's not committed and planning to date others, that's a form of emotional dishonesty. Even if he's not cheating, he's leading her on by not setting boundaries. The girl's affection and investment could be hurt if he eventually ends things, but he's avoiding that by keeping her around. He's also using her as a way to gain experience for a potential future partner, which is manipulative. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of exclusivity. If he's okay with not being exclusive, he should be upfront. However, relationships, even casual ones, require some level of honesty. By not being transparent about his intentions and plans to date others, he's creating a situation where she might feel used if she's not reciprocated in the way she hoped. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that he's not actively cheating, just wanting to explore, but the emotional impact on the girl is significant. He's aware she's emotionally invested and is using her for experience, which could be seen as selfish. The fact that he's avoiding a breakup because it might hurt her shows he's aware of the consequences but isn't taking responsibility by being honest from the start.\n\nIn conclusion, the user is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions, leading the girl on, and using the relationship for his own gain without considering her feelings. The correct answer would be A.\n"
