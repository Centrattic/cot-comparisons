I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship, and he's considering pursuing other girls while maintaining this relationship. The key points from the story are that he was initially scared of the girl's attachment, gave her the cold shoulder, then reconnected later. She told him she loves him, he didn't reciprocate but explained why. They met up, had a good time, and he's now worried about his growing feelings and the pressure to commit. He wants to keep the relationship but also explore other options without cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. In a committed relationship, even if it's long-distance, being emotionally and physically intimate with someone else is generally considered cheating. But here, the author mentions he's not in a committed relationship yet. He hasn't said \"I love you\" back, and they were planning to meet, but he's not sure about the future. However, they did spend time together, including intimate moments. The question is whether having those feelings while also wanting to pursue others is wrong.\n\nThe user's main issue is that he's conflicted between enjoying the girl's company and not wanting to hurt her if he eventually breaks up. He's also trying to gain experience before finding his \"one.\" The problem is if he's leading her on. If she believes there's a future with him, but he's already planning to pursue others, that's deceitful. Even if he's not in a formal relationship, if she's invested emotionally, he should be honest about his intentions.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of monogamy. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be wrong. But since he hasn't set clear boundaries with her, maybe he's not in a monogamous agreement. However, the fact that he's keeping her in his life while also considering others could be seen as using her, which is unethical.\n\nAlso, the girl bought a train ticket to visit him, indicating a level of commitment and investment from her side. If he's not committed, it might be unfair to her. The author's fear of hurting her by breaking up now shows he's aware of the potential harm. But he's also acknowledging that continuing the relationship might lead to cheating, which would definitely hurt her.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether it's wrong to maintain a relationship with someone while intending to pursue others. Since he hasn't been upfront about his intentions and is creating emotional attachment without a clear commitment, it's likely that he's in the wrong. He's not being honest, which is the main factor here. Even if he's not in a formal relationship, leading someone on without clear communication is unethical.\n"
