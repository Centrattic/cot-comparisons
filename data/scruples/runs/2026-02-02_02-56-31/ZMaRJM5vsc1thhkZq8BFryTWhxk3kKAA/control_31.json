I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl on Tinder, they started a long-distance relationship. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He distanced himself, then later reconnected. They met in person, had a good time, and she expressed love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. Now, he's feeling conflicted because he's developed feelings but also wants to explore other relationships before settling down. He's worried about cheating if he continues with her.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship with one person while pursuing others. The key factors are honesty and consent. In most relationships, exclusivity is expected unless otherwise agreed. If the author isn't honest with the girl about his intentions to pursue others, that's a problem. However, the scenario isn't entirely clear on whether the current relationship is exclusive. The girl might think it's a monogamous relationship, and if the author is seeing others without her knowledge, that's cheating. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's not sure if he can commit long-term and wants to gain experience. That's his personal choice, but he needs to communicate that to the girl. If he's not upfront, he's being deceptive, which is wrong. The fact that he's planning to break up eventually but is leading her on without transparency makes this a potential issue.\n\nAnother angle is the initial behavior. He gave her the cold shoulder out of fear, which might have been inconsiderate. Now, he's in a situation where he's emotionally involved and might be leading her on again. If there's no mutual understanding about exclusivity, pursuing others while in a relationship is unethical. The author should either commit to being exclusive or end the relationship to pursue others honestly.\n\nSo, putting it all together: if the author is in a relationship without clear boundaries about exclusivity and is actively pursuing others, he's in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes), because he's not being honest and is likely leading her on, which can cause emotional harm.\n"
