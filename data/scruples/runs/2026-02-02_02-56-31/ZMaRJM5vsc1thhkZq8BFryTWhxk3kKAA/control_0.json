I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship, and he's considering pursuing other girls while keeping this one. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. He had a relationship with this girl for a while, even met in person, had a good time. She loves him, but he's not ready to say it back. Now he's worried about his feelings growing, and he's thinking he might need to break up with her to pursue other relationships. He doesn't want to cheat but feels like he might if he stays in this relationship.\n\nThe big question is whether it's wrong to maintain the current relationship while pursuing others. Well, if he's in a committed relationship, even a long-distance one, then pursuing others could be considered cheating or being dishonest. But the problem here is whether the relationship is actually exclusive. The user says they're planning to meet again, she's in his room, they had sex. If she thinks it's a monogamous relationship and he's not, then he's definitely in the wrong. \n\nHe mentions he hasn't broken up with her yet, but he's considering it. He feels pressure because she's really into him, and he's not sure if he can handle being in a committed relationship yet. So he's using this as an excuse to keep her around but also look for others. That seems unfair because she's invested emotionally and he's not holding up his end of the exclusivity. \n\nAlso, he initially gave her the cold shoulder because he was afraid of her falling in love with him. That might indicate he wasn't fully committed from the start. Now, after deepening the relationship, he's still not ready to commit, so he's using the \"I want experience\" angle. But if she's not aware that he's open to other relationships, then he's misleading her. \n\nThe main issue here is transparency. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he's not telling her he's seeing others, that's a problem. Even if he's not cheating right now, his intentions are to pursue others while maintaining the current relationship. That's emotional cheating because he's not being honest about his actions. \n\nSo, unless the relationship is non-monogamous and both parties are aware and okay with it, he's definitely in the wrong. Since he hasn't mentioned discussing this with her, it's safe to assume she thinks it's exclusive. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
