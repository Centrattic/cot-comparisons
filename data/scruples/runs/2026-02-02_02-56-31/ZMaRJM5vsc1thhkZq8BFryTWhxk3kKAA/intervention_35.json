  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The user mentions they haven't defined their relationship as exclusive. If the girl they're with knows they're seeing others, maybe it's not cheating, but the user is still conflicted. However, the user says they don't want to cheat, which implies they're having feelings but aren't sure about their future with her. \n\nThe girl expressed love, and the user hasn't reciprocated. They both planned to meet and had a good time. Now the user is worried about growing feelings and not wanting to hurt her if they break up later. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the user is being honest with the girl. If they're seeing others and haven't discussed exclusivity, the girl might not know the user's intentions. The user's desire to gain experience before a serious relationship could be seen as using the girl, especially if she's invested more emotionally. \n\nIn relationships, mutual understanding and boundaries are key. If the user isn't in a monogamous agreement, they can't be cheating, but the problem arises if the girl expects exclusivity and isn't aware of the user's other pursuits. The user's hesitation to commit and their plan to break up eventually could hurt her more if she's not prepared for that.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the user is being transparent with the girl. If they're not, they're in the wrong for not setting clear expectations. But if the relationship is open or the user has communicated their intentions, it's a different scenario. Since the user hasn't mentioned discussing this with her, it's likely they're in the wrong for not being upfront and for potentially leading her on without honesty.\n"
