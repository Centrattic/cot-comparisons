  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship who's considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current one. He's worried about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. He started a relationship with a girl they've never met for a while, then after reconnecting, they had a meet-up. Now, he's conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's also thinking about trying other relationships before finding his \"one.\" The core issue is whether it's ethical to pursue other girls while in a relationship, even if it's long-distance.\n\nHe mentions that she's into him a lot and he's afraid of hurting her by breaking up now. He wants to give time for things to settle. But the problem is that pursuing other girls while in a committed relationship is generally considered cheating. Even if they haven't met in person, if they're in a romantic relationship, exclusive commitment is expected. \n\nHe also says he doesn't want to cheat but feels he might if he continues. This shows internal conflict. The user is trying to justify his actions by saying he's just gaining experience for the future, but that's a common excuse for polygamy or cheating. \n\nLong-distance relationships are tough, and communication is key. If he's not ready to commit exclusively, he should have been honest from the start. The fact that he's planning to break up later, after causing emotional harm, is problematic. He's putting his needs first without considering her feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's engaging in behavior that's not honest and is likely to hurt her. Even if the relationship isn't officially defined, if there's a mutual understanding of exclusivity, pursuing others is deceitful. The user needs to confront his feelings and decide whether he's ready for a committed relationship or not, rather than stringing her along.\n"
