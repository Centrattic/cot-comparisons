I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details given. The author is in a long-distance relationship that started via Tinder. The girl was very attached early on, which made him uncomfortable, leading him to pull away. After some time, they reconnect, meet up, have an intimate experience, and she expresses love, but he doesn't reciprocate. They plan to see each other again, but he's now feeling conflicted because he's growing feelings and also wants to pursue other relationships without cheating.\n\nKey points to consider: The author hasn't been entirely honest about his intentions. He started the relationship with her while already knowing he might not be fully committed. Additionally, he's considering pursuing other girls while in a relationship, which could be seen as emotionally manipulative or deceptive. Even if he's not cheating, the act of pursuing others while in a relationship can be considered dishonest, especially if she believes they are in a committed relationship. He's also aware that she's emotionally invested and might feel hurt if he breaks up with her later. \n\nAnother angle is the timeline. The relationship started as long-distance, with him pulling away initially due to fear of her attachment. Now, after reconnecting and spending time together, he's conflicted. The fact that he hasn't communicated his intentions clearly to her is a problem. If he's not ready to commit but is leading her on, that's a red flag. The author's approach of wanting to \"gain experience\" before committing to a future partner also raises questions about his maturity and readiness for a serious relationship.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, being in a relationship (even long-distance) while secretly planning to pursue others can be seen as deceitful. The girl has invested emotionally, and he hasn't been upfront about his intentions. Even if he hasn't cheated yet, the intention to pursue others while in a relationship can be considered unethical. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
