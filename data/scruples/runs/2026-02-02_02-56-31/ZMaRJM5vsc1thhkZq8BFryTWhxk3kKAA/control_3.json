I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship. They met someone online, the girl became very attached, and even after a year, they're planning to meet again. The author says they don't want to commit fully because they're not sure if she's the one. But they enjoy the relationship and don't want to hurt her by breaking up. However, they also feel the need to pursue other girls for experience so they're ready for their \"one.\"\n\nNow, the key points here are about honesty and commitment. In a relationship, even a long-distance one, there are usually expectations of exclusivity and some level of commitment. The author is considering pursuing other relationships, which sounds like cheating if they're in a monogamous agreement. The problem is that the girl has expressed her feelings (she said she loves him), and the author hasn't reciprocated. But they're still maintaining the relationship, which could be seen as leading her on.\n\nThe author is worried about breaking up with her because it might hurt her, but they're staying in the relationship out of convenience or fear of hurting her. That seems manipulative. Also, their reasoning for needing to date others to find \"the one\" implies they're not ready to commit, which the girl might not have been made aware of. If the author is in a monogamous relationship and then pursuing others, that's definitely unethical.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they're not being honest about their intentions and are potentially leading the girl on while planning to be unfaithful. They should either commit to the relationship or break up honestly rather than keeping her in a situation where she's emotionally invested without full transparency.\n"
