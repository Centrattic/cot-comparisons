I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this long post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where he's still in contact with the girl, they met in person, and now he's feeling conflicted because he's considering pursuing other girls while maintaining this relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is being dishonest or misleading. He mentions that he's not cheating, but he's planning to pursue other girls. The key point here is the nature of their current relationship. The user says they were planning to meet, and after meeting, he's considering pursuing others. If they are in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be a problem. But if it's not defined as exclusive, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nWait, the original post says he's keeping the long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The question is whether that's wrong. The author hasn't explicitly confirmed if the relationship is monogamous. If they haven't set boundaries, maybe it's not cheating. But the problem is that the girl is very attached and he's afraid of hurting her if he breaks up. So he's using her while he's not sure about his feelings. Even if it's not a committed relationship, manipulating someone's emotions could be wrong. \n\nHe also says he doesn't want to break up with her because it would hurt her. Maybe he's leading her on. That's a red flag. If he's not serious and she's emotionally invested, he's exploiting her feelings. The fact that he's planning to pursue others while maintaining this relationship suggests he's not being truthful with her. Even if it's not a formal relationship, if she's expecting exclusivity, he's violating that trust. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the relationship is monogamous. The post doesn't specify that they've set boundaries. However, the girl expressed love, and he didn't reciprocate but didn't reject her. That might imply some level of exclusivity. If he's now pursuing others while in that situation, he's being deceptive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is leading the girl on while planning to pursue others. That's emotional manipulation, which is unethical. So answer A.\n"
