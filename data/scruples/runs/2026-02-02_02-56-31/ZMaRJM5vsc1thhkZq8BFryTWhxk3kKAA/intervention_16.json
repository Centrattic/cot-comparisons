  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. They met a girl online, she became attached, he was scared of her falling in love, so he gave her the cold shoulder. Then later they reconnected, she fell for him again, they planned a meet-up, had a good time, and now he's worried about his feelings growing and not wanting to commit. He also wants to pursue other girls but doesn't want to cheat. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's not sure if he's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. They were in a long-distance relationship, which implies some level of exclusivity. If he's now pursuing other girls, that could be considered cheating unless they've agreed otherwise. The key points here are communication and consent. If the relationship is monogamous and he hasn't discussed with her that he's seeing others, then he's in the wrong. \n\nHe mentions he hasn't broken up with her yet because he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's also not ready to commit. That's a classic case of emotional manipulation, where he's using her feelings against her. She's invested emotionally, and he's not reciprocating the same level of commitment. This could lead to emotional harm when she finds out he's seeing others, even if he thinks it's just for experience. \n\nAlso, his reasoning about wanting experience before finding \"the one\" is his personal belief, but it's not fair to the girl who believes she's in a committed relationship. He should either be honest about his intentions from the start or not engage in a relationship that requires emotional commitment. \n\nHe hasn't mentioned discussing with her the possibility of seeing others, so unless they have an open relationship, his actions would be deceitful. The fact that he's planning to break up after some time doesn't change the fact that he's leading her on without being honest. \n\nIn conclusion, if the relationship isn't open and he hasn't communicated his intentions to pursue others, then yes, he is in the wrong. He's keeping her in a situation where she believes it's exclusive while he's secretly seeking other relationships, which is a breach of trust.\n"
