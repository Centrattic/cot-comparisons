I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The guy met a girl online, they had a long-distance relationship for a while. He felt scared about her attachment and gave her the cold shoulder. Then after some time, they reconnect, she says she loves him, and they meet in person. He feels more attached now but is worried about the future because he doesn't want this to be his long-term partner. He also mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls for when his \"real\" relationship comes along. \n\nThe key points here are whether he's being honest and whether he's being deceptive. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, but he's planning to pursue others, that's a problem. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for wanting to keep the relationship while pursuing others. The author's justification is that he doesn't want to ruin the girl's feelings and wants to take time. But if he's not honest with her about his intentions, that's where the issue lies. \n\nIn many relationships, even long-distance, exclusivity is expected. If the author isn't upfront about his intentions to pursue others, he's being deceptive. The fact that he's aware he might cheat if he continues suggests he's not being truthful to himself or her. \n\nAlso, the girl has invested a lot emotionally, even to the point of visiting him. If he's not committed and is planning to look elsewhere, that's leading her on. The author's mindset of saving the \"right\" relationship for later while using this one as practice is problematic because it's not honest and could hurt her.\n\nSo, yes, he's in the wrong because he's not being truthful about his intentions and is leading her on. Answer A.\n"
