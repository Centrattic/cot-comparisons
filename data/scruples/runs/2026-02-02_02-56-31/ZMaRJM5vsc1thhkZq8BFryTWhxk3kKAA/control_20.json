I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder a year ago. They didn't meet for a while, and then he reconnected with her around Christmas. They met up, had a great time, including sex, and she said she loves him. He didn't reciprocate the love, but he's now considering pursuing other girls while keeping the long-distance relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any mention of whether the relationship is exclusive. The author says he's in a long-distance relationship, but does that mean it's exclusive? He doesn't explicitly state that. However, in most cases, a relationship\u2014especially one that involves meeting in person and having a sexual relationship\u2014is expected to be monogamous unless otherwise agreed. The fact that he's thinking about pursuing others while maintaining this relationship could be an issue if it's supposed to be exclusive.\n\nHe also mentions that he's twenty-two and wants to get experience before finding his \"one.\" That's a common mindset, but the problem arises if he's in a committed relationship where exclusivity is expected. If the relationship isn't exclusive, maybe it's okay. But the key point here is that he hasn't communicated his intentions to her. She might believe she's in a monogamous relationship, and if he's planning to pursue others, that's deceitful. \n\nHe's worried about breaking up because he thinks it would hurt her, but he's not addressing his own actions. The fact that they met up and he's keeping her in his room (which sounds like a live-in situation?) might imply a level of commitment. Also, he's using emotional pressure by saying he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's the one creating a situation where he's not honest about his feelings and plans. \n\nThe main ethical issue here is about honesty and exclusivity. If he's not committed to being monogamous, but is acting in a way that makes her believe the relationship is exclusive, then he's in the wrong. The question is whether he's being truthful with her. Since he hasn't told her about his intentions to pursue others, it's a clear case of misleading her. Even if the relationship isn't formally exclusive, once you're in a relationship with someone, especially one that's physical and emotional, pursuing others without being upfront is generally considered wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is likely leading her on without considering her feelings or the exclusivity of their relationship.\n"
