  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. Let me break down their situation.\n\nFirst, they met a girl online, she became very attached, but he pulled away because he felt scared. Now, after some time, they reconnect, meet in person, and things are great. He's grown feelings but is scared of getting too invested because he doesn't see her as his future partner. He also wants to gain experience with other girls before meeting \"the one.\" The main issue is whether he's acting wrongly by continuing this relationship while looking for others.\n\nLooking at the key points: The user is not in a committed monogamous relationship. The girl has a history of having a boyfriend, and their communication was mostly online. They haven't set clear boundaries. He's concerned about leading her on and hurting her if he breaks up later. The user's intention is to gain experience for future relationships, but he's worried about cheating if he continues with her.\n\nIn relationships, honesty and consent are crucial. If both parties are aware and okay with non-monogamous arrangements, then it's not wrong. However, in this case, there's no mention of the girl knowing he's interested in others. He's using her for emotional connection while planning to see other people, which could be seen as manipulative. Also, he's not sure if he's leading her on, which might be emotionally harmful if she expects a more serious commitment. \n\nHe's not cheating yet, but his intent to pursue others while keeping her close could be deceptive. Even if he doesn't see her as a long-term partner, he's forming emotional bonds that might not be reciprocated in the way she expects. Leading someone on without clear communication can be considered wrong because it doesn't respect her feelings and autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being transparent about his intentions and might be causing emotional harm without her consent.\n"
