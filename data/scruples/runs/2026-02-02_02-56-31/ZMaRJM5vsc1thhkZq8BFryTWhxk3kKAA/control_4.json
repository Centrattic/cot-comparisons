I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The author is a 22-year-old guy who met a girl on Tinder, had a long-distance relationship, met her, and now feels conflicted about his growing feelings and the possibility of cheating by pursuing others. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in a committed relationship. The original post says they were planning to meet and had a three-day visit. The key point here is whether the relationship is considered exclusive. The author mentions that they haven't officially labeled the relationship as exclusive, but they were talking about meeting up and had intimate moments. However, the author also states that they don't want to commit fully yet because they want to gain experience for their future \"soulmate.\"\n\nThe author is considering pursuing other girls while staying with this girl. The question is whether this makes him the asshole. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then technically, he's not cheating. However, the girl might have assumed exclusivity, especially since they had a visit and expressed love. The author didn't confirm the exclusivity, which could lead to misunderstandings. \n\nAlso, the author says he can't commit because he doesn't see her as his future partner but enjoys her company. This sounds like a casual relationship, but the girl might have different expectations. If the author is leading her on, thinking she's the only one when he's actually seeing others, that would be wrong. But if the author hasn't committed to exclusivity and the girl hasn't been told otherwise, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nHowever, after meeting and having intimacy, there's an implicit assumption of exclusivity in many relationships. The author's plan to pursue others while maintaining this relationship could be seen as emotionally manipulative, even if there's no formal commitment. The girl might feel used or hurt if she believes she's in a monogamous relationship while he's not.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the expectations. If the author hasn't established exclusivity and the girl hasn't been informed that he's open to seeing others, then he's being deceptive. But if both parties understand that it's non-exclusive, then it's not his fault. However, the author's hesitation to break up and the pressure he feels suggest that he's creating a situation where the girl is emotionally invested without clear boundaries. The author should communicate his intentions honestly to avoid leading her on. Since he's considering breaking up later, maybe he's already in the wrong by not being upfront from the start.\n"
