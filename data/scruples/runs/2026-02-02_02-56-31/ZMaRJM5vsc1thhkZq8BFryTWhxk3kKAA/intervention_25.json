  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where he's considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current one. He's 22, and he's been in this relationship with a girl he met online. They have a history of on-and-off communication, met in person, had a nice time, and now he's worried about his feelings growing too strong or not being able to handle the distance. He wants to keep the relationship but also explore other options to gain experience before committing long-term. \n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether it's okay for him to continue the relationship while also pursuing others. The key points are: the relationship is long-distance, they met online, there's a history of emotional attachment from her side, and he's not sure about his feelings. He's afraid of hurting her if he breaks up now but doesn't want to commit fully. He's also concerned about cheating if he doesn't address his desire to pursue others.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, honesty and commitment are important in relationships. If he's not emotionally committed and is considering pursuing others, that's a problem. Even if he's not cheating right now, the intention to pursue others while in a relationship could be seen as disingenuous. The girl has shown strong feelings and even said she loves him, which might imply some level of exclusivity. He hasn't explicitly set boundaries about seeing other people, which could lead to her being hurt later if he does decide to move on or if she finds out he's been seeing others.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's using the excuse of gaining experience for a future \"real\" relationship doesn't mitigate the potential harm. The girl deserves to know his intentions upfront. If he's not ready to commit and is using her as a stepping stone, that's not fair. Even if he's not cheating yet, the plan to pursue others suggests a lack of commitment, which is a problem in a relationship where one person is emotionally invested.\n\nAnother angle is the distance. Long-distance relationships require a lot of trust and communication. If he's planning to be with others, that could break the trust she's placing in him. The fact that he's keeping her in his room during her visit also adds a layer of physical intimacy, which might make the situation more complicated if he's not being truthful about his intentions.\n\nSo, putting this all together: he's in a relationship where he's not emotionally committed, is considering pursuing others, and hasn't communicated his intentions clearly. This could definitely lead to hurt feelings and betrayal. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially leading her on without considering her feelings.\n"
