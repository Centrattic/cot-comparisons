I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and also pursuing other girls. The author is 22, had a relationship that started online with a girl he's never met in person until recently. They met, had a good time, and now he's feeling conflicted because he's thinking about pursuing others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their relationship. The user says he hasn't deleted her from social media and was hesitant at first. Then, after reconnecting, they met up, had a physical relationship, and he's now considering breaking up with her because he doesn't want to commit fully yet.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. If both parties entered the relationship with clear intentions and agreed on the terms (like being exclusive or not), then it's about following through. However, the author is now considering pursuing others while still in a relationship, which might be a breach of trust if the relationship was supposed to be exclusive.\n\nThe author mentions he hasn't committed to her emotionally, even after meeting and spending time together. The fact that he's planning to break up with her later might be seen as avoiding responsibility. Also, pursuing other girls while in a relationship, regardless of the type, can be considered dishonest if it's not communicated. Even in long-distance or non-exclusive arrangements, transparency is important.\n\nHe also says he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up now, but that doesn't justify continuing the relationship while planning to be unfaithful. The author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for future relationships, but this approach can lead to emotional harm for the current partner. \n\nSo, the ethical issue here is about honesty and respect. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then it's a different scenario, but the author hasn't mentioned that. He seems to be assuming he can have his cake and eat it too\u2014keeping the relationship while also seeing others, which is a form of emotional dishonesty. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong because he's not being truthful with the girl and is leading her on while planning to pursue others. The correct choice is A.\n"
