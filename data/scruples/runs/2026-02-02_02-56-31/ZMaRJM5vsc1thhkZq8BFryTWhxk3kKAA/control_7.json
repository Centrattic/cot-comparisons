I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a guy in a long-distance relationship who's considering pursuing other girls. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl on Tinder, and she became very attached to him even though they hadn't met. He felt uncomfortable with her affection and pulled back. Then, after a while, she reconnected with him, they met in person, had a great time, and she told him she loves him. He didn't reciprocate but said he wasn't ready. Now, he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure she's putting on him. He wants to continue the relationship but also wants to date others to gain experience for the future.\n\nHmm. The key issues here are about honesty and commitment. If the author is in a relationship, even a long-distance one, then pursuing other relationships without informing her would be a problem. But wait, the author hasn't actually confirmed if they're in a committed relationship. The girl said she loves him, but he didn't return the feelings. They had plans to meet, and he's keeping her in his room. But was there an official commitment? The original question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to stay with her while pursuing others.\n\nThe author mentions he's not sure if she still has a boyfriend during the time they were reconnecting. Wait, in the original story, she had a boyfriend somewhere in between the ten months. So when they reconnected, he thought she might still be with someone. But then they ended up meeting, and she's now in a situation where they're intimate. If she was in a committed relationship at that point, then the author would be in the wrong. But the text says she was in a relationship \"somewhere in between those ten months,\" implying that maybe she's single now. But the author isn't clear on that. Also, when she told him she loves him, he didn't reciprocate. So maybe their relationship isn't officially monogamous?\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a long-distance relationship but isn't clear if it's exclusive. If the girl assumes exclusivity and he's planning to see other people, that's a problem. But if they never discussed exclusivity, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, when someone says \"I love you,\" expectations of commitment usually come into play. The author is keeping her in his room, sharing a house, which could imply a level of exclusivity. So if he's pursuing others while in a situation that's perceived as a committed relationship, that's being dishonest and could hurt her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for his future \"one,\" but that's a bit selfish. The girl might be emotionally invested and not know that he's not committed. The author is also aware that breaking up might hurt her, but he's procrastinating instead of being honest. By pursuing others, he's leading her on and could be setting her up for more heartbreak if he eventually breaks up. That's manipulative.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's leading the girl on in what seems like a committed relationship while planning to be unfaithful. Even if there's no formal commitment, the actions and statements (like her saying she loves him) imply a level of exclusivity that he's violating by pursuing others. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
