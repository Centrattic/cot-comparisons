I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 22, in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They've been on and off, met up, had a good time, but he's emotionally conflicted. He's worried about his growing feelings and doesn't want to commit, so he's considering pursuing other girls. He doesn't want to cheat but feels like he might if he continues this relationship.\n\nLooking at the key points: The relationship is long-distance, which can be challenging. The author hasn't explicitly committed to a monogamous relationship. He's unsure about his feelings and is using the idea of gaining experience for future relationships as a justification. However, he's concerned about hurting his current partner if he breaks up now.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. However, if it's non-exclusive, maybe not. But the author hasn't clarified this with his partner. The main issue is honesty. If he's not being upfront about his intentions and is leading her on, that's a problem. The fact that he's planning to meet again and is emotionally involved while also considering others suggests he's not being truthful, which can be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate. If they continue, she might develop deeper feelings, and if he breaks up later, it would hurt her more. So, maintaining the relationship while not being committed could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships (even long-distance) usually imply some level of exclusivity and mutual commitment. If the author isn't willing to commit and is planning to pursue others, that's a breach of trust. Therefore, he's in the wrong if the relationship is expected to be monogamous and he hasn't communicated his intentions. If it's open, maybe not, but there's no indication that's the case here. The key is the lack of communication and his intention to lead her on for his own benefit without considering her feelings seriously.\n"
