I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've been talking for a while, met up, had a good time, and she's clearly really into him. Now he's worried that his feelings for her have grown more, and he's thinking about pursuing other girls because he wants to gain experience before finding his \"one.\" But he's also conflicted about cheating and hurting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. He didn't explicitly state whether they're in a monogamous relationship or if it's open. From the description, it seems like they were a couple after meeting up, but he's unsure about his feelings. The key point here is that he's considering continuing the relationship while also pursuing others. That sounds like cheating if the relationship is monogamous.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. If the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing other girls would be a breach of trust and commitment. The author is already in a serious situation where she's expressed love to him, and he's keeping her in the relationship but not reciprocating fully. Now, adding other relationships without her knowledge would definitely be wrong. \n\nAlso, he mentions he's scared of her falling in love with him and then hurting her, but he's not considering the impact of his actions on her. If he's not committed to a monogamous relationship and she is, he's being dishonest. The fact that he's planning to break up with her later doesn't excuse the cheating. The question is about whether he's in the wrong now, while he's still in the relationship. \n\nAnother angle: the user might think that as long as he doesn't cheat, it's okay. But if he's not honest about his intentions from the start, that's an issue. He should communicate his need for non-monogamy if that's what he's thinking, but given that she's in love with him, it's unlikely she would agree to an open relationship. So, he's keeping her under false pretenses, which is unethical.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's planning to pursue other relationships while in a relationship with someone who's emotionally invested in him without her consent. That's a classic case of being in the wrong.\n"
