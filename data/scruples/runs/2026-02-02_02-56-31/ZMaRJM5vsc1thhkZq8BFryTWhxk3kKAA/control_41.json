I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 22, in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They had a previous connection, then drifted apart. Now, they reconnected, met in person, and things are going well. The author is worried about his growing feelings and the pressure of the relationship. He also mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls so he doesn't mess up with \"the one.\" The key issue here is whether he's being deceptive or unethical by pursuing others while in a relationship.\n\nThe user provided the scenario where the author is considering whether to break up with her to avoid hurting her later. But he's not doing that now. He's maintaining the relationship but also looking at other options. The question is if that makes him the asshole.\n\nHmm. In relationships, especially if it's a romantic one, being exclusive is usually expected. If the author hasn't clarified the terms and is now pursuing others, that's a problem. He mentions they met in person, had sex, and he's in her room. That sounds like a romantic relationship. If he's not honest about wanting to be with others, he's being unfair to her. She might think it's a monogamous relationship, and he's not communicating his intentions. That's a red flag. So, yes, he's in the wrong because he's not being honest and is using her for experience while leading her on. The answer should be A.\n"
