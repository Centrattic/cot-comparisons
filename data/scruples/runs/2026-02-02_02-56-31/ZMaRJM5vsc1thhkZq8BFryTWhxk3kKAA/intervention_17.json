  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship. He's been with this girl for a while, met her in person, had a good time, but now he's feeling conflicted because he's also interested in pursuing other girls. He doesn't want to cheat, but he's worried he might if he keeps dating her. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to maintain the relationship while also seeing others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of relationships. If they're in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be cheating, which is wrong. But the user hasn't specified if they're in a monogamous or non-monogamous agreement. The post doesn't mention any prior agreement about exclusivity. The girl said she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate, but they continued the relationship. Maybe they didn't have clear boundaries set.\n\nThen, there's the issue of emotional investment. The user is worried about hurting her if he breaks up now, but he also feels pressure from his own desires. He's using the excuse that he's just trying to gain experience before finding his \"soulmate.\" That mindset could be problematic because it's not respecting her feelings and commitment. If he's not ready to commit, maybe he shouldn't be in a relationship in the first place.\n\nAnother angle is consent and communication. If the user isn't honest about his intentions and plans to pursue others, that's a breach of trust. Even if the relationship isn't exclusive on paper, the way it's been conducted\u2014meeting in person, intimate moments\u2014implies a level of exclusivity. Pursuing others without discussing it would be deceitful.\n\nAlso, the user's fear of hurting her is valid, but that doesn't justify his actions. It's better to communicate honestly to avoid deeper hurt later. The user's approach of waiting and seeing if things calm down might just prolong the inevitable hurt for both parties.\n\nSo, putting it all together, if the relationship is monogamous and the user is planning to be with others without her knowledge, that's definitely wrong. Even if it's not explicitly monogamous, the lack of communication about his intentions makes it his fault. The answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
