  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is in a long-distance relationship but is also considering pursuing other girls. The key points here are honesty, commitment, and emotional impact.\n\nFirst, the user met a girl online, and she became very attached. He felt scared and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after some time, they reconnect and decide to meet. She visits him, and their relationship becomes more intimate. Now he's worried about his growing feelings and wants to continue the relationship but also wants to date others to gain experience for his future \"one.\"\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if this is a committed relationship, pursuing others without her knowledge would be cheating. The user hasn't explicitly mentioned that she's aware of his intentions to date others. If the relationship is monogamous, then he's in the wrong. However, if they've agreed on an open relationship, that's different. But the user hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries. \n\nThe girl expressed love, and he didn't reciprocate. She's into him, and he's using her for experience, which could be emotionally manipulative. Even if he doesn't want to break her heart, being dishonest about his intentions is still harmful. The user might think he's being kind by not breaking up immediately, but leading her on without honesty is unfair. The user's plan to take time to see if things calm down doesn't address the core issue of his infidelity or lack of commitment. \n\nIn conclusion, if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then yes, he's in the wrong. If not, maybe, but the lack of communication suggests he isn't transparent. So, answer A.\n"
