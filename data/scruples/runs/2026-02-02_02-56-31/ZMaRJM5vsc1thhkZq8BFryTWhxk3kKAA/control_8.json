I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They hadn't met in person for a while, and after reconnecting, they had an in-person meeting. The author feels his feelings are growing, but he's afraid of being in a long-term relationship. He mentions he wants to gain experience with other girls before settling down, but he's also not wanting to cheat. The key point is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship while pursuing others.\n\nIn many relationships, exclusivity is expected. If the author's partner isn't aware he's pursuing others, that's a problem. However, the author hasn't explicitly stated whether he's been honest about his intentions. The fact that he's planning to break up eventually might mitigate some blame, but the act of pursuing others while in a relationship, even if long-distance, could be seen as deceitful or disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he's not looking to commit right now and wants to \"get as much experience as possible.\" This suggests he's not emotionally committed and might be using the relationship as a stepping stone. That could be considered selfish, especially since the other person might be emotionally invested. Even if the relationship isn't exclusive, the author's actions could hurt the partner, especially if they expected monogamy.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is transparent about his intentions. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he's seeing others without consent, that's unethical. However, if it's an open or polyamorous relationship with mutual understanding, then it's different. The story doesn't mention any agreement about exclusivity, so it's likely the author is violating unspoken expectations.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because he's engaging in behavior that could harm his partner without their knowledge or consent, which is a breach of trust and respect in most relational contexts.\n"
