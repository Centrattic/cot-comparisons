  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to maintain a long-distance relationship with a girl while also pursuing other girls. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the user met a girl online, they talked for a while, but he wasn't sure about his feelings. Then, after some time, they reconnected, met in person, had a good time, and she confessed her love. He didn't return the feelings but they stayed in contact. Now, he's worried about growing feelings and the pressure of the relationship, and he wants to pursue other girls. He doesn't want to cheat but feels like he might if he continues the current relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of their relationship. She bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, had sex, and he's considering whether to break up with her to explore other relationships. The user's intention is to \"get experience\" for future relationships, which implies he's not in a committed monogamous relationship. However, if the relationship is considered a romantic one, being physically intimate with her while pursuing others could be seen as deceptive or unethical if he's not transparent. \n\nBut the user hasn't explicitly stated whether he's in a monogamous relationship with her. If they're both aware and okay with non-monogamous terms, then it's a different scenario. However, the user seems to be planning to pursue others without mentioning if he's communicated this. The girl has expressed love and the user hasn't returned it, suggesting he might not have set clear boundaries from the start. \n\nAlso, considering the girl's feelings: she's invested emotionally and physically, and the user is now considering breaking up with her, which could hurt her. The user's main concern is his own emotional state and desire to gain experience, which might be prioritizing his needs over hers. If he hasn't discussed his intentions with her, then he's being dishonest, which would make him at fault. \n\nIn conclusion, if the relationship is supposed to be monogamous and he's pursuing others without consent, he's in the wrong. If it's non-monogamous and they've agreed, then maybe not. But based on the info given, it's likely monogamous, so the answer is A.\n"
