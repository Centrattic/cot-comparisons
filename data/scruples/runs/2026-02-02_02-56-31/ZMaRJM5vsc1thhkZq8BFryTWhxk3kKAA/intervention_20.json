I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to maintain a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. They're 22, and they've been in this situation where they met a girl online, had a connection, then things cooled down because he was afraid of her getting too attached. Now they've reconnected, had a meet-up, and he's feeling conflicted about his growing feelings and the pressure she's putting on him. He wants to gain experience for his future soulmate but doesn't want to actually cheat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of the situation. The key points here are the long-distance aspect, the emotional dynamics, and the person's intention to pursue other relationships. The main question is whether it's ethical to continue the relationship while also being open to other possibilities, especially if it might lead to cheating. \n\nLong-distance relationships can be challenging, especially when there's a significant emotional connection. The user is worried about his feelings growing and not wanting to hurt the girl, but also doesn't see her as a future partner. He's trying to balance his desire for experience without committing long-term. However, the problem arises when he's considering pursuing other girls. If he's in a relationship, even a long-distance one, with this girl, pursuing others would be cheating, which is generally considered wrong. But he's not in a monogamous relationship yet. Wait, the user hasn't clarified if the relationship is exclusive or not. The girl bought a train ticket to visit him, and they had intimate moments. If they're in a dating relationship, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust. \n\nHe mentions that he didn't say \"I love you\" and that she's fun but not his soulmate. He's using the relationship as a way to gain experience for the future. However, if he's not honest about his intentions and continues to engage in the relationship while actively pursuing others, that's where the ethical issue comes in. The girl has invested emotionally, and if he's not committed to exclusivity, he's leading her on. Even if he's not in a formal monogamous relationship, if they consider themselves in a relationship, then pursuing others without clear boundaries is problematic. \n\nAnother angle is the pressure he feels. He's worried about hurting her if he breaks up, but he's also avoiding a breakup by staying in the relationship while planning to pursue others. This could be seen as selfish. The user's reasoning about wanting experience is a common one, but using others for practice without their knowledge or consent is where it crosses into being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, considering the girl's attachment and his role in fostering that, he might be contributing to her emotional investment. If he's aware of her feelings and his own mixed intentions, continuing the relationship without being upfront could be manipulative. \n\nIn terms of the options, the user is asking if he's the asshole (A) or not (B). The ethical stance here depends on the expectations of the relationship. If it's a non-exclusive arrangement, maybe it's okay, but the way he's described it suggests a more traditional dating context. Therefore, wanting to maintain the relationship while pursuing others (potentially leading to cheating) would make him the asshole because he's not being transparent and is using the girl for his own benefit without considering her feelings beyond the immediate.\n"
