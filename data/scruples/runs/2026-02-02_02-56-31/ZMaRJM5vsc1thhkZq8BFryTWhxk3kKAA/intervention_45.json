  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They never met until recently, and after some time apart, she expressed love for him. He didn't reciprocate but explained his feelings. They met up, had a good time, and now he's feeling conflicted because he doesn't believe she's his future partner but still wants to keep her around while pursuing others.\n\nFirst, the key issue is honesty. He mentioned he can't say he loves her back, and he's worried about being in a relationship he doesn't see as long-term. If he's not in love and isn't planning to commit, continuing the relationship might be deceptive. The girl seems attached and has invested emotionally, which could lead to heartbreak if he ends it later.\n\nAnother point is the user's intention to pursue other girls without cheating. Even if he's not cheating, being in a relationship while planning to be with others could be considered emotionally deceptive. The girl might believe they're exclusive, and his actions could mislead her about his commitment.\n\nThe user also acknowledges that breaking up now would hurt her, but he doesn't want to do that. However, keeping her in a situation where he's not fully committed could be worse in the long run. The idea of \"getting experience\" with other girls before finding his \"soulmate\" suggests a pattern of not being fully present in relationships, which could be hurtful to all involved.\n\nThere's also the aspect of his fear of commitment. He's scared she might fall in love with him, leading him to push her away initially. Now, after connecting more, he's worried about his growing attachment. This internal conflict might lead to inconsistent behavior, making it harder for her to trust or feel secure.\n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual expectations are crucial. If he's not ready for a serious commitment, it's important to communicate that clearly to avoid leading her on. The fact that he's planning to meet her again and maintain the relationship while also wanting to pursue others is a red flag. It could be seen as emotionally manipulative or inconsiderate of her feelings.\n\nUltimately, the user is in a position where he's not being fully honest about his intentions. By continuing the relationship without a clear commitment, he's putting her at risk of emotional harm. The answer would lean towards him being in the wrong because of the lack of clear communication and the potential for hurting her down the line.\n"
