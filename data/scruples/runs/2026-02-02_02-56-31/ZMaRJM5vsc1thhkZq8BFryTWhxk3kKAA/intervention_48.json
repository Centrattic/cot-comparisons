  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for continuing a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, he met a girl online, she became very attached, and he wasn't sure about his feelings. He gave her the cold shoulder out of fear. Then months later, they reconnect, she buys a ticket to visit him, they have a great time, and she's affectionate. He's now worried about his growing feelings and the pressure, so he's considering pursuing others to gain experience before finding his \"soulmate.\" He's conflicted between not wanting to hurt her by breaking up and his desire to explore other relationships.\n\nNow, the key points here: he's in a committed relationship with this girl, but he's not clear on whether they've defined their relationship status. He mentions she bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, had sex, and he's planning to see her again. So it's a serious LDR. But he's also thinking about pursuing others, which could be cheating if the relationship is monogamous. However, if the relationship isn't exclusive, maybe it's different. But the user hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries with her. \n\nThe user feels he's not an asshole, but his actions are causing internal conflict. He's afraid of hurting her if he breaks up now but doesn't see her as a long-term partner. His reasoning is that he wants experience before settling down. But is it right to keep someone in a relationship if he's not committed and plans to pursue others? That's the crux.\n\nEthically, if the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others would be cheating. Even if it's not, if there's an emotional commitment, he's leading her on. He's also not being honest about his intentions. She might believe they're in a committed relationship, while he's using her to gain experience. That's not fair to her. The user is prioritizing his own needs without considering hers, which can be seen as selfish. The fact that she's invested emotionally and he's not reciprocating with commitment makes it wrong. So the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
