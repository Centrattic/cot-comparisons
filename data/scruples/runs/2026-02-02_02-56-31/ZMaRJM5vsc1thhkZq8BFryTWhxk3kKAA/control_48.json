I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the man is still in contact with the woman, even after the relationship seemed to cool down. Then, after reconnecting, they meet up, have a good time, and she expresses love, but he doesn't reciprocate. Now he's conflicted because he's developing stronger feelings but also wants to pursue other women to gain experience for his future \"soulmate.\" He's worried about cheating if he continues the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about honesty and commitment. The woman is clearly invested, having bought a train ticket to visit him, and she's shown affection. The man, on the other hand, hasn't committed to a monogamous relationship and is considering pursuing others. Even if the relationship is long-distance, if there's an understanding of exclusivity, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust. However, if the relationship was never formally defined as exclusive, maybe his intentions aren't wrong. But from the way the story is told, it sounds like the woman sees him as a significant other, especially after meeting in person and having an emotional connection. The man's fear of developing deeper feelings might be a red flag, as he's not being transparent about his intentions. Also, his plan to pursue other women while maintaining this relationship is a form of emotional manipulation. He's leading her on without being honest, which is unethical. Therefore, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being truthful and is using the relationship for experience rather than committing to it.\n"
