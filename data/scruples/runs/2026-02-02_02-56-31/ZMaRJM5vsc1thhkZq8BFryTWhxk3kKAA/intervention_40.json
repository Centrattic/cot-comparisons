  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They had a connection, met up, and things were great. Now, he's feeling conflicted because he's afraid his feelings might grow too strong, which could lead to an inevitable breakup that would hurt her. He also wants to date other girls to gain experience for his future relationship, but he's worried about cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of honesty in relationships. The user hasn't been clear about his intentions. If he's not committed to a monogamous relationship, then maintaining a relationship while pursuing others could be considered deceptive. The girl might believe that the relationship is exclusive, which would make his actions dishonest.\n\nSecond, emotional manipulation. He's using her affection while knowing he doesn't reciprocate the same level of commitment. By not being upfront about his plans to date others, he's putting her in a position where she could get hurt later. That's a red flag.\n\nThird, the user's justification for wanting to date others is to prepare for the \"one.\" However, this is a bit of a self-centered reason and doesn't take into account the girl's feelings. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration, which he might be lacking here.\n\nHe also mentions that he's worried about breaking up with her because it would hurt her. But keeping her in a situation where he's not fully committed is arguably more harmful in the long run. It's manipulative to maintain a relationship under false pretenses, even if the intention is to avoid immediate hurt.\n\nThe key issue is whether he's being transparent. If he's not, then he's in the wrong. The user's actions are causing potential emotional harm without his partner's consent to the terms of the relationship. That's a breach of trust and respect.\n"
