  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. First, I need to understand the scenario.\n\nThe guy met someone online, she got attached quickly. He pulled back because he felt scared of her feelings. They reconnected months later, met in person, had a good time, and she confessed love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. They plan to see each other again. Now he feels his feelings are growing and is worried about commitment. He wants to keep her around but also pursue others, without cheating. He's afraid of breaking her heart if he ends it now.\n\nSo, the key points are: he's in a long-distance relationship that's becoming more serious, but he's not ready for a committed relationship. He's also considering pursuing others, which could lead to cheating. The question is whether that makes him the asshole.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, honesty and consent are crucial. If the current relationship isn't exclusive, then pursuing others might be okay. But if it's implied or agreed to be monogamous, then pursuing others without disclosure would be a problem. The user hasn't mentioned discussing exclusivity with the girl. She's in love, and he hasn't reciprocated, which might mean the relationship isn't on solid ground. By not being clear about his intentions and possibly leading her on while considering others, he might be being deceptive. Even if he's not cheating yet, the plan to pursue others while in a relationship could be seen as disingenuous, especially if he's not upfront about it. The girl might feel betrayed if she assumes exclusivity. Also, the fact that he's using her as a \"practice\" for future relationships shows a lack of respect for her feelings. Leading someone to believe there's potential for more when he's not committed could be harmful. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong because he's not being transparent and is using the relationship without full honesty.\n"
