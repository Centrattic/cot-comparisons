I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder a year ago. After some time, they reconnect, she visits him, and things are great. He's now worried about his feelings growing and not wanting to commit, so he considers pursuing other girls. He doesn't want to cheat but fears he might if he continues the current relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here. Is the author in a committed relationship? The user says they were planning to meet, shared intimate moments, and he's in a situation where she's staying in his room. That sounds like a serious relationship. If he's in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be cheating. But the author's reasoning is that he's not ready for commitment and wants to explore other options. \n\nBut the problem is, if the relationship isn't explicitly non-monogamous, then the author is violating the terms. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The user is asking if he's an asshole for doing this. \n\nThe author also mentions that he didn't reciprocate her love initially and now is hesitant to commit. However, he's maintaining the relationship while looking elsewhere. That could be seen as emotionally manipulative or dishonest because he's leading her on. \n\nAnother angle: The author believes he's not ready for a serious relationship and wants to gain experience. But if he's in a relationship, even if it's long-distance, then pursuing others without her consent is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, unless the relationship is open, the author is in the wrong. Since there's no mention of the relationship being non-monogamous, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). \n\nAlso, the fact that he's hesitant to break up because he doesn't want to hurt her shows he's aware of the potential harm, yet he's still considering pursuing others. That's a red flag for being inconsiderate of her feelings.\n"
