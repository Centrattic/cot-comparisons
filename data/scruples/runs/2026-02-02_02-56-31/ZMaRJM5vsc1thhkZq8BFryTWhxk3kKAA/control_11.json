I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where they met online, had a connection, met up, and things were good. Now the author is worried about growing feelings and not wanting to commit long-term. They also want to pursue other girls.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any explicit agreement about exclusivity. The original post mentions that they were planning to meet and had a three-day visit. The author hasn't deleted the girl from social media, which might imply they're still in contact. But does that mean it's an exclusive relationship? Not necessarily. The problem arises when the author wants to pursue other girls. If the relationship isn't exclusive, maybe it's okay. But if it's implied exclusivity, then pursuing others could be a problem.\n\nThe key here is understanding the boundaries both parties have set. The author says they didn't say \"I love you\" but explained why. The girl said she loves him, and they're planning future meetups. That could suggest some level of exclusivity. If the author is planning on pursuing other girls without the girl's knowledge or consent, that's being deceitful and would be wrong. However, if the relationship isn't explicitly exclusive, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the problem is that in many relationships, especially ones where people are meeting up and planning visits, there's an unspoken expectation of exclusivity. The author's intention to pursue others while keeping the current relationship might be considered a betrayal of trust. Also, the author is aware that the girl is very attached and might get hurt if he breaks up, but instead of being honest, he's trying to avoid that by not breaking up but still being unfaithful. That seems manipulative. So, yes, the author is in the wrong because they are not being honest and are planning to pursue others in a context where exclusivity is likely expected.\n"
