I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is 22 and in a long-distance relationship that started via Tinder. The girl became very attached quickly, which made him uncomfortable. He pulled back, but later reconnected and things got serious. They met up, had a good time, and she expressed love, but he didn't reciprocate. Now, he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure to commit, so he wants to maintain this relationship while also pursuing others. His reasoning is that he wants experience to prepare for a future serious relationship.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the dynamics of the relationship. The author mentions that the girl has a boyfriend at some point during the ten months, which he thought she still had when he reached out again. But he later connected with her again, leading to a meet-up. Now he's torn between his feelings and not wanting to hurt her if he breaks up. He also wants to pursue other girls but doesn't want to cheat.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, long-distance relationships require a lot of trust and communication. If he's not committed to her and is already planning to pursue others while in the relationship, that's a problem. Even if he's not physically cheating, emotionally investing in others while in a relationship is generally considered cheating. The girl has emotional needs and has expressed love, so if he's not willing to commit and is looking elsewhere, that's being dishonest and could be manipulative. The author is aware of his intentions but is trying to justify them by thinking he's not an asshole. However, his actions are leading the girl on, which is unethical. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
