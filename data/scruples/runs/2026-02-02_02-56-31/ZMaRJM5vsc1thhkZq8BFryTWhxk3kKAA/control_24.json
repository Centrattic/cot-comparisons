I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author started a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. She became very attached, but he wasn't sure about his feelings. After some time, they reconnected, met in person, and things were great. Now, after she left, he's feeling conflicted. He doesn't want to break her heart but also feels the need to explore other relationships to avoid cheating in the future.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is in a committed relationship (they met in person, had sex, and planned visits), but he's not entirely sure about his feelings. He's also considering pursuing other girls to gain experience before finding a long-term partner. However, he's worried about cheating and doesn't want to hurt his current partner.\n\nThe main issue is whether maintaining a relationship while pursuing others is ethical. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then it's okay. But if it's supposed to be a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be a problem. The author didn't mention if they discussed exclusivity. The fact that he bought a train ticket and they had a physical relationship might imply some level of exclusivity. If he's not honest with her about his intentions to explore other relationships, that's a problem. The author is in a position where he's emotionally involved but not committed to a monogamous relationship, which could lead to emotional harm for the girl. Since he values her feelings but isn't ready to commit, it's possible he's in the wrong for not being upfront and potentially leading her on.\n"
