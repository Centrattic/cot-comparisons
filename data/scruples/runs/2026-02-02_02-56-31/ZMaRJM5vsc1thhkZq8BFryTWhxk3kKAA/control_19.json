I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the guy is still seeing other girls and might be avoiding commitment.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The guy met a girl online, she became attached, he pulled away because he was scared. Then after a while, they reconnect, she says she loves him, they meet up, have a good time, and now he's conflicted. He wants to maintain the relationship but also pursue others because he's trying to gain experience for his future partner. He doesn't want to cheat but feels he might if he stays in this situation.\n\nThe key points here are communication and honesty. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. But the user didn't mention if he told her about his intentions. If he hasn't set boundaries, then he's being dishonest. Also, he's using her for experience without intending to be committed, which could be manipulative.\n\nHe mentions he's not ready to commit and wants to build up experience. That's his reasoning, but if he's leading her on with affection and intimacy without being transparent about his plans to see others, that's deceitful. The fact that he's not breaking up with her but still pursuing others might be emotionally abusive. \n\nThe girl is clearly invested, as she traveled to see him and expressed love. He's aware that breaking up would hurt her, but he's choosing to keep her in a situation where he's not fully committed. That's a red flag. The ethical thing would be to either be honest about his intentions from the start or to end things if he's not able to commit exclusively. \n\nSo, based on that, the author is in the wrong because he's being dishonest and manipulating the relationship without clear communication, which is harming the other person's feelings. Answer A.\n"
