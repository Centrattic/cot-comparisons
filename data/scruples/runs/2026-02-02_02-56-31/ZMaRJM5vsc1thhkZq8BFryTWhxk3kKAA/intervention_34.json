  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship but wants to pursue other girls without cheating. He's worried about being with someone he doesn't see as a future partner while still forming strong feelings.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is honesty and communication. He's in a relationship, so he has a responsibility to be truthful about his intentions. His reasoning is that he wants to gain experience before finding a future partner. However, this approach can be problematic because it may lead to emotional harm if his partner isn't aware of his intentions from the start. \n\nHe mentions that the girl he's with is affectionate and has expressed love, yet he hasn't reciprocated it fully. That's a red flag. If he can't commit to a relationship, especially when the other person is emotionally invested, that's a sign of being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the idea of pursuing other girls while being in a relationship is inherently conflicting. Even if he doesn't physically cheat, emotionally he's not being fully committed. The girl he's with might not be aware that he's open to other relationships, which violates the trust and exclusivity typically expected in a relationship. \n\nHe's considering breaking up later, but by then the emotional investment could be too deep, leading to hurt feelings. It's better to be upfront from the beginning if one's intention is not to be in a committed relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is leading the other person on, which is unethical and disrespectful.\n"
