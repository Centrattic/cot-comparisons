I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is having doubts and also considering pursuing other girls.\n\nFirst, the basics: the guy is 22 and in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They've been talking for a year, met up for three days, had a good time, and she's really into him. He's worried that if they continue, his feelings might grow too much and cause problems. He also mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls before settling down with a future partner. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to hurt her if he breaks up, but he fears he might cheat if he stays. \n\nNow, the key points here. The relationship is long-distance, which can be challenging. The girl is very affectionate and has expressed love for him. He didn't reciprocate the love initially but didn't end it either. They met up, spent time together, and things were great. The guy now feels pressure because of her feelings and his own uncertainty about the future. He wants to explore other relationships while maintaining this one, which is the crux of the problem.\n\nIn most ethical standards, being in a committed relationship (even if not formalized) and pursuing others can be considered a breach of trust. The question is whether this relationship is monogamous by mutual agreement. The original post doesn't mention if they discussed exclusivity. The guy seems to be in a position where he's not fully committed but is leading her on. If he's not willing to commit, but is allowing her to fall in love with him, that's a problem because he's not being honest about his intentions. \n\nHe's also not breaking things off, which could cause her emotional harm, but he's not entirely truthful either. His motivation is fear of commitment and a desire to gather experience, which isn't a valid reason to keep a relationship going if it's not honest. The girl is investing emotionally in a relationship that may not be sustainable for him, and he's not giving her clear signals. This could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate because he's keeping her in limbo.\n\nAdditionally, wanting to pursue other relationships without being upfront about it is a red flag. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others is a violation. Even if it's not formal, the girl's affection and his actions (like meeting up, sleeping together) imply a level of exclusivity. His plan is to \"gain experience\" while not hurting her, but that's a selfish approach. The right thing would be to have an honest conversation about his intentions and either commit or end things to avoid leading her on.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest with his partner about his intentions and is allowing the relationship to continue in a way that could lead to emotional harm for her. Answer A.\n"
