  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I keep my maintain long distance relationship and also pursue other girls?\nLONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other girls. The main question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the relationship started via Tinder, evolved into a long-distance one. He didn't reciprocate her love initially but now they're meeting, having an intimate connection. He's worried about his growing feelings but also wants to explore other relationships. \n\nHe mentions his philosophy that he wants experience before finding his \"one.\" That suggests he's not committed to this relationship long-term. However, he's in a physical relationship with her, and she's clearly invested. The problem arises if he's being deceptive or dishonest. If he's not upfront about his intentions, that's an issue. Cheating is a red flag, but he says he doesn't want to cheat. \n\nThe key point is honesty. If he's in a monogamous relationship and plans to pursue others without her knowledge, that's deceitful. But if they've agreed it's open or non-monogamous, then maybe it's okay. The scenario doesn't indicate any agreement about exclusivity. The user hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries, so pursuing others without her consent would be cheating. \n\nAlso, considering her feelings: she's been through a past boyfriend and is now very attached. If he's going to end it, he should be honest now rather than dragging it out. The pressure he feels might stem from his own fear of commitment, not hers. \n\nIn conclusion, if he's engaging in a monogamous relationship without disclosing his intentions to pursue others, he's in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). If there was an open agreement, then B. But based on the info given, no such agreement exists.\n"
