I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 22, in a long-distance relationship that started via Tinder. The girl was very attached early on, which made him uncomfortable. He gave her the cold shoulder, then later reconnected after some time. They met up, had a good time, and she expressed love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. They plan to meet again, but he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure to commit. Now, he's conflicted because he wants to enjoy the relationship but also pursue other girls to gain experience for his future relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship and the author's intentions. The original relationship wasn't formal; they met online, he was hesitant, and he never confirmed a committed relationship. However, after reconnecting and meeting in person, the relationship seems to have deepened. The author is now considering pursuing other women, which could be seen as emotionally unavailable or deceptive if the other woman believes they're in a monogamous relationship.\n\nThe problem is whether there's a mutual understanding of exclusivity. If the author never established that the relationship is non-exclusive, then pursuing others could be misleading. The original post mentions she bought a train ticket, stayed in his room, had sex, and he's planning to see her again. All these actions might imply a level of commitment, even if he didn't formally label it as such. If she believes they're in a committed relationship, then the author is in the wrong for not being honest about his intentions. However, if the relationship was open from the start, then maybe not. But given that the author is conflicted about cheating, it's likely that the relationship is supposed to be monogamous. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for leading her on and not being transparent about his desire to pursue others while maintaining the relationship.\n"
