I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering moving out and leaving the responsibility of the new baby sister to his mother. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is in a tough spot. His dad left when he was 3, his mom is making him take on parental responsibilities because she's quitting her job due to pregnancy. They had an argument where the author tried to reason with her about the financial strain. The mom then had an abortion but later changed her mind, used the author's money for baby items without permission, and now is accusing him of being selfish. The author is considering moving out to focus on his education and his own life.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's financial decisions, the author's attempts to help but feeling taken advantage of, and his desire to move out for his own well-being. \n\nThe author's actions seem to stem from a place of self-preservation. He's already stretched thin with school, work, and their current financial situation. The mom's behavior\u2014using his money without consent and then changing her decision\u2014has probably led to his frustration. Moving out could be a way to avoid being burdened further and to take control of his future.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, family dynamics are complex. While he has responsibilities as a sibling, he's not a legal parent. The mother is the one who made the choice to have the baby and then to quit her job, which directly affects their ability to support the child. The author is trying to manage his own life and education, which are important for his future. \n\nHis decision to move out isn't about abandoning his sister but about prioritizing his own stability and well-being, especially given the mother's unreliable behavior. He's already contributed as much as he could, and the mother's actions have made it clear she might not be able to handle her responsibilities. \n\nIn terms of rights and responsibilities, the author isn't legally obligated to support the child. The mother is the one who chose to have the baby, and it's her responsibility. The author's move to set boundaries is understandable. So, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
