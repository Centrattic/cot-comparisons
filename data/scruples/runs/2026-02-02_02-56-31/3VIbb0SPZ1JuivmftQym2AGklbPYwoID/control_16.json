I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to help his sister and moving out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's mom is pregnant, and she initially decides to have an abortion but then changes her mind. The author helped pay for the abortion but found out his mom used the money for baby items instead. Now, the mom is expecting him to help raise the baby, but he's struggling financially and academically. He's planning to move out to focus on his education and support himself.\n\nSo, the key points here are the financial burden, the mom's decision-making, and the author's responsibility. The author is concerned about his own future and can't handle the added responsibility of a sibling. He's already working and in school, with a less-than-ideal GPA. Moving out might help him focus better. \n\nI should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once he's 18, he isn't obligated to support his sister. Parents have the responsibility, not the children. The mom is making decisions without considering the family's financial stability. The author might feel betrayed because his mom used his money for baby items after he helped with the abortion. \n\nEmotionally, the author is under a lot of stress. The mom's actions have caused him to lose trust. Moving out could be a way to gain independence and reduce conflict. However, some might argue that he's abandoning his family, but given the circumstances, it's about his well-being too. \n\nThe mom's boyfriend situation also adds to the instability. She's making decisions that affect the whole family without consulting properly. The author's decision to move out is about self-preservation. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's taking responsibility for his own life and future. The mom has the legal duty as a parent, and the author isn't obligated to help. Plus, his actions are driven by necessity, not selfishness, even though his sister called him selfish.\n"
