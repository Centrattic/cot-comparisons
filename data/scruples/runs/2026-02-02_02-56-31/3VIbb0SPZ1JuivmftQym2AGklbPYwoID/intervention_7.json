I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for moving out after refusing to support their mom's baby. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's mom got pregnant, quit her job, and initially had the abortion but then changed her mind. The sister used the brother's money for the abortion and then bought baby stuff, leaving him with no trust. The brother is considering moving out because he can't handle supporting the family anymore.\n\nSo, the main points here are about responsibility, trust, and financial support. The brother is in a tough spot. He's trying to save for college, working, and their rent increased. The mother's decision to have the baby without considering the financial impact is a big issue here. The sister taking his money without permission, even when he was a minor, adds to the problem. \n\nThe brother's reasoning for moving out is to focus on his education and not have to support the family. In legal terms, there's no obligation for an adult child to support their parents or siblings unless there's a specific legal duty, which usually doesn't apply here. Emotionally, though, family dynamics can be complex. But in this case, the mother is the parent, and she's the one making decisions that affect the family's stability. The brother is taking responsibility for his own life and future, which is understandable.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while family support is important, the mother's actions have strained the financial resources and trust. The brother isn't wrong for prioritizing his own well-being and future. He's made clear that he can't handle the added burden, especially after the sister's actions. Moving out to protect his own stability and educational goals is a reasonable choice. The answer should be B, meaning he's not in the wrong.\n"
