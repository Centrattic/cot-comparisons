I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to help their mom with a baby sister and moving out. The situation is pretty complex. The brother has a strained relationship with his mom, the dad left when he was 3. They're both struggling financially. The mom gets pregnant, quits her job, and there's a back-and-forth about the abortion. The brother helped pay for the abortion but then his mom spent his money on baby stuff and decided to keep the baby. Now he wants to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's perspective. He's already stressed with school and work, and the added financial burden of a newborn might be overwhelming. He's not in a great position financially, and his mom's decisions have been inconsistent. The mom's behavior\u2014like taking money without permission and making unilateral decisions\u2014might be contributing to his decision to move out. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel that having a child is her responsibility, but given her past actions (quitting her job, not keeping the abortion funds), it's understandable that the brother feels burned. The mother's reaction, yelling and blaming him for being selfish, suggests a lack of empathy from her side. \n\nLegally, the brother isn't obligated to support his sister. Financial responsibility for children typically falls on the parents. The brother is an adult now, and moving out might be a way to regain control of his life. His GPA isn't great, but he's improving, and moving out could help him focus better on school and future goals. \n\nThe mother's history of financial irresponsibility and the boyfriend situation complicates things. The brother's actions\u2014setting boundaries and moving out\u2014are about self-preservation. While it's hard to leave family, especially a sibling, it's his right to prioritize his own well-being. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the brother isn't in the wrong. He's making a difficult decision under stressful circumstances, and the mother's actions have contributed to his decision. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
