I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether their friend is in the wrong for refusing to support their sister and moving out. The situation is pretty complicated, so I need to consider various factors.\n\nFirst, the family dynamics. The mom and dad split when the friend was 3, and the dad left. Now the mom is pregnant with another child, but she's unemployed and the boyfriend is not supportive. The friend is working, saving for college, and their GPA is low but improving. The mom initially wanted to abort but then decided to keep the baby after using the friend's money for the abortion and then buying baby items. The friend feels the mom is taking advantage and can't trust her anymore. They're considering moving out to focus on their education and financial independence.\n\nLegal aspects: The friend is 18 and has moved their money to a separate account. The mom can't access it anymore. The friend isn't a legal guardian of the baby, so they don't have a legal obligation to support the sibling. However, in some places, there might be family responsibilities, but generally, siblings aren't legally required to support each other's children.\n\nEmotional and ethical considerations. The friend feels overwhelmed and has a right to prioritize their own well-being. They've been helping in the past, but now the mom is acting irresponsibly, using their money without consent. The mom's argument that it's the friend's responsibility as a big brother is more of an emotional appeal rather than a justification. The friend isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially since they can't afford to support another child. Moving out to focus on their future is a valid choice, even if it's tough emotionally.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the friend should support their family, but given the mom's actions and the friend's financial instability, it's a reasonable decision. The friend isn't abandoning the sibling entirely but is taking steps to ensure their own stability. It's a matter of personal responsibility versus family duty in a situation where the parent isn't acting responsibly.\n\nConclusion: The friend is not in the wrong. They're making a difficult but necessary choice to protect their own future and well-being. The correct answer is B.\n"
