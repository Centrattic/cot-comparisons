I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong if they move out after refusing to support their sister. The situation is pretty complicated. \n\nFirst, the mom and dad divorced when the user was young. The user is helping support the family financially, making more than their mom, and even paying for her abortion when she initially decided to have it. But then the mom changed her mind and kept the baby, spending the user's money on baby items. The user also mentions the mom previously taking small amounts from their joint account when they were a minor. Now that the user is 18, they've moved their money to a separate account and want to move out to focus on school and work less.\n\nThe main points here are the user's responsibility towards their family versus their own well-being and goals. The mom's actions have created financial strain, and the user is trying to protect their future. The sister is not mentioned here, but the user is a big brother, and the mom is trying to make him feel responsible.\n\nLegally, in the US, parents are responsible for their children until they're adults, but the user is an adult now. The user is not legally obligated to support their mother or sister beyond what they choose. However, morally, there's a gray area. The user helped with the abortion cost, but the mom spent it on baby items, which is a betrayal. The user is trying to move out to improve their education and reduce work hours, which is a personal goal.\n\nThe user's actions seem more about self-preservation. They've tried reasoning with their mom but face resistance. Moving out might be necessary to avoid further conflict and financial exploitation. The mom's response was hostile, accusing the user of being selfish. The user isn't wrong for prioritizing their own future, especially when the mom has shown poor financial decisions and a lack of consideration.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The user is taking steps to protect themselves from an abusive financial situation and to focus on their education. They've done what they could to help, but the mom's actions have crossed boundaries. Moving out is a reasonable choice here.\n"
