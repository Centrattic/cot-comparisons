I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user's mom got pregnant, they couldn't afford it, she initially agreed to an abortion but then changed her mind and kept the baby. The user had to pay for the abortion only for his mom to use that money on baby stuff again. Now he's considering moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The user is supporting the family as much as he can, working, trying to improve his grades, but the financial strain is huge. His mom is quitting her job because of the pregnancy, which he can't support financially. The boyfriend left, so now the responsibility seems to fall on the user. The mom then takes his money without permission, using it for baby items after he contributed to the abortion. The user feels betrayed and overwhelmed, so he's thinking of leaving to focus on his education and independence.\n\nIs the user wrong for moving out? Well, from an emotional perspective, he's a young adult trying to take control of his life. He's not in a position to support another child, especially since he's barely getting by. The mom's actions\u2014taking money without consent and then changing her mind about the abortion\u2014show a lack of responsibility. The user's decision to move out might be a way to protect himself from being taken advantage of and to prioritize his future.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of family responsibility. However, given the mom's previous behavior and the user's efforts to contribute, moving out might be a necessary step for him. The mom's claim that it's the user's responsibility as a brother could be seen as unfair, especially since he's not a parent and is already stretched thin. The user's right to financial independence as an adult is important here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's taking steps to protect his future and well-being. The mom's actions have been irresponsible, and the user is reacting to that. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
