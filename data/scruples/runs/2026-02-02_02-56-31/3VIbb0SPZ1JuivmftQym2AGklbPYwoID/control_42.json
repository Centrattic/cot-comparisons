I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to help with his baby sister. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mom got pregnant, and he had to help pay for an abortion initially. But then she changed her mind, kept the baby, and spent his money on baby items. The author feels he can't trust her anymore and wants to move out to focus on his education and work. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, parental responsibility, and the author's own well-being. The mom is making a choice to have another child, which impacts the author's financial stability. He's already in a tough spot with his grades and job, and the added stress of supporting another family member might hinder his progress. \n\nThe mom's actions\u2014taking money without permission, quitting her job, and then changing her mind about the abortion\u2014show inconsistency. The author has legitimate concerns about being forced to take responsibility for a child he didn't choose to have. \n\nLegally, as a parent, the mother is responsible for her child, not the older sibling. The author isn't obligated to support another child unless there's a legal arrangement (like custody). Emotionally, it's a tough spot, but the author is prioritizing his future and financial stability, which is understandable. \n\nThere's no mention of the author neglecting his sister after moving out, just that he's choosing himself. Moving out is a personal decision, especially if he's able to support himself. The mother's responsibility lies with her as the parent, not the child. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are self-preservation and focusing on his own well-being, which is valid. The answer should be B.\n"
