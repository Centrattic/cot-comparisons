I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for possibly moving out and refusing to help with their baby sister. The post is from someone whose mom had an abortion but then changed her mind, used his money for baby stuff, and now he's considering moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author's mom is making big life decisions that affect him financially. She initially wanted to abort but then decided to keep the baby after taking his money. That's a big red flag. She also took money from his account before without permission, which he didn't confront because he was a minor. Now he's an adult and wants to move out to focus on his education and not be burdened financially by his mom's choices.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once he's 18, he's an adult, and his mom can't force him to support her child. She made her own choices, and if she's not working and the dad is gone, it's her responsibility. The author is trying to take control of his finances and future, which is reasonable. The mom's reaction of blaming him for being selfish doesn't make sense because he's not obligated to help. Plus, she broke her promise to abort the baby after he helped pay for the abortion, which shows she can't be trusted with such decisions.\n\nEthically, the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting boundaries for himself. He's already supporting them financially, but when the mom makes decisions that put more strain on him without considering his input, he's right to step back. The mom's insistence that it's his responsibility as a brother might be her trying to shift the blame, but siblings aren't legally or ethically obligated to support each other in this way.\n\nThe fact that he's saving for college and trying to improve his GPA shows he's focused on his future, which is important. Moving out would allow him to focus on his education without the added stress of supporting his mother's poor decisions. The mom's actions, especially using the abortion funds for baby items, were deceitful. He's justified in not trusting her anymore.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision to take care of himself and his future after being let down by his mom. The answer should be B.\n"
