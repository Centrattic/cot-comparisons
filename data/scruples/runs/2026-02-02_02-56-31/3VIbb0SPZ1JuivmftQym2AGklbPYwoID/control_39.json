I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and leave their baby sister. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider all angles carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's background: their mom isn't close to them, the dad left when they were 3. They make more than their mom but together, their income is just enough. They're struggling in school but improving and saving for college. Then the mom gets pregnant, quits her job, leading to financial strain. The author helps pay for an abortion with $675, but the mom uses the money for baby items and changes her mind about the abortion. The mom then accuses the author of being selfish when he doesn't want to support the baby, and he wants to move out.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they can't handle the responsibility of supporting the family anymore, especially with the mom's unpredictable decisions. They feel their mom is unreliable and might dump parenting duties on them. They want to focus on their own education and future.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong here. Legally, the parent is responsible for the child, so the author isn't obligated to support the baby. The mom made the decision to keep the baby despite the author's financial help for the abortion. The author's move to protect their own finances and future seems reasonable. The mom's actions\u2014like draining the account and making emotional demands\u2014add stress. The author's right to self-determination, especially after becoming an adult, is a key point. Moving out could be a responsible choice to avoid being trapped in a financially unstable and emotionally abusive environment.\n\nBut there's a human aspect too. The baby is innocent, but the author isn't the parent. The mom's choices are her responsibility. The author's decision to move out is about their own well-being and future, not abandoning the family entirely. They've already contributed financially when possible, but now they're prioritizing their own needs. \n\nPossible counterarguments: maybe the author should feel responsible as a sibling. However, unless the author is the legal guardian, they don't have a legal obligation. Morally, it's a gray area, but the author isn't at fault for wanting to protect their resources and mental health. The mom's actions have been irresponsible, so the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice to take control of their life, especially after the mom's repeated poor decisions. The answer should be B.\n"
