I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out after this situation. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author is an older brother whose dad left when he was 3. He's not super close with his mom, and they both make just enough money to get by. He's currently in school with a 2.5 GPA, working after school, and trying to save for college. Then, the rent goes up, and he takes a better job. Around the same time, his mom announces her pregnancy and quits her job, which makes them both angry. He argues that they can't afford for her to quit, and his mom's boyfriend also doesn't support the pregnancy. The mom then decides to abort, but the author had to pay for it. However, the mom takes the $400 from his account and spends it on baby items, then changes her mind and decides to keep the baby, yelling at him and saying he's selfish for not trusting her with money. The author is now considering moving out because he feels the burden is too much.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. He's in a tough financial situation, working to support himself and his mom, with a challenging GPA. The mom's decision to have a baby without considering their financial stability adds stress. He tried to reason with her, pointing out their inability to support another child, and she took his money without consent. He's using his own savings to move out, which he might see as a way to protect his future and education. His mom is manipulating the situation, first taking his money for the abortion and then spending it on baby items, which shows a lack of responsibility. The author feels taken advantage of and is trying to set boundaries.\n\nNow, from the mom's side, she's pregnant and might feel pressured to have support from her family. Her initial decision to abort might have been influenced by the boyfriend's pressure, but then she changed her mind. She might believe that as an older sibling, the author has a responsibility to help. However, the author has already had issues with her taking money without permission, which is a problem. The mom's reaction of screaming and accusing him of selfishness could be seen as invalidating his concerns, especially since she didn't follow through on the initial agreement to abort when he helped with the money.\n\nLegally, once the author turned 18, he's an adult and can decide to move out. Financially, the mom's actions have been irresponsible, taking his money without consent. The author is prioritizing his education and future, which is understandable. The mom's insistence on having the baby despite clear financial strains and her track record of mismanaging funds is a significant factor here.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is also concerning, pressuring her to abort, which might indicate an unhealthy relationship. The author's initial anger and argument might have been confrontational, but his reasoning was based on practical concerns. The mom then violates the trust by using the money given for the abortion on baby items, which is a betrayal.\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the author is trying to protect his own interests and future. Moving out to avoid being a financial burden and to focus on education seems justified. The mom is not acting responsibly, and the author has a right to set boundaries. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
