I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to help their baby sister and moving out. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the background: The person's dad left when they were 3. They and their mom are barely making ends meet. The mom got pregnant, the boyfriend wanted her to abort, she insisted on keeping it, but then the boyfriend left. The person tried to reason with the mom, helped pay for an abortion, but the mom used the money for baby stuff and changed her mind. Then the mom accused the person of being selfish. Now the person wants to move out to focus on their education and not support the sister.\n\nHmm. The key points here are financial responsibility, family obligations, and personal well-being. The person is struggling with their GPA, working to support the household, and now an unexpected child could add more stress. The mother's actions seem to be making things harder, especially since she used the son's money without consent and then changed her mind about the abortion.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the son is trying to take care of himself and his future. The mother's decisions are impacting him negatively. By moving out, he's prioritizing his stability and education. The mother's argument that it's his responsibility as a brother might be a stretch, especially if there's no legal obligation and he's not being forced to contribute. The fact that he's already supporting them both financially and now a new sibling could be a burden he's not equipped to handle.\n\nHowever, family dynamics are tricky. The son might be seen as abandoning his family, but considering the mother's past behavior (using his money without permission, changing decisions), maybe it's a form of self-preservation. The mother's actions don't exactly promote trust or responsibility, so the son's decision might be justified. \n\nI should also consider if there are any responsibilities he has. If the mother is unable or unwilling to take care of the child, maybe the son feels pressured to help. But in this case, the mother is quitting her job, which exacerbates the financial strain. The son is already overextending himself, and moving out could be a way to regain control of his life.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the son's actions seem more about self-care and trying to secure his future. The mother's decisions have put them in a difficult position, and the son isn't in the wrong for wanting to move out to focus on his education and financial independence. The answer would be B, he's not in the wrong."
