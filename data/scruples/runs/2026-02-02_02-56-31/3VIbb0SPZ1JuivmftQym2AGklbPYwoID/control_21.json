I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for wanting to move out and refuse responsibility for his sister. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author's mom is pregnant again when they can barely make ends meet. The mom initially agrees to an abortion after the author helps pay for it, but then changes her mind and uses his money for baby items. The author has a poor relationship with his mom, his dad left when he was young, and he's struggling with school and work. He's saving for college and feels overwhelmed by the added responsibility of a sibling. \n\nHe's taken steps to protect his money, like moving it to a separate account after turning 18. Now, the mom is angry, accusing him of being selfish. He's considering moving out to focus on his future.\n\nSo, the question is about whether his decision to move out is wrong. The possible angles here include family responsibility, personal well-being, and legal/ethical considerations. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as an adult, he's not obligated to support his mother's child. Ethically, while family support is often expected, it's not a given. The mother made decisions that impacted the author's financial stability without his consent. The author has his own goals and is trying to secure his future. \n\nThe mother's actions\u2014changing her mind about the abortion, using his money against his wishes\u2014could be seen as irresponsible. The author's desire to move out to manage his own life and avoid being burdened by his sister isn't inherently wrong. He's not abandoning them entirely; he's setting boundaries to protect himself. \n\nHowever, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral responsibility. But considering the context\u2014his mother's history of poor decisions, his own struggles, and the financial strain\u2014it's reasonable for him to prioritize his needs. \n\nIn summary, while there's a case for family responsibility, the author's actions are a response to years of stress and financial manipulation. His move to secure his future isn't unjust. Therefore, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
