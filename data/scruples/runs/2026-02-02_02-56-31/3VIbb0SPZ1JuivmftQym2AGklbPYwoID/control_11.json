I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to take care of his baby sister.\n\nFirst, the situation: The mom is pregnant and decides to abort after the brother helps pay for it, but then she keeps the baby without telling him. She uses his money for baby stuff. The brother had a joint account with her before, but when he turned 18, he moved his money to his own account. Now, the mom is yelling at him for not supporting the baby, and he's considering moving out.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, autonomy, and the parent's decisions. The brother is already struggling financially, working to support himself and his mom. The mom made a decision to keep the baby after an abortion, which was a big financial burden. She also took money from his account without permission before, which shows a pattern of behavior he's not comfortable with.\n\nHe's trying to save for college and improve his grades. Moving out would let him focus on his education and work without the added stress of supporting a newborn. From a moral standpoint, while he's a brother, parents are supposed to be the primary caregivers. The mom is the parent, not him. If she's making choices that harm their financial stability and then dumping the responsibility on him, it's understandable he wants out.\n\nAlso, the brother isn't in a good position financially. His GPA isn't great, but he's improving. He's supporting the household already. The mom's actions have been inconsistent and self-centered. The brother's decision to move out is about protecting his own future and well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the brother isn't in the wrong. He's trying to take control of his life and make the best of a difficult situation. The mom's choices have led to this, and he's not obligated to sacrifice his future for her mistakes.\n"
