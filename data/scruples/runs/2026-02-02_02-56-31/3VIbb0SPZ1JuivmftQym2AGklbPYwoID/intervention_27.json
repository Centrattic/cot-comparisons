I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to support their baby sister and moving out. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the family's financial situation is tight. The person makes more than their mom, but together they're just getting by. The mom recently got pregnant, which added stress. They helped pay for an abortion, but the mom changed her mind again and kept the baby. She even spent the money from their joint account on baby stuff without asking. The user is frustrated because they don't trust their mom with their money anymore and feel like they're being forced to take on more responsibility.\n\nNow, when considering if they're in the wrong, it's important to look at their age and circumstances. They're 18, an adult, and have the means to move out. They've tried to reason with their mom about the financial burden and the trust issues. The mom's actions\u2014like using the money without permission and blaming her son for being selfish\u2014might justify the son stepping back. \n\nLegally, once someone is 18, they're responsible for their own actions. The mom's financial decisions shouldn't be the son's responsibility unless he's a legal guardian, which he isn't. Also, the son is focusing on his education and future, which is a valid priority. The mom's threats and lack of accountability might be pushing him to take this step. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of family responsibility. But in this case, the son has made his position clear, tried to help when possible, and now feels it's necessary to protect his own future. Moving out doesn't make him wrong, especially since he's not obligated to support his siblings beyond what he's willing to do voluntarily. The mother's poor decisions shouldn't force him into a life of financial burden beyond his control. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong).\n"
