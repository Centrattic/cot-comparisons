I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author's mom getting pregnant again after the author has already helped her with an abortion. The mom then started spending his money on baby items and now the author wants to move out to avoid being stuck with the responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The dad left when the author was 3, so the family has been struggling financially. The author is working and contributing, but his mom just quit her job, which adds to their financial strain. The mom's boyfriend wanted her to abort but she decided to keep the baby, and now she's using the author's money without permission. The author feels he can't trust her anymore and wants to move out to focus on his future.\n\nThe author's main arguments are that he can't support the family financially anymore, especially with the new baby, and he wants to prioritize his education and career. He's also been dealing with his mom's poor financial decisions, like draining his account for baby stuff after he helped with the abortion costs.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is making a choice about her body and her child, which is her right. However, the author is not legally obligated to support another child unless he's the legal guardian or has agreed to it. The mom's actions, like using his money without consent, seem problematic. The author is also trying to take responsibility for his own future, which is understandable, especially given the previous history of financial mismanagement.\n\nThe ethical part is tricky. While the mom has her own rights, the author's responsibility isn't absolute. He's not the legal parent, and moving out to avoid being financially exploited isn't necessarily wrong. He's trying to protect his future, especially since the mom has shown a pattern of making decisions that affect him without considering his input or financial stability.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to move out. He's taking steps to secure his own future and avoid being burdened by his mother's choices. The mom's actions have been irresponsible, and the author is trying to set boundaries. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
