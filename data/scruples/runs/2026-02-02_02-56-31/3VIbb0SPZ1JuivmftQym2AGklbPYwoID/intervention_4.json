I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to move out and refuse responsibility for their sister, given the situation.\n\nFirst, the context is that their mom is pregnant, had an unstable relationship, and then changed her mind about the abortion, using the brother's money. The brother feels he can't trust his mom with his finances anymore and wants to move out to focus on his education and work.\n\nSo, from the brother's perspective, he's already struggling financially, working to support the household, and now with the rent increase, he took on a better job. The mom's decision to get pregnant again when she can't work, and then switching to keeping the baby after using his money, adds to the stress. The mother is acting like it's the brother's responsibility to help raise the baby, which he doesn't want to do.\n\nHe's trying to save for college and improve his GPA. Moving out would give him more control over his finances and time for school. He's also been a victim of his mom taking his money before, especially when he was a minor. Now that he's 18, he's taking steps to secure his own financial independence.\n\nThe key here is whether the brother is in the wrong by moving out. Legally, once he's 18, he's an adult and can make his own decisions about where to live. Emotionally, he's trying to avoid being a parent himself and focus on his future. His mom's actions\u2014like taking his money without permission and then expecting him to help\u2014seem to be adding to the burden.\n\nBut culturally and socially, there's an expectation for siblings to support each other. However, the brother's situation shows that he's already under a lot of stress and the mother is not managing the situation responsibly. He's not refusing help out of selfishness but because he can't trust her and can't handle the additional responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the brother is justified in wanting to move out. He's trying to take control of his own life and future, which is important for his personal development. His mom's inability to manage the situation responsibly is a significant factor here. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
