I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The main question is whether he's justified in refusing to help his baby sister and moving out.\n\nFirst, the situation: His mom had an abortion but then changed her mind and kept the baby. She spent his money on baby stuff without permission. The author has been trying to manage their finances since they're barely getting by. His mom is unemployed and his dad left when he was 3. He's working a job, making more than his mom, but together they're just barely making ends meet. He's also dealing with his own school performance and saving for college. \n\nHe withdrew money from a joint account when he turned 18 and moved it to his own account. His mom then accused him of being selfish when he refused to help with the baby. He feels he can't trust her anymore and wants to move out to focus on his own future.\n\nNow, considering family responsibilities. In many cultures, there's an expectation of supporting family, especially siblings. But this depends on the situation. The author is already stretched thin financially and academically. His mom's irresponsible behavior\u2014changing her mind on the abortion, spending his money without consent\u2014adds to his stress. He's trying to take control of his own finances for his future, which is understandable.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, he's the one making an effort to save and work, while his mom is the one being financially irresponsible. The mother is the parent, so the primary responsibility lies with her. The author isn't legally obligated to support the baby, especially since he's not the father or the parent. If moving out allows him to focus on his education and future, which he's already struggling with, that's a valid reason. \n\nHis mom's actions, like taking his money without permission and then blaming him, show a lack of accountability. The author is trying to protect his resources for his own goals. While there's a cultural idea of family support, in this case, the mother isn't fulfilling her role as a parent, so the burden shouldn't fall on the child. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Choosing to move out is a personal decision to prioritize his own well-being and future, especially given the mother's lack of responsibility. The answer should be B.\n"
