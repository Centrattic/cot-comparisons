I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out after his mom had a baby. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's dad left when he was 3. His mom and he aren't very close. They're both working to get by, but their rent increased, so he had to find a better job. Then his mom announced she was pregnant and quitting her job. The author was angry because they couldn't afford another child. His mom's boyfriend tried to convince her to abort but left when she refused. The author helped pay for the abortion but then found out his mom used his money for baby items instead of the abortion. She changed her mind about the abortion and decided to keep the baby. The author tried to protect his money after turning 18 by moving it to a separate account. Now, he's considering moving out because he doesn't trust his mom and wants to focus on school.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by moving out. Let's break down the factors. Financial responsibility is a big part here. The author contributed to the abortion cost, which his mom then used for baby items without permission. This shows a lack of trust and responsibility from his mom. By moving out, he's taking steps to secure his own future and education, which he's working on improving. He's also in a position where he can afford to move out now. \n\nOn the other hand, he's his mom's child, and she might feel abandoned, especially with a new baby. But the author's main concerns are about financial stability and his education. He's not avoiding responsibility entirely; he's trying to take control of his own life. His mom's actions in misusing his money and making decisions without considering their financial situation could justify his decision to move out. \n\nI think in this context, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to protect his resources and his future. The mother's actions have been erratic, and the author has a right to prioritize his own needs. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
