I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who's considering moving out because their mom got pregnant, had an abortion, then decided to keep the baby, and there's some financial issues and arguments.\n\nFirst, the user is the older brother. He's not super close with his mom, and their financial situation is tight. The mom quits her job when she gets pregnant, which adds to the stress. The boyfriend wanted an abortion but the mom insisted on keeping the baby, then later changed her mind again after using his money. The mom took his money without permission, and now he's thinking of moving out to focus on his education and not have to support her and the baby.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to move out. Let's break it down. \n\nIn many cultures, family support is important, but people also have their own responsibilities. The brother is trying to save for college and his grades aren't great. If he's moving out to focus on his education, that could be seen as a responsible choice for himself. However, by moving out, he's leaving his mom and sister in a situation where they might need more help. \n\nBut wait, the mom already took his money without asking, and he's had to support them financially. He might feel he can't trust her anymore. Also, he's an adult now (turned 18) and has the means to move out. Parents aren't legally obligated to support adult children, and vice versa, unless there's a specific legal responsibility. Since he's 18+, his responsibility isn't automatic. \n\nThe mom's argument is that it's his responsibility as a big brother to help, but legally and in many cases, siblings aren't responsible for each other's care unless there's a legal guardianship. So the brother isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to take on that role, especially if he's been taken advantage of in the past. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family should support each other, even in tough times. But in this case, the brother is also setting boundaries after being disrespected and having his money misused. He's prioritizing his own future, which is understandable. \n\nSo the key points are: his financial situation, his own goals (education), his trust issues with his mom, and his age. Since he's an adult and can support himself, moving out might be a valid choice. The mom's decision to have a baby without considering the financial impact and her past actions (taking his money) contribute to his decision. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's taking control of his life and setting boundaries after being mistreated, which is a reasonable choice for his own well-being and future.\n"
