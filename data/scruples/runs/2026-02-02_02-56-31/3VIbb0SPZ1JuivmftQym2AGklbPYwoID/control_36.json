I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to support his baby sister.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mom is pregnant but initially decides to have an abortion, which the author helps fund. Then she changes her mind, keeps the baby, and uses the author's money for baby items. The author feels his mom is financially unreliable and untrustworthy, especially after previous instances where she took his money. He wants to move out to focus on his education and not be responsible for the new baby.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The author is an adult now (18), has his own income, and wants to prioritize his future. The mother's decision to have the baby after using his funds and her past behavior of taking money without consent might justify his decision. He's not trying to abandon responsibility entirely but is setting boundaries to protect his own well-being and future.\n\nThe mother's argument that it's the author's responsibility as a big brother is a bit questionable because parental responsibilities primarily lie with the parents, not the children. The author isn't being selfish if he's setting reasonable limits, especially given the mother's financial instability.\n\nAlso, the author has already taken steps to secure his finances by moving money to an account she can't access. Moving out could be a way to ensure he's not financially drained further. His GPA is improving, and he's working towards college, which is important for his future.\n\nHowever, there's a line where family responsibilities come in. But in this case, the mother's actions (using his money without consent, changing decisions) have contributed to his decision. The author isn't refusing to help entirely but is prioritizing his own stability.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a choice to protect his future and avoid being taken advantage of, which is a valid decision given the circumstances.\n"
