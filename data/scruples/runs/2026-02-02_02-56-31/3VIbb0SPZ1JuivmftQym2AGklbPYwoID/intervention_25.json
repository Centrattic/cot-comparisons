I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong for refusing to help with the baby and moving out. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe user is a brother who's not particularly close to his mom. His dad left when he was 3, so he's been dealing with the responsibilities for a long time. He's working and trying to go to school with a 2.5 GPA, which isn't great but he's improving. Their rent increased, so he had to get a better job. His mom announced she was pregnant, quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\" That's when things got tense. The brother and his mom were angry because they can't afford to support another child. The mom's boyfriend was pressuring her to abort, but she insisted on keeping the baby. The boyfriend left after she decided to abort, but then she changed her mind again, used the money he gave her for the abortion to buy baby stuff, and now he's upset.\n\nHe tried to reason with her, but she blamed him for being selfish. Now he feels he can't trust her with money anymore and wants to move out to focus on his education and work. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, looking at family responsibilities. The mom is the parent, so in an ideal world, she should be the one handling the baby's needs. However, she's making decisions that are financially irresponsible. She changed her mind about the abortion, used the brother's money for baby stuff, and now is demanding he help. The brother is in a tough spot because he's trying to take care of himself and his future. He's working, studying, and trying to save for college. Taking on the responsibility of a baby would set him back.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, is he responsible for the baby? The mother is the legal guardian, so the brother isn't obligated. He's not a parent, so his decision to move out isn't necessarily wrong. However, there's a cultural expectation sometimes that family should help each other. But in this case, the mother isn't being responsible, so the brother might be protecting himself. The mother's actions (using his money, changing her mind) show a lack of responsibility, which justifies him stepping back.\n\nHe also mentions he has enough to move out. Financial independence in this situation is a valid choice, especially if the environment is toxic or unstable. He's trying to better his own life, which is understandable. Moving out isn't selfish; it's about self-preservation and future goals.\n\nHowever, there's the argument that family should support each other. But when that support is being forced and the parent isn't taking responsibility, it's a different scenario. The mother's behavior is contributing to the brother's decision. He's not refusing to help because he's unkind, but because he can't trust her and can't afford to be responsible for the baby.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the brother is not in the wrong. He's making a hard choice to protect his own future and well-being. The mother's actions have left him with no good options, and moving out is a reasonable response.\n"
