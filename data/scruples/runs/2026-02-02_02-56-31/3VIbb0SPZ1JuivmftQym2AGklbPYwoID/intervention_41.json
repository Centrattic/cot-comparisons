I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if their friend is in the wrong for refusing to support their sister and moving out. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the family's financial situation is tight. The mom and her son are making just enough to get by. The son is trying to work, go to school, and save for college. The mom got pregnant, which added stress. She wanted to quit her job, but the boyfriend wanted an abortion. They ended up getting the abortion, but the mom used the son's money for baby items and then decided to keep the baby. This made the son lose trust in her.\n\nThe son is considering moving out to focus on his education and not have to support his sister anymore. The mom is blaming him for being selfish. The key points here are the financial strain, the mom's decisions affecting their stability, and the son's need to prioritize his future.\n\nSo, is the son in the wrong? Well, in terms of legal responsibility, parents are typically responsible for their children. But the son isn't a legal guardian here. He's trying to protect his own future and financial stability. The mom's actions, like using his money without permission and making unilateral decisions, don't help. The son moving out to take care of himself seems reasonable under the circumstances. There's no clear legal obligation for him to support the baby, especially with the trust issues. Emotionally, it's a tough spot, but given the context, he's not in the wrong.\n"
