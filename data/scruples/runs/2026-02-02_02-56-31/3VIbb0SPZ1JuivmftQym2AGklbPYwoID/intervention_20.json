I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this person is in the wrong for moving out. First, I need to understand the situation. The user is the older brother of a baby sister. Their mom is pregnant, but things got complicated. The mom initially decided to have an abortion, which they paid for, but then changed her mind and kept the baby. The brother is struggling with his own finances and education. He's making enough to support himself and his mom, but now there's a new baby coming. He's worried about not being able to handle more responsibility and wants to move out to focus on his future.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for moving out. Let's break down the key points. \n\nFirst, the brother's financial situation. He's making more than his mom, but together they're just getting by. The rent increased, so he got a better job. Then the mom got pregnant, which added more financial strain. He tried to reason with her about the abortion, and she initially agreed. But then she changed her mind and spent the abortion money on baby items. This shows a lack of trust and financial irresponsibility from the mom. \n\nThe brother had previously taken steps to protect his money when he turned 18, which suggests he was trying to avoid similar issues. The mom now is dumping the parenting responsibility on him, which he can't handle. He feels moving out is necessary for his own well-being and future. \n\nLegally, as a grown adult, he's not obligated to support his family financially. Once he's 18, his responsibility isn't to his parents. The mom's actions, like taking his money without permission and the sudden change of plan, might have contributed to his decision. \n\nEmotionally, the brother is under a lot of stress. His mom isn't in a stable position, especially with the boyfriend situation and the financial strain. The brother's main concern is his education and improving his life. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family support is important, and as an older sibling, he has a moral duty to help. But given the mom's history of financial mismanagement and the brother's own struggles, it's a tough call. \n\nI think the brother isn't in the wrong. He's trying to take control of his life and future. The mom's actions, like using the abortion funds for baby items and the lack of communication, show poor judgment. The brother had valid reasons to move out to focus on his education and stability. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
