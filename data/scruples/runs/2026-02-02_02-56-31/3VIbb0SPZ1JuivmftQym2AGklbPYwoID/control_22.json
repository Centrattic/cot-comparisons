I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong for refusing to help raise their baby sister and moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author's mom is pregnant, which causes financial strain. She initially decides to abort but then changes her mind and uses the author's money for baby items. The author has a history of the mom taking small amounts from their joint account. Now, the author wants to move out to focus on their education and not be responsible for the baby.\n\nLegally, the author isn't a parent, so they aren't obligated to support the baby. The mom is the legal parent, so she's responsible. The author is trying to take control of their finances and future by moving out, which is their right. The mom's actions\u2014using the author's money without permission\u2014show a lack of trust. The author's decision to move out could be seen as self-preservation, especially since they're struggling with school and work.\n\nEmotionally, the author is under stress from school, work, and family issues. They're trying to improve their GPA and save for college. The mom's sudden decision to keep the baby after using the author's money might be seen as selfish or irresponsible. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial support they've already provided.\n\nSocietally, while there's a cultural expectation for siblings to help, it's not a legal requirement. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs, especially since they're not the legal guardian. The mom's inability to manage her finances and responsibilities reflects more on her than the author's choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice to secure their future and protect their finances when the parent is unreliable. Moving out is a reasonable decision under these circumstances.\n"
