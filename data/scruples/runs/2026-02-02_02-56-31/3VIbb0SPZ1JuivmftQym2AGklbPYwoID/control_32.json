I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is that the author's mom got pregnant, but they can't afford it, and after he helped pay for an abortion, she changed her mind and kept the baby, using his money. Now he's considering moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is supporting his mom financially because they can't make ends meet. When the mom decided to keep the baby after initially aborting, she used his saved money for baby items. The author feels he can't trust her anymore and wants to move out to focus on his education and not take on more responsibility.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author is not a legal guardian, so the responsibility for the child primarily falls on the mother. The author is already struggling financially and with school. The mom's actions\u2014changing her mind, using his money without permission\u2014are problematic. The author's decision to move out is about taking care of his own future and not being burdened further by his mother's decisions.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, family responsibilities can be complex, but the author isn't legally obligated to support his sister. His mom made choices that impacted their finances negatively. The author is prioritizing his education and independence, which is understandable. The mom's behavior seems to be taking advantage of his financial support. The author's move to establish independence isn't necessarily selfish; it's about self-preservation and his future.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be about family duty, but the author isn't the parent. The mother is the one who made poor decisions. The author's right to his own life and financial stability should be considered. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
