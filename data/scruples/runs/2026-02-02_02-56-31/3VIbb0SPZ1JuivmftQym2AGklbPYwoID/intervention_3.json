I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the situation is wrong for wanting to move out. Let me start by reading through their story again carefully.\n\nThe user's mom is pregnant with another child, the baby sister. The user, who's the older brother, isn't close to his mom, and their dad left when he was 3. He makes more than his mom but together they're just getting by. He's struggling in school with a 2.5 GPA but improving. He works after school, which leaves him too tired to study. They had a rent increase, so he got a better job. Then his mom announced her pregnancy and decided to quit her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\" He and his mom were angry. The boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but the mom insisted on keeping the baby. The boyfriend left. The user convinced her to abort, which cost $800, and he contributed $675, but she drained his account and spent it on baby items, then changed her mind and kept the baby. She's taken money from his account before, and when he turned 18, he moved his money to a separate account. Now the mom is yelling at him for not trusting her and dumping the parenting responsibility on him. He wants to move out to focus on his education and work less.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong by moving out. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: He's 18, so legally an adult. In most places, once you're 18, you can leave your parents' home without their permission. So legally, he's not in the wrong. But the question is about moral or ethical wrongness.\n\nMoral considerations: He's been helping financially, even when it was against his will. His mom made promises but broke them, like using his money for abortion and then baby items. She took money without consent before. He's concerned about being responsible for the baby, which he can't handle. He's trying to focus on school and his future. Moving out could give him the independence he needs to succeed academically and financially.\n\nArguments against him moving out: Some might say he has a duty as a brother to support his family, especially the baby. That he should help his mom during this time. But his mom's actions have been inconsistent and self-centered. She's not been a reliable parent, and he's the one trying to manage the household financially. His dad left, and his mom's decisions have added to the burden.\n\nAlso, he mentions she's not close to his mom, which might indicate that their relationship is strained. If moving out helps him focus on his education and future, which is his current priority, it could be seen as a responsible decision. He's saving for college, which is important for his future. The stress of supporting a family might hinder his academic progress.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is claiming it's his responsibility as a brother. But in many cultures, siblings aren't obligated to support each other financially unless there's a specific agreement. Since he's an adult, he's not legally required to support the baby. His decision to move out is about self-preservation and his own goals.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's broken promises, her taking money without consent, and the user's need to prioritize his future. So, considering all these factors, he's not in the wrong for wanting to move out. It's a personal choice to focus on his well-being and future, especially given the circumstances.\n"
