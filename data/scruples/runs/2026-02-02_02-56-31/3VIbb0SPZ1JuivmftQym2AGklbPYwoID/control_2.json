I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out after a conflict with their mom about her pregnancy. The situation is pretty complicated. The author's mom was planning to quit her job, but then the boyfriend wanted her to abort. The author helped pay for the abortion, but the mom used the money for baby stuff and changed her mind. Now she's angry and says it's the author's responsibility to help. The author feels they can't handle being responsible and wants to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points here are about parental responsibility, the author's own financial situation, and the mom's actions. \n\nThe mom is making a big life decision that affects her son, who is 18. He's trying to save for college and work. She asked him to help with the abortion, then used his money for baby items, which is a breach of trust. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially since they're an adult now. Moving out to focus on education and their own life might be seen as necessary. The mom's reaction seems unfair, as it's her choice to have a baby, but she can't force her son to support it. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the son should still support his family, even if the mom isn't trustworthy. But given the history of her taking money without permission and the current situation where she's being dumped on him, it's reasonable for him to prioritize his own needs. Also, the author is not in a position to financially support another child, and the mom's actions have been inconsistent and irresponsible. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking steps to manage their own life and finances after being mistreated.\n"
