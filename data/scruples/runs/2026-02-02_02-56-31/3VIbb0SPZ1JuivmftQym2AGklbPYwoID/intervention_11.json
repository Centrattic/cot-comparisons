I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong for moving out after the events described. Let me start by breaking down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is a young adult who lives with their mother and has a baby sister. Their father left when they were three, so the family's financial situation is already strained. The user is working and going to school, trying to improve their GPA and save for college. The mother had a pregnancy scare, and instead of keeping the job, she considered quitting. The user tried to reason with her, leading to arguments. The mother then had an abortion, but later changed her mind, used the user's money meant for the abortion, bought baby items, and now claims the baby is being kept. The user feels their mother is irresponsible, uses their money without consent, and now expects them to take responsibility for the baby. The user is considering moving out to focus on their education and independence.\n\nSo the key points here are the financial responsibility, the mother's decision-making, the user's need for personal stability, and the conflict over parental duties.\n\nThe user's mom made multiple decisions that impacted the user's financial stability. She initially considered quitting her job, which would have increased the financial burden on the user. Then, after the abortion was paid for with the user's money, she changed her mind, used that money for baby items, and now expects the user to help care for the baby. The user has already taken steps to separate their finances once they turned 18, which is understandable as they are an adult now.\n\nThe user's argument for moving out is based on the need to take care of their own future, education, and financial independence. They feel that staying would mean being stuck in a cycle of financial and emotional strain. From an ethical standpoint, while the mother might feel entitled to support as a parent, the user has their own responsibilities and life goals. The mother's actions have been financially irresponsible, including using the user's money without permission and changing her mind about the abortion, which shows a lack of reliability.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't being selfish by moving out. They are prioritizing their own well-being and future. The mother's demands are unreasonable given the circumstances. The user isn't abandoning the sister entirely; they're just removing themselves from the situation to focus on their own growth. So the answer would be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
