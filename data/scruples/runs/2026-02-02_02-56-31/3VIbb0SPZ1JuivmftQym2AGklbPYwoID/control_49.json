I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for considering moving out and leaving his sister to the care of his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is an older brother whose mother recently got pregnant. They already have financial struggles, and the mother initially decided to have an abortion, which the brother helped pay for. But then the mother changed her mind, kept the baby, and spent the brother's money on baby items without permission. The brother has a strained relationship with his mother, and his father left when he was young. He's also trying to focus on his education and work. Now he's considering moving out to avoid supporting the child and to focus on his own future.\n\nSo, the main points here are about responsibility, financial support, and personal boundaries. The brother is concerned that his mother will rely on him to help raise the child, which he can't handle. He has his own goals and is not in a good financial situation. The mother's actions, like taking money without consent and changing her mind about the abortion, have led to the brother's decision to move out.\n\nLegally, as the older sibling, there's no legal obligation for him to support the child unless he's a legal guardian or has taken on that responsibility. In most cases, parents are responsible for their children, not siblings. So, from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong for not wanting to support the child financially beyond what he's already done.\n\nEmotionally, the brother has been through a lot with his father leaving, financial struggles, and the mother's erratic decisions. His decision to move out could be seen as a way to take control of his life and focus on his education. However, some might argue that family support is important, but the brother has already shown support by helping with the abortion costs, and the mother's subsequent actions have broken his trust.\n\nThe key here is the mother's responsibility. If she's the parent, she should be the one to care for the child. The brother isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially after the mother's betrayal of trust by using his money without permission. He's trying to prioritize his own future, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because he's not obligated to support the child financially, and his decision to move out is a way to protect his own well-being and future. The mother's actions and the existing strained relationship justify his choice.\n"
