I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong for moving out and refusing to help with his sister. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mother is pregnant with another child, a baby sister. They already have a strained relationship; the dad left when the author was 3. The author is working and trying to save for college, has a 2.5 GPA, and the family is barely making ends meet. The mother initially wanted to have the baby but then decided to abort after the author and others convinced her. However, she used the $675 the author contributed for the abortion to buy baby stuff and changed her mind, deciding to keep the baby. The author feels betrayed because his mom took money from his account without permission before, and now he's considering moving out to focus on his education and not take on more responsibility.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for moving out. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once he's 18, he's an adult and can choose to move out if he can afford it. Financial responsibility is a factor here. The author has enough saved to move out, which suggests he's capable. The mother's actions\u2014using his money without consent and then changing her decision about the pregnancy\u2014added to his stress. \n\nEmotionally, the author is trying to prioritize his future. He's working, studying, and struggling. Adding a new sibling's needs could make things harder for him. The mother's reaction, yelling and blaming him for being selfish, indicates a lack of support from her side. \n\nEthically, the author isn't obligated to support the baby financially since he's not the father. He's not in the wrong for not wanting to take on that responsibility, especially given the mom's history of misusing funds. \n\nHowever, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral duty to help. But since the mother is the legal parent, the responsibility should fall on her. The author's main issue is with the mother's decisions and her lack of responsibility, not the sister herself. \n\nThe key points are the mother's misuse of funds, the author's financial independence, and his need to focus on his education. The author isn't abandoning a sibling but is trying to protect his own future from being derailed by circumstances beyond his control. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
