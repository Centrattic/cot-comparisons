I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for considering moving out and not helping his sister anymore.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mom got pregnant, they couldn't afford it, and she initially had an abortion. The author paid for the abortion with his savings, but then the mom changed her mind, kept the baby, and spent his money on baby items. This led to a conflict where the mom accused the author of being selfish, and he's now thinking of moving out to focus on his education and independence.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, family dynamics, and personal boundaries. The author has a strained relationship with his mom, his dad left, and he's working hard to improve his grades and save for college. He's contributing financially to the household, but the mom's decisions are impacting his ability to support himself and his future. \n\nHe's had issues with his mom accessing his funds before, and after turning 18, he moved his money to a separate account. Now, with the new baby, he's concerned about the increased financial and emotional burden. His main reasons for moving out are to focus on school, reduce work hours, and avoid being forced into parental responsibilities he didn't agree to.\n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to support his sister. As an adult, he's not required to contribute financially unless there's a legal guardianship or custody situation, which doesn't seem to be the case here. The mother is the parent, so she's responsible for her child's care. The author has done his part by helping with the abortion cost, but the mom's subsequent actions (changing her mind and spending his money) have broken his trust.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling overwhelmed. The mother's reaction of blaming him for being selfish adds to the stress. Moving out is a way to regain control over his life and priorities. While it might seem harsh, it's a personal choice about his own well-being and future.\n\nHowever, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral responsibility to help. But the story doesn't mention any prior agreements or obligations beyond what he's already done. The mother's actions in draining his savings without consent further justify his decision to set boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are about protecting his future and financial independence, especially given the parent's irresponsible behavior. So the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
