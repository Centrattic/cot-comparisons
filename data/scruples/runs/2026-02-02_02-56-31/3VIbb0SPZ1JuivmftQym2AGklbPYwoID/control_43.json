I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is an adult who's trying to manage their own life. They have a 2.5 GPA and are working part-time after school, which is tough. Their mom is pregnant with another child, and she decides to quit her job, which adds financial strain. The author tried to help pay for an abortion, but their mom spent the money on baby stuff and then decided to keep the baby. This led to a conflict where the mom is now expecting the author to step up, but they feel overwhelmed and want to move out.\n\nThe key points here are the financial responsibility and the author's right to make their own choices. The author is trying to save for college and improve their grades. If they have to support another sibling, it might jeopardize their education and future. The mom's actions\u2014draining the author's account and making unilateral decisions\u2014seem irresponsible. The author has already taken steps to protect their finances by moving money to a separate account once they turned 18, which is understandable given past issues.\n\nThe mom's reaction, yelling about it being the author's responsibility as a brother, might be seen as unfair. The author isn't a legal guardian, so they don't have a legal obligation to help. Ethically, while siblings often support each other, the author's own well-being and future are important. Moving out to focus on their education and job isn't necessarily selfish if they can afford it. The mom's previous actions (like taking money without permission) have eroded trust, so the author's decision to leave could be a way to protect themselves.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might be seen as abandoning family in a tough time. But considering the mom's poor financial decisions and the author's own struggles, it's a hard call. The author isn't at fault for setting boundaries, especially when their mom hasn't demonstrated responsibility. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
