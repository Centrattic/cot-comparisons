I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong if they refuse to support their baby sister and move out. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the brother's mom is pregnant, but she quits her job and initially decides to have an abortion, which the brother helps pay for. Then she changes her mind, keeps the baby, and spends his money on baby items without permission. The brother is struggling financially, has a low GPA but is improving, and works to support the household. He's thinking of moving out to focus on his future.\n\nSo, the key points here. The mother's actions have created a financial burden. The brother already had to help with the abortion cost, but then she used his money for baby stuff. He's tired of being taken advantage of and wants to move out. Legally, once he's an adult, he's not obligated to support his sister unless there's a legal responsibility. But culturally, there might be expectations of family support.\n\nThe brother has the means to move out, which suggests he's making a responsible decision to prioritize his own future. The mom and boyfriend's situation seems unstable. The brother's arguments about financial strain are valid. He's trying to improve his grades and save for college, which is important for his long-term goals.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of family. The mom is claiming it's the brother's responsibility as a sibling. However, in many societies, adult children aren't legally required to support their siblings financially unless there's a specific arrangement. The brother's trust in his mother has been broken, given the money misuse. Moving out could be a way to set boundaries and take control of his life.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The brother might be seen as abandoning his family in need. But considering the mother's actions\u2014like quitting her job and using his money without consent\u2014it's a form of exploitation. The brother isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect his own financial stability and future. He's already contributed by helping with the abortion, but the mother didn't respect that. So, the answer would be B\u2014No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
