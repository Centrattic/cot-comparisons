I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering moving out and leaving his sister, given the situation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's mom is pregnant, and they're struggling financially. The mother initially decides to abort the baby after the author and his sister's reasoning, but then she changes her mind and starts buying baby stuff with the author's money. The mother is unemployed, and the author is working hard to support them, even though he's not doing great in school. Now he's thinking of moving out to focus on himself.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe mother is pregnant, and the financial situation is already tight. She quits her job, which adds to the burden. The author helped pay for the abortion initially, but then his money was used for baby items when she changed her mind. The mother took money from his account without permission, and he can't trust her anymore. The author is trying to improve his grades and save for college. Moving out would allow him to focus on his education and not have to support the family, which he feels is unfair.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is a young person trying to better his own life. The mother, as a parent, should be responsible for her own decisions, but she's making choices that impact her children's lives. The author isn't in a position to support another child, and his sister is also not in a good place. The mother's actions seem to be self-centered, leading to the author's frustration. \n\nLegally, the author isn't responsible for supporting his mother's child. Parents are the ones responsible for their children. The author is an adult now and has the right to make his own decisions about his living situation. Moving out would allow him to take control of his life, which is understandable.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family responsibilities come into play, especially with a sibling. But in this case, the sister is also involved, and it's the mother's decision to have the baby. The author isn't the parent, so he isn't obligated to help raise the baby. The mother's actions (draining his savings, not respecting his financial autonomy) have contributed to his decision.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own well-being. If he moves out, he can focus on school and his future without the added stress of supporting his family's new addition. It's a way to protect himself from being taken advantage of again. \n\nOn the other hand, moving out might leave his mother and sister in a worse situation. But the author isn't in a position to help, and the mother's irresponsibility is part of the problem. The author isn't being selfish by prioritizing his own needs in this scenario, especially since he's trying to improve his life and the mother isn't acting responsibly.\n\nI think the key here is the mother's behavior and the author's right to make his own choices once he's an adult. The author isn't wrong for wanting to focus on himself when the family's circumstances are beyond his control. So the answer should be B (No), he isn't in the wrong.\n"
