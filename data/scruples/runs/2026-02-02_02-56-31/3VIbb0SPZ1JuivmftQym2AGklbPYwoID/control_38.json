I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is considering moving out because their mom had a pregnancy and then changed her mind, leading to financial strain. He's contributing money for an abortion but she spent it on baby items and now wants to keep the baby. He's also had issues with her taking his money before. The key points here are his responsibility as a sibling, his financial situation, and his mom's decision-making.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that he can't support his mom's decision to keep the baby, given their financial instability. He's already contributing to the abortion but then she spent the money on baby stuff. That's a betrayal of trust. He's trying to save for college and work, so moving out makes sense for his personal growth and financial independence.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Legally, he's not obligated to support his sister. Parents are responsible for their children, but siblings aren't. His mom is an adult, and while the baby is her choice, there's a cultural expectation in some families for older siblings to help. However, the author has been taken advantage of before, both financially and emotionally. His mom's actions\u2014taking money without permission, making last-minute decisions about the pregnancy\u2014show poor judgment.\n\nThe author's decision to move out is about his own well-being and future. He's not abandoning his sister; he's setting boundaries after being mistreated. The mom's response was to blame him for being selfish, but the author is prioritizing his own needs, which is understandable given the circumstances. There's no legal obligation, and he's had to take steps to protect his finances from her past behavior.\n\nSo while some might argue he should help, morally, he's not in the wrong. He's trying to take control of his life and escape a toxic dynamic. The answer is B.\n"
