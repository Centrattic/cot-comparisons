I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their baby sister and moving out. The situation is pretty complex. The author has a strained relationship with their mom, their dad left when they were young. They make more than their mom, but together they can barely get by. The author is struggling in school with a 2.5 GPA but trying to improve and save for college.\n\nThen the mom gets pregnant, quits her job because it's \"not good for the baby,\" which the author and their mom's boyfriend are upset about. The author argues that they can't afford to support another child without the mom working. The boyfriend threatens to leave unless she aborts, but she insists on keeping the baby. The boyfriend leaves, and the author had some money to help with the abortion but the mom used it all on baby items instead and decided to keep the baby. Now the author feels like the mom is shirking her responsibilities and pushing them to take over, so they want to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral responsibilities. The author is an adult now, 18, so legally, they aren't obligated to support their mother or siblings. In many places, once you're 18, you're considered an adult and not responsible for your parents' choices. The mom's actions seem to be a big part of this problem. She had a history of taking the author's money, even when they were a minor with a joint account. The author tried to help with the abortion but the mom didn't follow through and instead used the funds for baby items, then changed her mind. The author is now feeling like they can't trust her with their money and their own future is at stake.\n\nThe mom's argument that it's the author's responsibility as a big brother to help raise the baby is questionable because the author is not financially responsible for their siblings. The situation is also made worse by the mom's past behavior of taking money without permission. The author's main concern is their education and ability to support themselves without being burdened by their mother's poor decisions. Moving out could give them the independence they need to improve their GPA and college prospects.\n\nHowever, there might be a cultural or family expectation angle. In some cultures, adult children are expected to help their parents, but the user didn't mention that. The mom seems to be acting irresponsibly by quitting her job after the pregnancy announcement, which exacerbates the financial strain. The author isn't in a position to take on another dependent, especially with their own struggles. Legally, the author isn't obligated to support the baby, but the mother is. So the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own needs and future.\n\nAlso, the mom's actions of draining the account and then expecting the author to help are problematic. The author had to take steps to protect their own finances, which is reasonable. The emotional aspect is tough, but the author is making a choice that's in their best interest. The boyfriend's threats and the mom's subsequent change of mind add to the instability.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to prioritize their own life and future, especially after the mother's previous behavior. Moving out seems like a valid decision here.\n"
