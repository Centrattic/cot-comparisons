I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering moving out and not helping their mother with her new baby. \n\nFirst, the family situation is pretty complicated. The user's dad left when they were 3, and they have a strained relationship with their mom. They're working and trying to study, with a 2.5 GPA. They're also saving for college. The rent increased, and the mom decided to have a baby after quitting her job, which caused financial strain. The user contributed money for an abortion, but the mom used it for baby items and then decided to keep the baby.\n\nThe user's main concerns are financial and their ability to focus on education. They feel the mom can't be trusted with their money and doesn't consider their financial limits. They want to move out to reduce stress and focus on their future.\n\nNow, considering family responsibilities. In many cultures, there's an expectation to support family, but it's also important to set boundaries, especially when someone's actions are harmful or self-centered. The user is in a tough spot, balancing their own needs with family obligations. \n\nThe mom's actions seem to ignore the user's financial contributions and the initial agreement about the abortion. Using the user's money for baby items after they agreed to the abortion is a breach of trust. The user's decision to move out can be seen as self-preservation, allowing them to pursue education and stability without being overwhelmed by family responsibilities.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family support. The mom might feel that the user should help, especially as a sibling. But the user's situation shows that they've tried to reason with the mom and have been exploited before. Moving out might be necessary to protect their own future.\n\nLegally, once someone is an adult, they have the right to make their own decisions about residence and financial independence. Emotionally, it's a hard choice, but it's understandable given the circumstances. The user isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their well-being and future, especially after the mom's previous actions. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
