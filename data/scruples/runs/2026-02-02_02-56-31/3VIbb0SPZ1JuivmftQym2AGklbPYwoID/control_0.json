I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and refuse helping with his baby sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom got pregnant, and they can't afford another child. The boyfriend wanted an abortion but left. The mom initially decided to have the abortion but then changed her mind, using the author's money for baby items. The author had to contribute money, which was then misused. The mom is now angry, blaming the author for being selfish. The author feels he can't handle being a parent and wants to move out.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's supporting his mom and sister, but the mom isn't respecting his financial boundaries or making responsible decisions. He's tried to reason with her, but she's not listening. His main concern is his future\u2014education and not being burdened with a child he didn't ask for. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, he isn't a parent, so he doesn't have a duty to support the baby. Morally, maybe people would argue that family should help each other. But the mom's actions have been irresponsible, using his money without permission, and now expecting him to take responsibility. He's trying to take control of his life after years of instability with his dad leaving and his mom's poor decisions.\n\nOn Reddit threads like this, often the community supports the person trying to focus on their own future when the family isn't being responsible. The author is an adult now, has his own money, and moving out is a way to protect himself from further exploitation. His mom's behavior is manipulative and self-centered. The key points are that he's not the parent, the money was his, and he's making a choice for his own well-being. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
