I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) would be in the wrong if he refuses to help his mother with her baby and moves out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom had an abortion but then changed her mind. She used his money for baby items, and now he's considering moving out. The mother is unemployed and the father left when he was 3. They make just enough to get by, and the author is trying to save for college. The mom is now pregnant again and expects him to help as the big brother.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, family obligations, and personal well-being. The mother has a history of making poor financial decisions, like taking money from the joint account without permission. The author has been the one supporting the family financially, and now with the mom quitting her job and having another child, he's overwhelmed.\n\nHe's also dealing with his own school and work balance. His grades are not great, but he's trying to improve. Moving out would allow him to focus on his education and not have to support his family's financial needs anymore. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is expecting him to take responsibility as a brother. But the author feels that he can't trust her with his money and that she's not capable of handling another child. Also, the boyfriend situation was chaotic, leading to the abortion and then the reversal, which shows instability.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to take control of his life and his future. He's been the financial backbone for the family, and now with the new baby, the pressure is too much. Moving out is a way to regain his independence and focus on his education. The mother's actions, like using his money without permission, show that she's not responsible with his resources. The author is protecting himself from being taken advantage of again. \n\nAlso, while there's an expectation of family support, the mother isn't contributing financially, and the author is already stretched thin. His decision to move out is about his own well-being and future, which is valid. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
