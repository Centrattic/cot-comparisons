I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for refusing to take care of their baby sister and moving out. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the family's financial situation is tight. The author makes more than their mom, but together they just barely get by. The author is in school with a 2.5 GPA, which isn't great but improving. They work after school, so they're already stretched thin. Then there's the rent increase leading to the author finding a better job. \n\nMom gets pregnant, quits her job, which adds more financial strain. The boyfriend threatens to leave unless she aborts the baby, but the mom insists on keeping it. The author tries to reason with her, pointing out the financial difficulties. The mom decides to abort but then changes her mind, uses the author's money for baby items, and gets angry when the author stops trusting her with their money. Now the author wants to move out to focus on school and not take on the parental role.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider their perspective. They're a teenager, already struggling with school and work, and suddenly there's a new sibling. The mom is unreliable, using their money without permission, and now the author feels burdened. Moving out seems like an escape from the financial stress and to focus on their future. \n\nFrom the mom's side, she's a parent who made a decision to have the baby, and the author is her child, so she might expect help. But the author isn't legally obligated to support a sibling. In many places, parents are responsible for their children's support, but siblings aren't. The author is an adult now, just turned 18, so they can make their own choices.\n\nThe mom's actions also play a role. She used the author's money without consent, which is a breach of trust. The author had to create a separate account to prevent further misuse. The mom's reaction\u2014yelling and blaming the author\u2014doesn't help the situation. \n\nLegally, the author isn't responsible for the sibling. Emotionally, the author is under a lot of stress. Moving out to focus on their education and independence isn't necessarily selfish if they're not in a position to help. The author is trying to protect their future and well-being. \n\nHowever, there's a moral aspect. Even if not legally required, some might argue the author has a moral duty to help their family. But given the mom's actions and the author's own struggles, it's understandable they want to prioritize themselves.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author's financial contributions, the mom's irresponsible behavior, the author's own needs for education and stability, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They're making a tough choice to focus on their life when they can't handle the additional burden.\n"
