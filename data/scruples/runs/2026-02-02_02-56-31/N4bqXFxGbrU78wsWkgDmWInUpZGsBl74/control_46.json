We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend about her period. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been living together for three months. The girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, especially during the first two days. The author planned a special date night, but on that day, she started her period and canceled. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she should make more effort. She reacted extremely, calling him names and crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and he feels she's not making an effort. He's upset because he planned this special evening weeks in advance. But when he comments on her behavior compared to other women, it backfires badly.\n\nNow, considering period-related issues. It's a common experience for women to have cramps, fatigue, or other symptoms during their period. The author acknowledges that he knows this, but he's frustrated because it's affecting their plans unpredictably. However, the way he addressed it was by comparing her to other women he's lived with, which might not be fair or considerate.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author's approach seems passive-aggressive. Even if he wasn't angry, saying that other women don't act like this could come across as dismissive of her feelings. It's possible he didn't consider that her experience might be different or that she's already making an effort by staying home when she's uncomfortable. His comment might have invalidated her pain or made her feel judged.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but it's also a sign that his words really hurt her. Maybe she felt criticized or that he doesn't understand her discomfort. The fact that they haven't spoken since suggests a breakdown in communication. The author needs to reflect on whether his approach was respectful and empathetic.\n\nIn relationships, validating a partner's feelings is crucial. Even if there's a disagreement, how it's communicated matters. The author's statement about other women might have triggered her because it implied she wasn't measuring up. That could be a sensitive topic for her, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014while stemming from frustration\u2014were not handled well. He should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding, rather than making a comparative comment that could be seen as critical. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
