  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?\nFor some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for getting upset because his girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. He had a special date planned, but she canceled because she started her period that day. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act that way, implying she should make more effort. She got really angry and upset.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and understanding. Menstrual cramps can be really painful and affect people differently. The girlfriend might have legitimate physical discomfort. By comparing her reaction to other women he's known, he's potentially dismissing her feelings and pain. That could come off as invalidating, which is a big no-no in relationships. Even if he's not angry, saying it in a passive-aggressive way might have been hurtful. She felt attacked, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nBut on the other hand, he had plans he put effort into. It's natural to feel disappointed when plans are canceled, especially if they were special. However, the way he expressed his feelings compared to finding a solution might have been the issue. Instead of criticizing her, maybe he could have asked how he could support her instead of comparing her to others.\n\nI think the main mistake was the comparison and the passive-aggressive comment. That's not supportive and makes her feel like she's being judged. So, he's probably in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
