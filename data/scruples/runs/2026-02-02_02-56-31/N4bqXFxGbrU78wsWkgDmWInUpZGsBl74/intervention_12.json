We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. He set up a special date night, but she canceled because she was menstruating. He told her that other women he's known don't act like that, implying she should make more effort. She had a huge reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Menstrual cramps can be really severe for some people. It's a real medical issue, not just a phase. Even if she's usually laid-back, this might be a legitimate health issue. The user knew about her period but planned the date anyway, maybe underestimating how bad it could be. \n\nHe mentions that she cancels plans every month around her period, which seems to be a recurring issue. He's frustrated because he's had to put up with it before but this time it escalated. However, his response was to compare her to other women he's lived with, which could come off as dismissive. Comparisons like that often hurt because they imply she's not handling things as well as others. \n\nCommunication is key here. Instead of making a comparison, maybe he should have expressed his feelings without blaming her. Saying she should put in more effort might sound like he's not considering her pain. Even if he's not angry, passive-aggressive comments can be damaging. \n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. She might feel disrespected or invalidated. Menstruation is a natural process, but it's often stigmatized or misunderstood. His comment might have triggered her feelings of being judged or not supported. \n\nHe might not realize how his words were received. The key issue is empathy. Even if he's frustrated, acknowledging her pain and offering support instead of comparing her to others would be better. So, from an outsider's perspective, he might be in the wrong because he didn't validate her experience and made a hurtful comparison. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. If her period is affecting their plans frequently, maybe they need to find a middle ground. However, the way he handled it was poor. The answer likely is A (he's in the wrong) because his approach was dismissive and hurtful, even if his intent wasn't malicious."
