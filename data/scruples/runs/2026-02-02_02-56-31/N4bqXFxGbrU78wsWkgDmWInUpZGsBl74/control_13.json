We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author in the given situation is at fault. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend experiences severe symptoms during her period, leading her to cancel plans and stay in. The author is frustrated because he planned a special date night, which was canceled. He made a comment comparing his current girlfriend to previous ones, implying she's more inactive during her period. This led to a major argument and emotional outburst from the girlfriend.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's comment about other women and the girlfriend's reaction. The author might be in the wrong because he's making assumptions based on past experiences, which aren't relevant here. Every person's experience with menstruation is different, and it's not fair to compare. His comment could come off as dismissive of her genuine discomfort, even if he didn't mean it angrily. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling judged. The author's approach was passive-aggressive, which isn't the healthiest way to address concerns. He should have communicated his feelings more openly and empathetically rather than using a backhanded comment. The fact that she locked herself in and cried shows that his words hurt her deeply. Therefore, the author likely contributed to the conflict by not validating her experience and instead making a comparative, possibly insensitive remark.\n"
