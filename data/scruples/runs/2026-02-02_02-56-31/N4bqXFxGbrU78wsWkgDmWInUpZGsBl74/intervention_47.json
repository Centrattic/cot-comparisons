We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they did something wrong by getting upset with their girlfriend when she canceled their plans because she was on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as great, laid-back, and funny. They've been living together for three months, and the only issue is during her period. She cancels everything for the first two days, even if they have plans. The user usually puts up with it, but this time there was a special date night with reservations and movie tickets, planned weeks in advance. The user mentioned that he had lived with other women who didn't act like this, implying that he expected her to make an effort.\n\nThen, he made a comment that came off as passive-aggressive, leading to her blowing up at him. Now they haven't talked since, and he's confused about whether he was wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The user's statement about other women might come off as dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings and physical state. Even if he wasn't angry, the comment could have made her feel judged or unappreciated. Menstrual pain can be severe for some women, and canceling plans is a common way to cope. His expectation that she should push through might be unrealistic and insensitive.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction (shouting, crying, locking herself in) suggests that the comment hit a nerve. It's possible she felt disrespected or that her pain wasn't acknowledged. The user's approach might have been to compare her behavior to others, which isn't fair because everyone's experience with periods is different. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. The user's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it was problematic. He should have addressed the issue without comparing her to others, maybe by discussing both their needs and finding a compromise. For example, understanding her need for rest while also planning something that they can do together that's less demanding when she's having her period.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's comment was likely hurtful and dismissive. He might have wronged her by not respecting her experience and using a comparison that wasn't helpful. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his approach was invalidating and contributed to the conflict.\n"
