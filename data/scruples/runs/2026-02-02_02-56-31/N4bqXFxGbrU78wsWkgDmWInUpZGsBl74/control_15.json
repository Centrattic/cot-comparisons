We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend is being very affected by her period for the first two days, canceling plans even if they're pre-arranged. The author tried to plan a special date, but she canceled. He mentioned that other women he's lived with didn't act that way, so he felt she could put in more effort. She had a big reaction, calling him names and crying.\n\nNow, the key points here. Menstruation is a natural biological process, and it's well-known that some women experience severe cramps and discomfort. The author seems to acknowledge that she's going through something, but he's frustrated because she cancels plans. However, his comment about other women he's known suggests he's comparing his girlfriend to others, which might not be fair. He also brought up this comparison, which could have been hurtful.\n\nHe's asking if he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that his words were offensive to her. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark about other women not acting that way might have crossed a line. It's important to consider empathy here. The girlfriend is dealing with physical discomfort, and the author's comment might have invalidated her feelings. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author might have been trying to express his disappointment, but the way he did it was probably not supportive. Comparing her to others could make her feel criticized. The girlfriend's outburst and crying show that she felt hurt, which suggests that his comment was inappropriate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author had valid feelings of disappointment, the way he expressed them was unkind and dismissive of her needs. The answer is likely that he's in the wrong because he invalidated her experience and compared her to others, which can be damaging in a relationship.\n"
