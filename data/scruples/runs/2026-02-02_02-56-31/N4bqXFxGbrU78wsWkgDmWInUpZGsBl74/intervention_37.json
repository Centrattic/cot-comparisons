We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation is that she cancels plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. The user had a planned special date night, but she canceled because her period started that day. The user told her that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she should put in more effort. She got really angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional impact of what the user said. Comparing his girlfriend to other women he's lived with could be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if he's not angry, saying others don't act this way might make her feel like her pain isn't being taken seriously. Periods can be really painful for some women, and the idea that others don't cancel plans might not be accurate. It's possible that the user is making a generalization that isn't fair. \n\nAlso, the user had planned this date weeks in advance, and she knew about it. The fact that she still canceled might be because she was in too much pain. But the way the user approached it, by comparing her to others, might have been hurtful. It's important to validate someone's feelings, especially during a time when they're already feeling vulnerable. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that the user's comment was a significant trigger. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might be feeling frustrated because he's making an effort to plan special things, and they keep getting canceled. But instead of expressing his feelings in a supportive way, he used a comparison that could come off as dismissive. The key here is communication and understanding. The user could have talked to her about his feelings without invalidating her experience. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user's comment likely hurt her feelings because it implied that her pain wasn't valid compared to others. That would mean the user is in the wrong for not being supportive and for making a comparison that was unkind. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
