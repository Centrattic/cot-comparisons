We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did something wrong by getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. They set up a special date night, but she canceled it because she was on her period. He mentioned that she knew about the plans weeks in advance. He told her that other women he's lived with don't act this way, so he felt she could put in more effort for him. She had a huge reaction, yelling and crying.\n\nSo, the key points here are: He planned a special date knowing she'd be on her period. She canceled anyway. He commented that other women don't act like this, implying she's being over-dramatic. She was very upset by his comment. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're in a close relationship, living together. She's described as usually laid back and kind. The problem is recurring, but this time escalated. His comment about other women could be seen as invalidating her experience. Period symptoms can be severe and vary between individuals. Even if some women manage to go out, others can't. By comparing her to others, he might have dismissed her genuine pain.\n\nAlso, the fact that he planned the date knowing her period might come around that time could be an issue. Maybe he didn't consider that she might need rest. But he did know about her cycle and still planned it. However, she might have thought she could manage, but when it started, she couldn't. \n\nHe says he wasn't angry but passive-aggressive. The passive-aggressive comment about other women might have been a trigger. She reacted strongly not just to the cancellation but to feeling judged. His statement could have made her feel unappreciated or that her needs were being minimized for his plans. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. He might have thought he was being reasonable, but his approach was hurtful. Instead of comparing her to others, he should have discussed his feelings without invalidating hers. He could have explored ways to accommodate both their needs, like adjusting plans or offering support. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the comment about other women is problematic because it's a common issue where people dismiss others' pain by saying \"I've seen others cope worse.\" It's not about comparing who has it harder, but respecting individual experiences. By bringing up other women, he undermined her valid experience, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nTherefore, he's in the wrong because his words were hurtful and dismissive, even if his intention was to express frustration. The right approach would have been to check in with her, offer support, and maybe adjust the plans together without making her feel like her feelings are invalid.\n"
