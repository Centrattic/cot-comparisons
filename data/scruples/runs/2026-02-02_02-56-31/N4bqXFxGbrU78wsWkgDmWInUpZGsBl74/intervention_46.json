  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?\nFor some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation is that she cancels plans when she has her period, which he finds frustrating, especially since he had planned a special date night. He mentioned that she had known about the plans in advance, but she started her period that day and canceled. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, which led to her getting extremely upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is comparing his current girlfriend to other women he's lived with. That comparison might be the key issue here. Even if what he said is true, making that comparison could come off as dismissive of her feelings or invalidates her experience. Periods can be really painful and debilitating for some women, and expecting her to push through that for a date night might be unreasonable. \n\nHe says he's not angry, but passive-aggressive. Even if his tone wasn't harsh, the content of his message\u2014that other women don't act this way\u2014could make her feel like her pain isn't being taken seriously. It's possible that she feels misunderstood or that he's not empathizing with her discomfort. \n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since suggests that this was a significant emotional hit for her. Her reaction was intense, which indicates that his words might have hit a nerve. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might feel that he's being accommodating by putting up with it most of the time, but this one time he felt his efforts were disregarded. However, communication is key in relationships. Instead of making a comparison, he could have expressed his feelings about the situation and discussed how to handle future plans better. \n\nThe main issue here is not the expectation that she should go out despite her period, but the way he communicated his frustration by comparing her to others. That comparison likely made her feel like her needs and experiences were being minimized. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he invalidated her feelings and used a comparison that hurt her.\n"
