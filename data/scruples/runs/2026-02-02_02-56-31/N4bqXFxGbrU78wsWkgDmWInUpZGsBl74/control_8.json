We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend has periods that make her stay home for the first two days, which she can't control. The author planned a special date night, but she canceled because she was on her period. He expressed his frustration by saying other women he's lived with don't act like that, which made her very upset.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author mentions he's usually patient, but this time he was impatient. He compared her to other women, which could be hurtful. Even if he didn't say it angrily, the passive-aggressive comment might have made her feel criticized. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but maybe because she felt her pain and needs were being dismissed. Menstrual cramps can be severe and unpredictable, making it hard to plan. The author planned weeks ahead, but her period came at an inconvenient time. However, she might have felt he wasn't considering her health and well-being.\n\nThe author's mistake was not being understanding and making a comparison that invalidated her experience. Even if he's frustrated, how he expressed it was harmful. The girlfriend has the right to feel unwell and cancel plans without being judged. The author should have communicated better, maybe by asking how she was feeling instead of comparing her to others.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his approach lacked empathy and contributed to the conflict. He should have been more supportive rather than making her feel like she wasn't trying hard enough.\n"
