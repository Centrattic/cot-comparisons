We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out during her period, and the author expressing frustration, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which is common for many women experiencing cramps. The author planned a special date night, but the girlfriend canceled last minute because her period started. The author's comment compared his current girlfriend to other women he's lived with, implying she's not putting in enough effort. The girlfriend reacted strongly, and they haven't talked since.\n\nNow, considering general social norms. It's common for women to feel unwell during their period, and it's not uncommon for them to cancel plans. However, the author's approach was problematic. He made a comparison, which can come off as dismissive of her feelings and needs. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment might have hurt her feelings, especially since she was already in pain. The fact that she reacted so strongly suggests that his words were hurtful, even if his intent was to express frustration.\n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. Instead of making a comparison, the author should have discussed his feelings in a more supportive way. He might not be wrong for feeling frustrated, but the way he expressed it was invalidating. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a response to feeling criticized, which is understandable. The author's statement might have made her feel like her health and well-being aren't respected.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and didn't consider her feelings. Even if his intention wasn't to be mean, the impact of his words caused a significant conflict. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the comment was a major issue for her. Therefore, the author should take responsibility for how he communicated his frustration and work on a more empathetic approach.\n"
