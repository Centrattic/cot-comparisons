We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been living together for three months. The girlfriend usually doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period, canceling plans. The user usually puts up with it but once got impatient when they had a special date planned. He mentioned that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she could put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted strongly, getting angry and crying, and they haven't communicated since.\n\nNow, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Answer A or B. Let's think about the key points here.\n\n1. **Communication and Understanding**: The user knew about her period and the plans weeks in advance. However, he still expected her to go through with the plans despite her being on her period. He might not fully understand how severe her symptoms are, even though he acknowledges that periods can be tough. But his comment about other women suggests he's comparing her to others, which can be hurtful.\n\n2. **Respect and Empathy**: The girlfriend's reaction indicates that his words were deeply hurtful. Comparing her to other women in a context where she's already feeling vulnerable (due to her period) can come off as dismissive of her pain. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment might have been the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\n3. **Assumptions and Expectations**: The user expected her to put in more effort, but maybe he didn't consider her actual physical and emotional state. Periods can be debilitating for some people, and expecting them to go out despite that might be unrealistic. His frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was problematic.\n\n4. **Conflict Resolution**: The user now feels upset and doesn't know how to reconcile. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve. The user's approach to the situation\u2014making a comparison and implying she's not trying hard enough\u2014likely made her feel unappreciated and criticized during a time when she's already uncomfortable.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences and communicate without comparisons. The user's comment, even if not meant to be harsh, undermined her feelings and experiences. Therefore, he's more likely in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with the empathy and understanding needed.\n"
