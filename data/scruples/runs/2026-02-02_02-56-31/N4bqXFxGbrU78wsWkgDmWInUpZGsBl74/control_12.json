We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend experiences severe symptoms during her period's first two days, leading her to cancel plans or stay home. The author planned a special date night, but she had her period that day and canceled. The author expressed frustration, comparing her to other women he's lived with who didn't act the same. This led to a big argument where the girlfriend was upset and felt attacked.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, she's dealing with a known issue (period pain) and had communicated it. The author planned something in advance but didn't account for her cycle's unpredictability. However, when she called it off, he criticized her for not trying harder. Comparing her to other women might come off as dismissive of her pain and invalidates her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment about other women could be hurtful.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author planned something, but maybe didn't consider her physical and emotional state. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment about other women was a trigger, making her feel unappreciated or judged. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might have been inappropriate. It's important to validate her feelings rather than compare her to others.\n\nAlso, periods can vary each month, so expecting consistency might be unrealistic. The author's expectation that she should put in more effort despite her pain could be seen as not empathetic. While it's okay to want her to try, the comparison to other women undermines her individual experience. So, the main issue is the author's response and the lack of empathy in his communication. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because his approach was dismissive and hurtful, even if his intention was to express frustration.\n"
