We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been living together for three months. The girlfriend often cancels plans during her period, which the author is okay with most of the time. But in this specific instance, the author had planned a special date night weeks in advance, and the girlfriend canceled again. The author made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she could do better. The girlfriend had a strong negative reaction, leading to a fallout.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication and empathy. The author's comment about other women might have come off as dismissive or invalidating of his girlfriend's feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, passive-aggressive remarks can be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt criticized or not respected during a time when she's already uncomfortable. \n\nThe author had known about the period problem beforehand but still made plans, which could be seen as not being considerate enough. Maybe he should have discussed the plans with her again closer to the date to confirm, especially since her period is irregular. However, the girlfriend also has a responsibility to communicate her needs better if her cycle is unpredictable. \n\nBut the key point is the author's response. Comparing his current partner to others and implying she's not trying hard enough is a common mistake in relationships. It can make the other person feel unappreciated and less than. The girlfriend's emotional response is a sign that she felt attacked, which is a valid reaction. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some role. The author could have handled the situation more empathetically, and the girlfriend might need to communicate her needs more clearly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that his comment was the trigger for the argument and that he made a comparison that was hurtful, it leans towards him being at fault. \n\nSo the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The comment about other women was a poor choice of words that invalidated her experience, leading to the conflict. Even if he had a valid frustration, the way he expressed it was inappropriate.\n"
