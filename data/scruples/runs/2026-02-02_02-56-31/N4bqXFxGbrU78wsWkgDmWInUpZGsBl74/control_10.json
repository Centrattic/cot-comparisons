We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (who is the boyfriend in the scenario) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's having her period, which the boyfriend finds frustrating because he's planning ahead and she's not showing up. He made a special date night, and when she canceled, he made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act like this. The girlfriend got extremely upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the boyfriend's reaction to his girlfriend's period. He's upset that she cancels plans during her period, even though he knows it's a recurring issue. He had planned a special date, and she canceled on that day. His comment about other women not acting that way seems to be the trigger for her outburst.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication and empathy are crucial. The boyfriend might be feeling like his efforts are unappreciated or that his plans are being canceled without consideration. However, the girlfriend's health and well-being are also important. Menstrual cramps can be debilitating, and everyone's experiences vary. The boyfriend's comparison to other women could come off as invalidating her feelings.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's comment was inconsiderate or dismissive of her situation. By bringing up other women, he's implying that she's not meeting his expectations and that others don't act this way. That could be hurtful because it suggests that her feelings or physical state aren't valid. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have undermined her experience.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction was severe, but his comment might have been the catalyst. Comparing her to others in a situation where she's in pain could be seen as dismissive. The boyfriend should have considered a more empathetic approach instead of pointing out other women's behaviors as a standard. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because his comment invalidated her experience and contributed to the conflict.\n"
