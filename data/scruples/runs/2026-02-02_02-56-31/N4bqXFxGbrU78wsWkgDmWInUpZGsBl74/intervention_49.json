We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. He set up a special date night, but she canceled it because of her period. He mentioned other women he's lived with didn't act that way, which upset her a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is experiencing pain and discomfort during her period, which is a legitimate medical condition. Cramps can be severe enough to affect daily activities. It's important to validate her experience. On the other hand, the user had planned a special date weeks in advance, and felt let down because she canceled last minute.\n\nThe key issue here is communication and empathy. The user's comment about other women he's known implies that his girlfriend's behavior is abnormal or that she's not making enough effort. That can come off as dismissive of her pain. Even if it wasn't meant to be harsh, comparing her to others can invalidate her feelings. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment hurt her feelings, making her feel criticized for something she can't control. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to be supportive during times when a partner is unwell. The user's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might have been hurtful. He should have considered her condition more and maybe adjusted the plans together, rather than making a passive-aggressive remark. \n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the severity of the situation. The user needs to take responsibility for his words and approach her with empathy to apologize and understand her perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user might have felt let down, his response was inconsiderate and dismissive, which makes him at least partially at fault. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
