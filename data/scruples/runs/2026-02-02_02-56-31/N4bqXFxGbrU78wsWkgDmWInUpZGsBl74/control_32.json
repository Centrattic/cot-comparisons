We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend when she cancels plans during her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author finds frustrating. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because her period started. The author compared her to other women he's known who don't act that way, and that led to her blowing up at him.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is wrong for expressing his feelings in that way. He wasn't angry, maybe a bit passive-aggressive. But he's frustrated with the unpredictability and the cancellation. The girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014she got really upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nI need to consider cultural and social norms here. It's common for women to experience discomfort during their periods, and it's generally accepted that some might need rest. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach might have been dismissive or invalidating of her feelings. Comparing her to other women could come off as minimizing her experience, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe key point is whether the author's comment was justified. Even if he's not angry, saying that other women don't act this way implies that her reaction is excessive. This can make someone feel belittled, especially when they're already in pain or stressed. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve, possibly because she felt judged or not supported.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author might have needed to express his feelings without comparing her to others. Instead, he used a comparison that likely made her feel unappreciated. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since indicates significant damage to their communication.\n\nSo, even if the author's frustration is relatable, the way he expressed it was probably inappropriate. He should have validated her feelings first before expressing his own. The answer would likely be A, that he's in the wrong, because his approach was hurtful and dismissive, leading to a major conflict.\n"
