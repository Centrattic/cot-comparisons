We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author finds frustrating. He planned a special date night, but she bailed last minute because her period started. He made a comment about other women not acting that way, which led to a big argument.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: PMS or menstrual cramps can be severe and affect people differently. Even if the author has experience with other women, everyone's experience is unique. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that the author's comment might have hit a sensitive spot. Comparing her to others could come off as dismissive of her pain or feelings.\n\nThe author's main point is that he's upset because she's not putting in effort. But his approach was to make a passive-aggressive comment about other women. That's a common issue in relationships where one person's needs aren't being met. However, the way he communicated his frustration might have been the problem. Instead of being supportive, he criticized her, which led to her emotional outburst.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author could have expressed his feelings without comparing her to others. Saying something like, \"I feel disappointed when we cancel plans, but I understand it's important for you to rest\" might have been better. His comment about other women could have made her feel like her needs weren't valid, leading to her anger.\n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. It's possible she felt criticized and unappreciated. The author might not realize how his words affected her emotionally.\n\nSo, while the author might genuinely care and want to spend time together, his approach was flawed. He didn't consider her feelings and used a comparison that could be hurtful. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here because his communication style caused harm rather than resolving the issue.\n"
