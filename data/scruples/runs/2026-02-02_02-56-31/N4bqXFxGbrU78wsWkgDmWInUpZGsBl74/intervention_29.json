We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset because their girlfriend didn't want to go out when she was on her period. They had a planned date night, and she called it off. He mentioned that he's been with other women who didn't act like this, so he thought she could put in more effort. She got really angry, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The girlfriend is experiencing what he refers to as \"shark week,\" which I assume is a joke term for her period. He's frustrated that she cancels plans and doesn't want to do anything for two days. But he also acknowledges that other women have cramps and he usually puts up with it. Then he compares her to other women he's lived with, implying she's being more extreme. \n\nNow, the key points here are about empathy and communication. Women's experiences with periods vary a lot. Some might have mild discomfort, others severe pain. The girlfriend may be in a lot of pain that he's underestimating. By bringing up other women, he's essentially saying her experience isn't as valid, which can be hurtful. That's a red flag because it dismisses her feelings and physical state. \n\nHe planned a special date weeks in advance, and she knew about it. However, periods can be unpredictable, and she might start at a time that's inconvenient even if she tried to anticipate it. But the bigger issue is his reaction. He's frustrated because she's not meeting his expectations, and instead of expressing concern or asking how she's feeling, he passive-aggressively compares her to others. That could make her feel disrespected or not understood. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying, locking herself in. That suggests she felt deeply hurt or offended. Maybe he crossed a line by implying her behavior was abnormal or less than what he's experienced with others. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark can be damaging. \n\nHe might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective or health. Comparing her to others is a common mistake in relationships where one partner's experience is invalidated. The fact that she's usually sweet and kind, but this time blew up, shows the comment hit a nerve. He should have been supportive, maybe adjusted the plans, but instead criticized her, which isn't helpful. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong). He needs to acknowledge her pain, apologize for the remark, and work on better communication. It's important to support each other in a relationship, and using others as a benchmark isn't the way to go.\n"
