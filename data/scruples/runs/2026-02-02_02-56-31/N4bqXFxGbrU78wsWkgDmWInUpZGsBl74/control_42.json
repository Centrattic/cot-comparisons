We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset when she canceled their planned date night.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The author mentions that his girlfriend is great, but during her period, she cancels plans. He's been putting up with it except this one time when he got impatient. He planned a special date night, which she canceled because her period started. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this, even on their periods, implying she could put in more effort. She reacted extremely, calling him names and crying. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author expressed frustration about his girlfriend's behavior during her period, compared her to other women he's known, and that led to a major argument. \n\nFrom a general perspective, periods can be really uncomfortable for some people. Cramps, fatigue, mood swings\u2014these are real and can make someone not want to go out. The author acknowledges that she has cramps, so he's aware of the physical aspect. But he's frustrated because the timing is unpredictable and she cancels plans, which affects his plans. \n\nIn the specific instance, he had planned a date weeks in advance, and she canceled on the day because her period started. He said other women don't act this way. His girlfriend was clearly hurt and angry. \n\nNow, considering the communication here. Even though he said it passively-aggressively and not angrily, making a comparison to other women can be very hurtful. It implies that she's not meeting his expectations based on other experiences. It's possible that she felt he was invalidating her pain or not respecting her needs. Even if she didn't want to go out, the way he phrased his criticism might have made her feel judged or compared negatively to others. \n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since suggests she felt deeply hurt. The author might not have realized how his words affected her. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He did express frustration and made a comparison that hurt her feelings. Even if his intention was to express his own frustration about canceled plans, the way he communicated it was hurtful. He might not have considered her perspective enough and instead of understanding her pain, he focused on his own inconvenience. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. When one partner is in pain or discomfort, the other partner should support them. However, when plans are made and canceled, communication about expectations is important. But in this case, the author's comment about other women could be seen as dismissive of her situation. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his comment was hurtful and invalidated her experience, even if his intention was to express his frustration.\n"
