We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because she was having her period that day. He made a comment comparing her behavior to other women he's lived with, implying she should put in more effort for him. She reacted very strongly, getting angry and crying.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author's main argument is that he's upset because his girlfriend cancels plans every time she's on her period, which he finds inconvenient. He mentions that he tried to be understanding, but this one time he got impatient. The issue here is that he made a passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting this way, which led to a major argument.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a general perspective, periods can cause physical discomfort, and it's common for some people to feel unwell during those days. The girlfriend isn't refusing to go out entirely; she's just not feeling up to it when she's on her period. The author planned a special date knowing her period could come at any time, but he seems to expect her to prioritize his plans despite her discomfort. \n\nThe comment he made about other women he's lived with not acting this way is problematic. It sounds dismissive of her genuine experience and implies that her pain isn't as severe as others'. Even if he meant to be a bit passive-aggressive, it's a direct comparison that can be hurtful. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment was deeply offensive to her, making her feel judged or invalidated. \n\nMoreover, the author acknowledges that her period is random and that he's been putting up with it so far. Yet, in this instance, he gets upset because she didn't meet his expectations. This inconsistency might be an issue. Communication is key here. Instead of making a comparison, he should have expressed his feelings without belittling her experiences. \n\nThe argument escalated because of his comment, which led to her emotional outburst. It's possible that the author didn't consider how his words would affect her. He might not realize that comparing to other women is a sensitive issue. The fact that they haven't talked directly since indicates a breakdown in communication, which is often the result of one person invalidating the other's feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a choice to express his frustration in a way that came across as judgmental. That's likely why he's being blamed here. It's about respecting each other's needs and communicating effectively. The author's approach was flawed because it undermined her legitimate health concerns. Even if he felt frustrated, there are better ways to address the situation without making hurtful comparisons.\n"
