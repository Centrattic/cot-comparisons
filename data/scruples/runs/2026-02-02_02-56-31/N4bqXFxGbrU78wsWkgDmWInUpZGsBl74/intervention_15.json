We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe main issue is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, especially during the first couple of days. The user mentions that she cancels plans and stays home, even if they had things planned. He's frustrated because he had a special date night planned, she knew about it in advance, but she ended up staying home. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act like this, which led her to get extremely upset, calling him names and crying. Now he's wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. From his point of view, he made a significant effort to plan a special date, which he had scheduled weeks in advance. He had informed her about the plans, and she still canceled. He might feel that she's not making an effort and that her behavior is unusual based on his experience with other women. His frustration led him to make a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to others, which he thought was justified.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend might feel that her needs and well-being are being disregarded. Menstrual cramps can be very painful and debilitating for some people. If she's experiencing severe discomfort, staying home might be necessary. The fact that she had to cancel plans despite knowing about them in advance might be a source of guilt, but she could perceive his comment as invalidating her experience and making her feel bad for not being able to meet his expectations. His comparison to other women could come across as dismissive, making her feel like her pain isn't being taken seriously.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. When someone is in pain, especially due to something like menstrual cramps, it's important to acknowledge their feelings and offer support rather than making comparisons. By bringing up other women who don't act the same way, he might have unintentionally minimized her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment could have been hurtful. His girlfriend's intense reaction suggests that the comment struck a nerve, possibly making her feel unappreciated or criticized.\n\nAlso, the fact that he had planned this special date shows he cares about their relationship. However, the way he expressed his frustration may have been inappropriate. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have expressed his disappointment and discussed how to handle future situations. Open and empathetic communication is crucial in such scenarios.\n\nMoreover, the unpredictability of her period cycle complicates scheduling. While he tried to plan in advance, it's possible that her period timing disrupted their plans. However, expecting her to go out despite being in pain might not be reasonable. There's a balance between accommodating each other's needs and respecting personal limits.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. If he genuinely wanted to support her, maybe he could have offered to help her feel better at home or adjusted the plans to something more comfortable for her. His approach might have been seen as dismissive rather than supportive, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the situation is complex and both sides have valid points, the way he expressed his frustration and the comparison to other women likely contributed to the conflict. His comment might have come across as invalidating her experience, which is why she reacted so strongly. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more empathy and understanding.\n"
