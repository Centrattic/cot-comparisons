We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend cancels plans during her period, which he finds frustrating. He planned a special date, but she canceled at the last minute. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, suggesting she could put in more effort. She reacted strongly, getting angry and emotional.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author planned the date knowing her period was coming, but she canceled anyway. He might feel his efforts were disregarded. However, PMS or period symptoms can be severe for some women, and it's a medical fact that some people experience significant discomfort. The author's comment about other women could be seen as dismissive of her experience. He might not realize that every woman's experience with periods is different. His passive-aggressive remark might have crossed a line, even if he wasn't angry. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment hurt her feelings, making her feel criticized. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach might have been insensitive. Instead of expressing frustration, he could have discussed his feelings without comparing her to others. His comment could be perceived as invalidating her needs. Even if his intentions were to encourage effort, the way he phrased it was likely hurtful. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he made a judgmental remark that didn't consider her perspective and triggered a strong emotional reaction. The answer should be A.\n"
