  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?\nFor some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset because their girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the user's girlfriend cancels plans during her period, which is the third or fourth day. He's usually understanding, but this time he got impatient after planning a special date. He mentioned that other women he's known don't act this way and that she could put in more effort. She was upset and angry, leading to a fight.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective: periods can be really painful and unpredictable. Even if she knew about the plans, her period came on that day, maybe causing her pain. The user's argument is that he's put effort into the plans and feels she's not trying hard enough.\n\nBut, comparing her to other women might not be fair. Every woman experiences periods differently. What's normal for one might not be for another. The user's comment about other women could come off as dismissive of her pain or feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, saying others don't act like that implies she's being overly dramatic compared to others, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe user's intention was probably to express frustration, but the way he did it might have invalidated her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt disrespected or misunderstood. It's possible she felt he wasn't taking her pain seriously, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user might have expected her to push through discomfort, but not everyone can or wants to. It's important to validate each other's experiences. The user's comment about others could make her feel like she's failing as a partner, which is why she was so upset.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might be in the wrong because his comment dismissed her valid feelings and compared her to others in a way that's hurtful. He should have found a way to express his frustration without undermining her experience.\n"
