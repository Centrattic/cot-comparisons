We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period, cancels plans, and the author is upset because he planned a special date night. He told her that other women he's lived with don't act this way, implying she should put in more effort. She had a strong negative reaction, yelling and crying.\n\nSo, the main points here are about expectations during menstruation and communication. The author is frustrated because he planned something special and she canceled because of her period. He's comparing her to other women, which might not be fair. \n\nFrom what I know, menstrual cramps can be very painful and affect people differently. Some people might feel too unwell to go out, even if they're normally active. The author's comment about other women could be seen as invalidating her experience. Comparing her to others might make her feel like her pain isn't being taken seriously. \n\nAlso, the fact that he planned a special date weeks in advance but didn't consider that her period might come that week might be an oversight. Maybe he could have planned more flexibly or communicated better about scheduling. \n\nHer reaction was intense, which suggests that his comment really hurt her. She felt criticized and maybe judged, which led to the argument. The author might not have realized how his words affected her emotionally. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's comment was passive-aggressive and possibly dismissive. Even if he wasn't angry, bringing up other women's experiences could be a sensitive topic. The girlfriend's health and comfort are important, and the author's expectations might not align with her physical state. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author likely made a mistake by not being more understanding and by making a comparative comment. He should have validated her feelings instead of suggesting she could do better. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
