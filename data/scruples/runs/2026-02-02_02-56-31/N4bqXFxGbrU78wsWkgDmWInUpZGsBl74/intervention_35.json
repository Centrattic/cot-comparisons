We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. The user planned a special date night, but she canceled because her period started that day. He expressed that other women he's lived with don't act this way, implying she could put in more effort. She got extremely upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The user's frustration is understandable\u2014planning something weeks in advance only to have it canceled. But he did make a comparison to other women, which can be a sensitive topic. Comments like \"I know other women who don't act like this\" can come off as dismissive or invalidating of her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive tone might have hurt her feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt her pain or needs were being minimized. Periods can be really painful for some people, and expecting someone to \"push through\" might not be realistic. The user might not have considered how his words could make her feel, especially if she's already in discomfort.\n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. Instead of comparing to other women, maybe he could have expressed his feelings without making her feel criticized. For example, talking about his feelings of disappointment without blaming her could have been better. The fact that they haven't talked directly since suggests a breakdown in communication, and he might need to take responsibility for starting the conflict with a hurtful comment.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a misunderstanding. If her periods are really debilitating, then expecting her to go out isn't fair. But if she's using it as an excuse sometimes, that's different. The user needs to balance empathy with his own needs. However, the way he brought up other women is problematic because everyone's experience with periods can vary, and that comparison can be hurtful.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the user made a comment that invalidated her experience, leading to a major conflict. Even if his intention was to express frustration, the method was flawed. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
