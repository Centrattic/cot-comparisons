We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. The key points here are communication, understanding, and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the girlfriend doesn't want to go out for the first two days of her period, which is common due to cramps and discomfort. They usually put up with it, which shows some level of acceptance. However, there was a specific instance where they had a scheduled dinner and movie, which she canceled when her period started that day. The user then made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she could put in more effort. This led to a major argument.\n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, it's important to consider empathy and communication. The girlfriend might feel that the user isn't respecting her physical and emotional needs. Periods can be very painful, and expecting her to go out despite that could be seen as dismissive of her experience. The user's comparison to other women might have come off as invalidating her feelings, which could explain her intense reaction. \n\nThe user's frustration is understandable, especially since they had planned the date in advance. However, the way he expressed his feelings, even if not angry, was passive-aggressive and possibly hurtful. It's crucial to approach such situations with understanding rather than comparisons. The girlfriend's response indicates that the comment deeply affected her, leading to a breakdown in communication. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. The user needs to acknowledge that her discomfort is valid and find ways to support her without forcing her to push through pain. At the same time, the girlfriend could communicate her needs more clearly and perhaps suggest alternative plans that accommodate both of their preferences. \n\nSince the user made a hurtful comment that led to a significant argument, he is likely in the wrong. The key issue here is the lack of empathy in his response. Even though his intention was to express his feelings about the canceled plans, the method was inappropriate. The answer would be A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
