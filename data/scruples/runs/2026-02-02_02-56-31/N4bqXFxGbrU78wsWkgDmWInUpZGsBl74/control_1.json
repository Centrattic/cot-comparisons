We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author planned a special date night that she canceled. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she could make more effort. She reacted very strongly, yelling and crying.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend is frustrated with her canceling plans during her period, even when she knew about the plans in advance. He expressed his frustration in a passive-aggressive way, comparing her to other women. She had a strong emotional reaction, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship advice. It's well-known that menstrual cramps can cause significant discomfort, and many women avoid activities during those days. However, every individual is different in how they handle it. The boyfriend is suggesting that she could put in more effort, which might be invalidating her feelings and her body's needs. Comparing her to other women is a common criticism in relationships because it can make someone feel judged or not understood. \n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he's invested in the plans and feels disrespected when they're canceled. But from the girlfriend's side, she's dealing with physical discomfort and might feel pressured to perform or meet expectations despite her condition. The way he phrased his complaint, especially mentioning other women, likely hurt her feelings and made her feel like her experience wasn't valid. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend should have expressed his feelings without invalidating hers. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have discussed his feelings about the disappointment and perhaps found a compromise. His approach came across as dismissive, which led to her emotional outburst. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling attacked or misunderstood. The boyfriend's comment about other women could have triggered her insecurities or made her feel like her pain wasn't acknowledged. \n\nIn terms of fault, the boyfriend's approach was flawed. He didn't validate her feelings and used a comparison that's often seen as unhelpful. He should have approached the situation with empathy, perhaps suggesting alternative plans that were less physically demanding if she was up for it. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict. He's in the wrong because he invalidated her experience and used a comparison that likely hurt her. The correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
