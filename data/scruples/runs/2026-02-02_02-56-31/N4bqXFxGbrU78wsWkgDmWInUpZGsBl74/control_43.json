We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author planned a special date night, but their girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. The author made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act the same way, leading to a huge argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's girlfriend is clearly in pain and discomfort, which can be really tough. It's common for women to experience cramps and other symptoms during their period, and it's understandable that she might not feel up to going out. The author tried to plan something special, which is thoughtful, but he also acknowledged that her periods are random and she cancels plans then.\n\nNow, the key issue is the author's reaction. He told her that other women he's known don't act that way even during their periods. This comment seems to imply that her behavior isn't normal or acceptable, which can be really hurtful. Comparing her to other women in the context of a sensitive health issue is probably not a good approach. It could make her feel like her pain isn't valid or that she's being criticized. The girlfriend's strong reaction (calling him an asshole, crying) suggests that the comment was deeply offensive to her.\n\nThe author might argue that he was just trying to express his disappointment and that he wasn't angry. However, even a passive-aggressive comment can be damaging, especially when it questions the validity of someone's experience. The fact that he made the comparison without fully understanding her situation or considering her feelings is problematic. It's important to validate her experience rather than dismiss it, even if the author is feeling let down.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have communicated her needs better if she knew she might be on her period during the planned date. However, periods can be unpredictable, and it's not always possible to avoid them. The author's planning was in advance, but he should have considered the possibility of her period interfering, given that it's a semi-regular occurrence.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. The author's approach here lacked empathy, as he focused on his own disappointment rather than her well-being. It's important to acknowledge the other person's feelings and find a compromise. Instead of making a comparison, he could have expressed his feelings without invalidating hers, maybe suggesting a rescheduling or an alternative plan.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did make a mistake by making that comparative comment, which was hurtful and dismissive of his girlfriend's legitimate health issues. The answer is A because the author is in the wrong for his insensitive reaction.\n"
