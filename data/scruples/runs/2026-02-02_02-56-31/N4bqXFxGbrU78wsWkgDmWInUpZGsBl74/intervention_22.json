We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. They mention that she's generally great, but during her period, especially the first two days, she cancels plans and wants to stay home. This time, they had a special date night planned, but she called it off when her period started. He expressed that he's seen other women not act this way, and she got really angry, crying and yelling at him.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The girlfriend is experiencing what's likely painful cramps during her period. It's a common issue, and many women do feel more fatigued or uncomfortable during this time. The user had planned a special night, which she knew about in advance, but she still couldn't go through with it. His frustration is understandable, as he made efforts and was let down. However, his comment comparing her to other women he's lived with might have been hurtful.\n\nNow, the key here is whether his reaction was justified. He didn't get angry, just a bit passive-aggressive, but mentioning other women could make her feel judged or inadequate. It's important to recognize that everyone's experiences with their periods are different. What works for one person might not work for another. By bringing up other women, he might have invalidated her feelings and pain, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nAlso, communication is crucial in relationships. Instead of making a passive-aggressive remark, maybe he should have expressed his disappointment in a more understanding way. Acknowledging her pain while also expressing his feelings could have led to a better resolution. However, she also could have communicated her needs more clearly before the plans, even if she knew about them in advance. But since she did cancel, maybe she was honest about her condition.\n\nThe user is now stuck because they don't know what to say next. The main question is about whether he did something wrong. From a relationship advice perspective, comparing partners to others is often a bad idea because it can make people feel unappreciated. His comment might have triggered her defensive reaction because she felt disrespected. So, even if his intention was to express his feelings, the way he did it was harmful.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because his approach was not empathetic and led to a significant argument. He should have found a way to express his feelings without invalidating her experience, which is a common issue in such situations.\n"
