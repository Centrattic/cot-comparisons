We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He mentions that she's usually great, but during her period for the first two days, she just stays home and cancels everything. He tried to schedule around it but it's unpredictable. Then there was this one date night he planned weeks in advance, and she canceled again. He told her, not angrily but maybe passive-aggressively, that other women he's known don't act like this and she should try harder. She got extremely upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. He's confused now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Periods can be really painful for some people. Cramps, fatigue, mood swings are common. It's not just about \"acting\" a certain way. If she's experiencing her period, especially the first two days, it's possible that physical discomfort is making it hard for her to be active. So, his expectation that she should put in more effort despite that could be unreasonable. \n\nHe also said he knows other women who don't act this way. Comparing her to others is a classic mistake in relationships. Even if those other women managed to go out, every person's experience with their period is different. What works for them might not work for her. Bringing up comparisons can come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences.\n\nPassive-aggressive communication isn't great. Even if he wasn't angry, the way he expressed his frustration might have been hurtful. Instead of pointing out others, maybe a better approach would have been to express his own feelings without blaming her. Like, \"I feel disappointed when plans are canceled, but I understand it's your period week. Let's find something we can do together that's comfortable for you.\"\n\nAlso, he mentions she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked directly since. That's a red flag for unresolved conflict. He needs to address it, but the question is whether he was wrong. His comment about other women and suggesting she should try harder for him is likely the main issue here. It's important to validate her experience rather than question it. \n\nSo, putting it all together: He's expecting her to push through physical discomfort, which she might be experiencing. Using passive-aggressive remarks to compare her to others is invalidating. She's clearly hurt and upset, which points to his approach being wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (he's in the wrong). He should apologize and show understanding, maybe discuss ways to support each other during her period.\n"
