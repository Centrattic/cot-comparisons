We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend doesn't want to go out during her period, which he knows about. He plans a special date night weeks in advance, but she cancels because her period started that day. He tells her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she could make an effort. This leads to her having a strong emotional reaction, calling him names and locking herself in her room.\n\nSo, the key points here are about expectations in a relationship and communication. The author planned something important, but the girlfriend was physically unwell. The author's comment about other women seems to minimize her experience. Even if he's not angry, pointing out others might make her feel criticized. \n\nPMS and menstrual cramps can be severe enough to affect daily activities. The author might not fully understand how bad it is for her. By suggesting she should \"put in more effort,\" he's not acknowledging her pain. Also, the fact that her period comes at random times adds to the unpredictability, making it harder for him to adjust plans, but he should consider her health first.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, which shows how hurtful his words were. Comparing her to others is a common trigger for defensiveness. The author expected her to prioritize his plans over her discomfort, which might be unreasonable. He should have communicated his feelings without belittling her situation.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. Even if the author is frustrated, it's not fair to dismiss her needs. He needs to apologize and understand that her response is valid. So, he's in the wrong here.\n"
