We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after getting upset with their girlfriend because she canceled their plans when she was on her period. They had a special dinner and movie night planned, which she bailed on due to her period. He told her that other women he's known don't act like that even when on their period, implying she should make more effort. She then reacted extremely negatively, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's behavior is to stay home and rest during her period, which he's usually okay with. But this time, he had plans and felt let down. He expressed his feelings in a passive-aggressive way, comparing her to other women. The key issue is whether his response was justified.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, comparing one's partner to others is generally a bad idea. It can come off as dismissive and disrespectful. Even if he wasn't angry, saying that other women don't act like this might have invalidated her feelings. Menstrual cramps can be severe and unpredictable, and she might have been in genuine pain. His comment might have made her feel like her needs were being overlooked or minimized.\n\nShe reacted strongly, which suggests that his words hurt her. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since indicates the severity of her hurt feelings. He might not have realized that his statement was a direct attack on her, making her feel judged and unappreciated. \n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is key. Instead of comparing her to others, he should have expressed his feelings without invalidating hers. Maybe he could have asked for a compromise or checked in with her about how she was feeling. However, his approach was flawed because it focused on her shortcomings rather than seeking a mutual solution.\n\nOn the other hand, she has a right to need rest during her period, and he might have been feeling neglected or frustrated. But the way he chose to address it was inappropriate. He needs to take responsibility for his part in the argument. Apologizing and understanding her perspective is necessary here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong because his response was disrespectful and dismissive. Comparing her to others and implying she wasn't trying hard enough was hurtful and contributed to the conflict.\n"
