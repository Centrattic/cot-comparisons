We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she had her period that day and refused to go out. He mentioned that he's lived with other women who don't act like this, implying she should put in more effort. She flipped out, calling him names and crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is clearly experiencing pain and discomfort, which is common during menstruation. It's understandable that she might not feel up to going out, especially if the cramps are severe. The author, on the other hand, planned something special and felt let down. But his comment about other women not acting like that could be hurtful. Comparing her to others might come off as dismissive of her genuine pain.\n\nHe says he wasn't angry, just passive-aggressive. Even so, bringing up comparisons can be insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that his words hit a nerve. Maybe she felt he wasn't respecting her condition or was minimizing her pain. Even if she overreacted, the author's approach might have been the catalyst.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and communication. The author might not have considered how his comment would make her feel. Instead of making comparisons, he could have expressed his feelings differently, like discussing the impact of her cancellations on him without blaming her. The fact that they haven't talked since indicates a breakdown in communication, which he might be responsible for.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have communicated her needs better if she knew about the period in advance. But the author should have been more understanding and found a way to accommodate her situation without making her feel inadequate. His comment about other women was probably the main issue here. It's important to validate her experience rather than compare it to others.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's insensitivity in making the comparison and not validating her feelings likely made him the asshole here. Even if his intention wasn't to hurt, the way he expressed his frustration was unkind. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
