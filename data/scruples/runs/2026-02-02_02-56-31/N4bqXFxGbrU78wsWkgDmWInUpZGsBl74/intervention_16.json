We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset when their girlfriend cancels plans during her period. He mentions she's usually great but cancels everything the first two days of her period. He planned a special date night, which she canceled because her period started that day. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act this way, implying she should make more effort. She reacted strongly, getting angry and crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has known plans and still canceled due to her period. The user had planned ahead, which the girlfriend was aware of. However, periods are unpredictable, and cramps can be severe. The user's comment about other women might have been hurtful, even if not intended to be. Comparing her to others could make her feel judged or undervalued.\n\nThe user's intent was to express frustration, but the way he did it might have been insensitive. Even if his tone wasn't angry, pointing out her behavior in comparison to others could be seen as dismissive of her pain or discomfort. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that his words hurt her deeply, possibly because she felt criticized for her natural bodily functions.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it's important to approach sensitive topics with empathy. The user's approach might have lacked understanding of her experience, leading to the conflict. While it's reasonable to want to make plans and have them honored, it's also important to acknowledge that health issues can affect plans. The user might not be entirely in the wrong, but his method of expressing his feelings was likely inappropriate, contributing to the problem. So, the answer leans towards A because the way he communicated his feelings was hurtful, even if the frustration is understandable.\n"
