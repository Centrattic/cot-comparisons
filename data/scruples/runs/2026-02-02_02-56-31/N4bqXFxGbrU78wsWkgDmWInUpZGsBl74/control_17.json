We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy getting upset because his girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. He planned a special date, but she canceled because she was on her period. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, suggesting she could put in more effort. She got really upset, yelled at him, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend cancels plans during her period, and he got frustrated enough to make a passive-aggressive comment. The key points are: 1) He planned this date weeks in advance, and she knew about it. 2) He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she should make more effort. 3) She reacted strongly emotionally, which he didn't expect.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. The author's approach here was to express his feelings in a way that might come off as dismissive of her physical discomfort. Even if he didn't mean to be angry, his comment about other women not acting that way during periods could be seen as invalidating her experience. Periods can be really painful for some people, and expecting someone to go out despite that might be unreasonable. \n\nHe also mentioned that her period comes at a \"semi-random time every month,\" so maybe he can't always plan around it. But in this case, the date was planned weeks ahead, and she knew. However, maybe her period started right then, which is unpredictable. The problem is that he didn't consider her health and well-being, and instead criticized her, which led to her emotional outburst.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling unappreciated or criticized for something she can't control. She might be in pain and feeling that her needs aren't being considered. The author's comment about other women could make her feel like she's being compared unfavorably, which is hurtful.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was in how he communicated his feelings. Instead of understanding her situation and maybe adjusting plans, he made a passive-aggressive remark that invalidated her experience. Even if he's frustrated, it's important to support a partner during times when they're unwell. The fact that she was on her period, which is a natural and uncontrollable part of her body, should be taken into account. His reaction was not supportive and likely hurtful, hence why she reacted so strongly.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't show empathy and instead criticized her for something beyond her control, leading to a hurtful response.\n"
