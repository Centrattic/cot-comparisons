We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. So, the situation is that the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and he got frustrated and made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with. She reacted extremely negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user says his girlfriend is great, but the issue is her behavior during her period. He had a special date night planned, and she canceled because her period started. He expressed his frustration by saying other women don't act like that, which upset her a lot.\n\nFrom a general perspective, it's important to recognize that period-related discomfort can be very real and varies from person to person. Some people might feel more cramps or other symptoms that affect their ability to go out. However, the user had planned this in advance and she knew about it. But he also mentions that her period comes at a semi-random time, so maybe she can't always plan around it.\n\nThe key point here is the way he communicated his frustration. Instead of expressing his feelings without comparing her to others, he made a comparison that implied she wasn't making an effort. Using passive-aggressive comments about other women could come off as invalidating her experience. It's possible that his remark hurt her feelings because it suggested that her reaction was excessive or not typical, which could make her feel judged or not supported.\n\nHe asked if he's in the wrong. Well, in relationships, communication is crucial. Even if he was frustrated, the way he addressed it might have been hurtful. The girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that his comment was a significant breach in their communication. It's possible that she felt criticized for her legitimate health condition. So, while he might have been upset about the canceled plans, his approach was likely the main issue.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether his frustration was justified but the delivery was poor. Since the girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but her symptoms might be valid, it's a balancing act. However, making comparisons to other women in a passive-aggressive way is generally not a good approach. So, he might be in the wrong for how he communicated his feelings instead of addressing it more empathetically.\n"
