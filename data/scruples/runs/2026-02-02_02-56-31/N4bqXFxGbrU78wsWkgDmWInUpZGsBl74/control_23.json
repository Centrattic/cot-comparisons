We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period, canceling plans. The author mentions that he usually puts up with it, but once he got upset when she canceled a special date night, even though she had known about it weeks in advance. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act like that, even during their periods. This led to her blowing up at him.\n\nSo, the key points here are about empathy and communication. The author's girlfriend is experiencing physical discomfort and has valid reasons for staying in. The author's reaction, even if not angry, was passive-aggressive and made a comparison implying she's not trying hard enough. That's dismissive of her experience and could be seen as minimizing her pain. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's understandable given the comment he made. He's putting her in a position where she's being criticized for something that's a natural bodily function and can be quite painful. The fact that he mentioned other women sets a standard that's not fair, as everyone's experience with periods varies. \n\nThe author's approach was to express his disappointment by comparing her to others, which is a criticism rather than a supportive conversation. The girlfriend's health and well-being should be prioritized, and the author should have approached the situation with more understanding and flexibility. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his response was insensitive and failed to consider her physical state and the nature of her discomfort. He should have communicated his feelings without making her feel criticized, perhaps by expressing his disappointment in a way that acknowledges her situation.\n"
