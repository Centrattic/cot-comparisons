We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He set up a special date night, but she canceled because her period started, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act that way. She got really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as usually laid back and great, but she cancels plans when she's on her period. The user had planned a special night in advance, and she knew about it. When she canceled, he said something passive-aggressive about other women not being like that. She reacted strongly, which is out of character for her.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. Even if the user's intention wasn't to be harsh, comparing his current girlfriend to previous partners is likely to be hurtful. Women's experiences with their periods vary, and what might be manageable for some could be more severe for others. Cramps can be debilitating, and the user might not fully understand the extent of her discomfort. By suggesting she should \"put forward a little more effort,\" he's dismissing her feelings and physical state, which can be seen as invalidating. That could explain her strong reaction.\n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. It's important to consider that everyone's pain and needs are valid, even if they seem minor to others. The user's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it was inappropriate. He should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding instead of making a comparison that undermines her experience.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because his comment was hurtful and lacked empathy, even if he wasn't angry. He should have handled the situation with more sensitivity.\n"
