We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend doesn't want to go out during her period, especially the first two days. The author usually puts up with it but got upset when she canceled a special date night they had planned in advance. He mentioned that other women he's lived with didn't act this way, implying she should put in more effort for him. This led to a big argument where the girlfriend was extremely upset and cried.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's main issue is frustration with his girlfriend's behavior during her period. He planned something special, and she canceled. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's known. The girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014angry and emotional. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author's statement about other women could be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings and the physical discomfort she's experiencing. Even if not said angrily, it might have come off as critical. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this comment hit a nerve, possibly making her feel invalidated or unappreciated.\n\nPMS and period symptoms can vary, and some women experience severe cramps or other issues that make it hard to leave the house. The author's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it may have been hurtful. The key point here is empathy. The author might not fully grasp how his words affected her, and the comparison to other women could have made her feel like her needs aren't valid.\n\nAlso, the fact that they had planned this in advance and she still decided to cancel could indicate that she's made a conscious choice, but maybe there were underlying reasons she didn't communicate. However, the author's response was to compare her to others, which isn't helpful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have considered how his words might impact her. Even if his intention was to express his feelings, the way he did it caused significant distress. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a sign of how much the comment hurt her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was likely hurtful and dismissive. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
