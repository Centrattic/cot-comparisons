We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation involves a planned date night that got canceled because she was on her period, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who didn't act like that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is clearly in pain during her period, which is a valid and common experience for many women. The fact that she's been on her period at random times and it's disrupted plans before might be frustrating, but he's been putting up with it so far. Then there's this specific instance where he had a big date planned, and she canceled. He expressed his frustration, even if not angrily, by comparing her to other women. That seems to have triggered a strong negative reaction from her.\n\nThe key points here are communication, empathy, and understanding. Even if his intention was to express his feelings, bringing up other women in a comparison could come off as dismissive of her feelings and pain. It might make her feel like her experience isn't valid or that she's being judged. The fact that she was on her period and in pain is a real factor here, and he might not have considered how that affects her ability to participate in plans, regardless of how much effort she puts in.\n\nAlso, the way he communicated his frustration\u2014passive-aggressively\u2014could have been a trigger. Even if he didn't mean to be harsh, the approach might have been insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that his comment hit a nerve. She might feel that he's not respecting her needs and that he's placing the burden of effort solely on her, which isn't fair.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. Even if someone else has handled their period differently, that doesn't mean another person is in the wrong for handling it differently. Everyone's experience with pain and discomfort is different. The user might have failed to acknowledge her specific situation and instead made a comparison that invalidated her feelings. That's a common source of conflict in relationships.\n\nMoreover, planning a date weeks in advance and expecting her to go through the first two days of her period could be unrealistic if he's aware of her cycle's unpredictability. He might need to adjust his planning to accommodate her needs, rather than expecting her to push through discomfort. It's a mutual responsibility in a relationship to accommodate each other's needs, not just one person's.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user did make a mistake by making a comparison to other women and not fully validating his girlfriend's feelings. He might have approached the situation without enough empathy, leading to her strong reaction. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here.\n"
