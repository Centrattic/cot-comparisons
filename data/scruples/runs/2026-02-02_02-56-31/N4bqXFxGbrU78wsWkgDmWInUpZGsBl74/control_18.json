We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she canceled their plans when she was on her period. He planned a special date night in advance, but she ended up staying home due to her period. He told her that other women he's lived with don't act like this, implying she should make more effort. She was very upset and yelled at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as usually being laid-back and kind, but during her period, she cancels plans and stays home. The author had already planned this date weeks in advance, so he had the knowledge and could have adjusted. However, he made a comment about other women not acting this way, which seems like a comparison that could be hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. Even if the author was frustrated, making a passive-aggressive comment comparing his current girlfriend to others could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and physical state. Menstruation can be physically uncomfortable, and everyone's experience is different. The fact that she canceled a planned date because of her period isn't necessarily a choice; it's a medical reality for her. The author's reaction seems to not take that into account, which might be why she got so upset.\n\nAlso, the way he communicated his frustration\u2014comparing her to others\u2014could come off as invalidating her experience. It's possible that she felt judged or criticized for her natural bodily functions and the need for rest. The author might not realize that his comparison could be hurtful, even if he wasn't angry at the time. His comment about other women not acting this way might make her feel like her needs are unreasonable or that she's being lazy when she's actually dealing with physical discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that he was trying to communicate his needs and had a right to be upset because he put effort into planning. However, in a relationship, both partners need to balance their needs. The author's approach here was not constructive. Instead of expressing his own feelings without comparing her to others, a better approach would be to talk about his feelings and find a compromise next time, rather than making her feel like she's doing something wrong.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's comment was likely inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, he might be at fault here. The answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
