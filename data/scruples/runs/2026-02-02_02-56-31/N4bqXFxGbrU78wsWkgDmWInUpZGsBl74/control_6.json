We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she didn't want to go out during her period. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been living together for three months, and the girlfriend often cancels plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. The author mentions she's usually great but this is a recurring issue. The specific incident was a planned date night with dinner and movies, which she canceled when her period started. The author made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's known, suggesting she could put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted extremely negatively, calling him an asshole and crying, and they haven't talked since. The author is confused and upset, wondering if he's at fault.\n\nNow, considering the context of period-related discomfort. It's well-known that many women experience cramps, fatigue, or other symptoms during their period, which can affect their ability to engage in activities. The author seems to acknowledge this to some extent, saying \"I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever.\" But he's frustrated because her periods come at unpredictable times and she cancels plans. This might be a valid concern for scheduling, but the way he expressed it might be the problem.\n\nThe key here is the author's communication. He says he told her \"not angrily\" but \"passively-aggressively.\" Passive-aggression often involves indirect expressions of hostility, which can be hurtful even if not shouted. Then he compared her to other women he's lived with, implying that she's different and that her behavior is excessive. That comparison can come off as dismissive and invalidating, making her feel like her pain isn't real or important. \n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction makes sense if she felt her health and well-being were being undermined. When someone is in pain, being told that others cope better might make them feel guilty or unappreciated. The author might not have intended to be cruel, but his words could have been perceived as blaming or minimizing her experience. \n\nAlso, the fact that they've only been living together for three months suggests that the author might be expecting a level of consistency that's not realistic. Periods can be irregular, and it's possible she's managing her health as best as she can. The author's frustration might stem from a lack of understanding or communication about her specific needs and the unpredictability of her cycle.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's needs and communicate effectively. The author's comment, even if not meant to be harsh, crossed a line by comparing her to others and suggesting she should do more. That's likely where he went wrong. The girlfriend's emotional response indicates that she felt hurt and disrespected, so the author should take responsibility for his words and approach the situation with empathy and a willingness to listen.\n"
