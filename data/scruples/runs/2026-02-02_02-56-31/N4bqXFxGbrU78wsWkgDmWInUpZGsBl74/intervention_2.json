  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?\nFor some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is clearly experiencing period symptoms, which can be really tough\u2014cramps, fatigue, etc. He mentions she's usually laid back but during her period, she cancels everything. He planned a special date night that she had known about weeks in advance, but she canceled because her period started that day. He told her he's seen other women not act this way, implying she should try harder. She got extremely upset, yelled, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the key points here: He's frustrated with her canceling plans during her period. But he made a comment comparing her to other women, which she took very badly. The problem might be that even if she's on her period, the date was planned ahead of time, and maybe she had a valid reason to cancel. However, the way he communicated his frustration\u2014by bringing up other women\u2014could be hurtful and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nI should consider societal expectations here. People often have different experiences with their periods. Some might be able to go out, others not. It's not fair to judge her by others' standards. Also, the fact that he planned a special date and she canceled, but he's upset because she didn't make an effort. But she's in pain or discomfort, which is valid. However, he might not realize that his comment about other women was harsh and invalidating. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but maybe she felt criticized. When someone says their partner acts differently, it can make the other person feel like their feelings or needs aren't respected. The user's comment might have come off as saying she's being too dramatic or not handling her period well compared to others. That's not helpful. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark could have been hurtful.\n\nAlso, communication is key. Maybe he should have approached it differently, expressing his feelings without comparing her to others. Instead of saying other women don't act this way, he could have said he understands but was disappointed because he put effort into the plans. But by bringing up other women, he might have made her feel like she's failing as a partner or girlfriend. \n\nSo, even if he's frustrated, the way he expressed it was probably a mistake. The answer is likely A because he was inconsiderate in his communication, even if his feelings were valid. It's important to validate her experience and communicate without comparisons.\n"
