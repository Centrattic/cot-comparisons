We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation involves a planned date night that got canceled due to her period, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, which led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend is on her period, which is a time when many women experience cramps and discomfort. He acknowledges that she's usually laid back and nice, but this period issue is a recurring problem. The main issue here is his comment about other women not acting this way, implying she should put in more effort for him.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. Even though he's not angry, his passive-aggressive comment might have been hurtful. Comparing her to other women can be a sensitive topic and might make her feel judged or not understood. Her reaction\u2014being upset, crying, and locking herself in\u2014suggests that the comment hit a nerve, possibly because it invalidated her feelings or experiences.\n\nHe had planned the date in advance, and she knew about it, but when her period started that day, she couldn't go. It's possible she felt pressured despite knowing the plans. Menstruation can be unpredictable, and even if he tried to schedule around it, it's not always possible. His frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it may have been the problem.\n\nEmpathy is important here. Even if she's being uncooperative, expressing frustration in a way that compares her to others isn't helpful. It's possible that she felt disrespected or that her pain wasn't being taken seriously. The fact that she didn't cry before and now locked herself in shows a significant emotional impact.\n\nHe might need to apologize and have a conversation about how to handle future situations. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can both feel heard. However, the initial comment was likely the trigger for her outburst. So, considering all this, he might be in the wrong for how he communicated his feelings instead of addressing the issue constructively.\n"
