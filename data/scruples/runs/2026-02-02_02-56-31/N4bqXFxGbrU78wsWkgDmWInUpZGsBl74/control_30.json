We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her period. The key points here are the context of their relationship, the specific incident, and the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she doesn't want to do anything when she's on her period for the first two days, cancels plans, and it's causing issues. The author mentions that he usually puts up with it, but this specific time he made a special plan that she canceled. He said he wasn't angry but a bit passive-aggressive, comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act this way.\n\nThe problem here seems to be the author's approach. Even though he might be frustrated, bringing up past experiences with other women in a passive-aggressive way is likely to hurt her feelings. Comparing her to others is a common relationship no-no because it undermines her feelings and makes her feel inadequate. The girlfriend's strong reaction (crying, anger) suggests that his comment was a significant breach of trust or respect.\n\nAlso, the author planned the date weeks in advance, and she knew about it. However, periods can be unpredictable, and she might genuinely be in pain. The author's frustration is understandable, but his method of expressing it was inappropriate. Instead of making a passive-aggressive remark, he should have communicated his feelings more constructively or adjusted the plans together.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. Even if one doesn't fully understand the other's perspective, expressing it in a way that's respectful is crucial. The author's comment about other women implies that his girlfriend's behavior is excessive, which isn't supportive. So, yes, he's in the wrong here because of the way he handled the situation, not necessarily the frustration itself but how he communicated it.\n"
