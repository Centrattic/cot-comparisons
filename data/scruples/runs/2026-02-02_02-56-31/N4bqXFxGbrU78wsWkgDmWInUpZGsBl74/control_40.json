We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The girlfriend has periods that make her stay home, which the author had to adjust to. But when he planned a special date night, she canceled, and he expressed frustration by comparing her to other women he's known. That led to her emotional outburst.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author mentions that he's usually understanding, even though her period schedule is unpredictable. However, in this specific instance, he made a passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting that way. That could be seen as invalidating her feelings and needs. Even if he wasn't angry, the remark likely hurt her because it implied she wasn't trying hard enough, which is dismissive of her pain.\n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't consider her perspective enough. He might not realize how severe her cramps are or that she's making a conscious effort to push through, but maybe she's at her limit. The fact that she was crying and upset shows the impact of his words. Comparing her to others can come off as judgmental and not supportive.\n\nAlso, the author planned something special that she couldn't do, which might have made her feel guilty or like she was letting him down. His comment could have triggered her frustration and made her feel criticized. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. The author's approach here might have lacked that validation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was probably hurtful and not supportive. Even though he had a valid frustration about the plans, the way he expressed it was problematic. The answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
