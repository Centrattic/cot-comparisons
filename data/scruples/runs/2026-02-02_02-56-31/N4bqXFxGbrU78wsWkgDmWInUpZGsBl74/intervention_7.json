We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. They mention that she's usually laid back but during her period, she refuses to do anything, even if they had plans. In this specific instance, they had a special date night planned that she canceled because her period started that day. He told her that other women he's lived with don't act like that, implying she could put in more effort. She had a strong emotional reaction, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The user acknowledges that she's great, but there's this recurring issue. He's frustrated because the plans are canceled at the last minute, and he feels his efforts are being dismissed. On the other hand, she's dealing with physical discomfort and chose to prioritize her health and comfort. \n\nThe key point here is the communication and the way he expressed his feelings. He said he wasn't angry, maybe a bit passive-aggressive. Comparing her to other women he's known might come off as dismissive of her legitimate pain. Even if his intention was to express frustration, the way he did it could make her feel invalidated. It's possible that she felt he wasn't considering her well-being and was instead focused on his own plans.\n\nThe fact that she reacted so strongly suggests that this is a sensitive issue for her. Chronic pain or severe menstrual symptoms can be debilitating, and she might feel that her needs are being overlooked. His comment about others might have triggered feelings of inadequacy or that her experience isn't valid. \n\nHe might not be in the complete wrong because it's natural to feel let down when plans fall through, especially if they're special. However, the way he handled the situation could be seen as insensitive. The problem isn't just the comparison but the lack of empathy shown in the moment. He didn't validate her feelings or offer support but instead criticized her. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners need to make effort and understanding. He could have expressed his disappointment without making her feel like she was wrong to prioritize her health. Apologizing and discussing how they can both meet in the middle (like choosing activities that are easier to adjust if she's unwell) might have been a better approach. \n\nSo, considering all this, while his frustration is understandable, his method of addressing it was likely hurtful and dismissive, which makes him at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer would be A for yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
