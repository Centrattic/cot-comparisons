We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy is upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and he got frustrated after a specific incident where they had a planned date. He mentioned other women he's lived with didn't act this way, and that led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's perspective. Menstruation can be really painful for some people. Cramps, fatigue, and other symptoms can make it hard to do anything, especially if it's the first two days. The guy acknowledges that girls get cramps and stuff, so he understands that. However, he's frustrated because she cancels plans even when they're scheduled in advance, and this particular time he had a special date planned that she canceled.\n\nNow, the key point here is his comment. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying that she could do better. That's probably where the conflict escalated. Even though he says he wasn't angry and maybe a bit passive-aggressive, it's possible he unintentionally invalidated her feelings and her experience. Comparing her to other women can come off as dismissive or critical, which can be really hurtful. It's like saying her pain isn't as valid as others'.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's reaction, she was clearly upset and felt attacked. She responded with anger and crying, which suggests that his words hurt her deeply. It's possible she felt he wasn't being supportive and was instead expecting her to push through her discomfort, which isn't fair. Everyone's body is different, and what one person can handle, another might not. By bringing up other women, he might have made her feel like she's failing in the relationship.\n\nThe guy had planned the date knowing her period was coming, but he expected her to go through with it anyway. That might be unreasonable. Even if she had mentioned her period before, relying on her to be predictable isn't fair if her cycle is irregular. She might not know herself when it's coming, so expecting her to plan around it might be too much.\n\nSo, in terms of accountability, the guy's comment about other women was probably the main issue. Comparing partners can be damaging, and it's important to validate each other's experiences without judgment. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling misunderstood and unappreciated. The guy needs to acknowledge her feelings and maybe find a way to be more supportive, like offering to help her feel better at home or adjusting plans in the future.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he invalidated her experience by comparing her to others, which likely caused the argument. The key takeaway is that everyone's pain and needs are different, and such comparisons can be harmful.\n"
