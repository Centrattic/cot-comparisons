We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend is unwell during her period for the first two days and cancels plans. The author is frustrated because he planned a special date night that she canceled. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, suggesting she could put in more effort. This led to a major argument where the girlfriend was upset and now they haven't talked directly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's frustration with his girlfriend's period-related cancellations, his comment about other women, and the resulting conflict. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI think the main issue here is the author's approach. While it's understandable to feel disappointed when plans are canceled, especially if they were special, the way he communicated his frustration was problematic. Comparing his girlfriend to other women is a classic relationship no-no. It invalidates her feelings and can be hurtful. Even if he meant it as a passive-aggressive comment, it came across as dismissive of her health and pain.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling criticized and not supported during a time when she's already struggling. The author's comment could have made her feel unappreciated or judged, which is why she lashed out. The fact that they've been living together for only three months might mean that communication issues are still being worked out, but the author's approach definitely contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's comment was disrespectful and could be seen as blaming her for her biological condition. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark was still a way of expressing frustration that's not constructive. The girlfriend's needs for support during her period should be a priority, and the author's reaction shows a lack of empathy in this situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective. The answer would be A.\n"
