We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and after a specific instance where he expressed his frustration, she got really angry. He wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as usually laid-back and great, but she has this issue with her period. He's been putting up with it until this one time. The key point here is that he compared her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not handling her period as well as others. That comparison is probably where the problem lies. People often take comparisons to others poorly, especially in relationships. \n\nHe mentioned she had known about the plans weeks in advance and still canceled. But maybe there's more to her situation. Maybe her period symptoms are worse than he realizes, or maybe she's been dealing with other stress. He might not fully understand the severity of her discomfort. \n\nThe way he expressed his frustration, even if passively-aggressively, could have been hurtful. Telling someone they don't measure up to others can feel like a personal attack. Her reaction was intense, which might indicate that his words hit a nerve or triggered deeper feelings of insecurity or frustration on her part. \n\nHe might not realize that his comment invalidated her feelings. Instead of supporting her during a tough time, he implied she was being unreasonable. That could have made her feel unappreciated and misunderstood. \n\nOn the other hand, he was planning a special date and felt his effort was disregarded. It's reasonable to feel let down when plans don't go as expected. But the way he addressed the issue was probably the main problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's comment about other women was likely the root of the conflict. He's in the wrong for making that comparison and not validating her experience. The answer is A.\n"
