We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, she's usually laid back, but when her period starts, she cancels all plans and stays home. He's tried to be understanding but this time, after planning a special date, she canceled again. He mentioned that other women he's lived with didn't act this way, which led to a big argument and her being really upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and empathy. While it's true that periods can cause cramps and discomfort, leading someone to want to rest, the user's response might have been dismissive. He compared her to other women, which can come off as invalidating her experience. Everyone's different, and pain thresholds vary. Plus, she knew about the plans weeks in advance but still canceled. But the way he expressed his frustration\u2014passive-aggressively\u2014might not have been the best approach.\n\nHe should have considered her feelings. Saying other women don't act like this implies she's overreacting. Even if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive comment can be hurtful. It's important to validate her pain and maybe suggest alternatives, like modifying the plans instead of expecting her to go out. However, she also could have communicated better if she knew in advance. \n\nOn the other hand, he had put effort into planning, which is valid. But his response was confrontational. The argument escalated because he didn't express understanding first. So, while there's some fault on both sides, the main issue is his communication style and lack of empathy. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong here.\n"
