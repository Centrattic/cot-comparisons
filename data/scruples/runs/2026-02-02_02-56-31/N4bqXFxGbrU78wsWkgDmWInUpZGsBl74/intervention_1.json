We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did something wrong by getting upset with their girlfriend because she didn't want to go out on their date night when she was on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend is on her period for the first two days and cancels plans. The user had planned a special date night weeks in advance, but she decided to stay home. He expressed his frustration, mentioning that other women he's known don't act this way, and that's when she got really upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the user's comment about other women. Even if he wasn't angry, comparing his current partner to others can be hurtful. It implies that she's not meeting his expectations based on his past experiences, which isn't fair. Every person's experience with their period is different. Some might be more affected than others. Cramps and mood changes can vary a lot.\n\nHe also planned the date knowing about her cycle, but maybe didn't realize how bad she was feeling that specific time. However, she did know about the plans in advance. The user's frustration is understandable, but the way he communicated it was passive-aggressive and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names and crying. That shows how hurtful his words were. Even if the user's intention wasn't to attack her, the comparison to other women likely made her feel unappreciated and judged. Communication is key in relationships, and instead of expressing his disappointment respectfully, he made a comparison that could be seen as belittling her experience.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's needs. The user might need to consider that his girlfriend's needs are valid, even if they differ from others. Also, he should have discussed his feelings without comparing her to others. Apologizing and understanding her perspective would be important steps here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user did say something that was disrespectful and hurtful, even if he wasn't angry. Therefore, he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
