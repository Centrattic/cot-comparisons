We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is on her period and feels too unwell to go out, even canceling plans she knew about weeks in advance. The author planned a special date night but she canceled because she started her period that day. He told her that other women he's known don't act that way, which led to her getting really upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are about empathy and communication. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might have been hurtful. He compared his current partner to other women he's known, which could come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. Even if he wasn't angry, saying other women don't act this way can make someone feel like their pain isn't valid. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt criticized or not supported. Periods can be really tough, and having a partner not understand or respect that can lead to emotional distress. The author's comment might have made her feel like her needs weren't important or that he didn't take her pain seriously. \n\nAlso, the author might not have considered that even though he knows about her periods in general, they can be unpredictable. She might have started her period that day despite her best efforts. So, the cancellation wasn't something she could control. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's frustration led him to make a comparison that hurt his girlfriend. He should have tried to understand her situation rather than imply she's not trying hard enough. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his response was dismissive and hurtful, even if he wasn't angry. He should have communicated more compassionately and supported her during a difficult time instead of making a comparison that undermined her feelings.\n"
