We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. So, the situation is that the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author is frustrated with. He planned a special date, but she changed her mind because she was on her period, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with. She then had a huge emotional reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Periods can cause physical discomfort, cramps, fatigue, etc., which are real and valid reasons for someone to want to rest. The author acknowledges that women get cramps during their period, but he's frustrated because she cancels plans. He mentions that he's lived with other women who didn't act that way, implying that he expects her to put in more effort even when she's not feeling well.\n\nThe key points here are communication, empathy, and expectations. The author planned the date with advance notice, and she knew about it. However, when her period started, she felt too unwell to go. The author's response was to make a passive-aggressive comment about other women, which upset her. Her reaction was intense, including yelling and crying, suggesting that his comment was hurtful. \n\nFrom a relational perspective, it's important to validate a partner's feelings and physical state. Even if the author is feeling let down or frustrated, criticizing her for not meeting his expectations when she's unwell can be seen as dismissive of her pain. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since indicates a significant breakdown in communication. \n\nThe author's statement that \"none of them act like this ever\" might come off as invalidating her experience. Every person's experience with menstruation can vary, and comparing her to others could make her feel misunderstood or judged. It's possible that she felt criticized for her natural bodily functions and the discomfort she's experiencing, which can be a sensitive topic.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, especially if he had invested time and effort into planning the date. However, the way he expressed his feelings was hurtful. Instead of expressing his disappointment in a constructive way, he made a comparison that could be seen as belittling her situation. \n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should support each other through physical and emotional challenges. The author's comment might have made her feel like her needs and feelings were less important than his plans. It's crucial for him to acknowledge her perspective and find a middle ground. Perhaps discussing alternative plans or checking in with her on how she's feeling when her period starts could help both sides feel heard and respected.\n\nThe girlfriend's intense reaction suggests that the author's words hit a nerve. She might have felt that he wasn't respecting her needs or that he was being unfair. The fact that he waited until she got home and then made the comment, even if not angry, could have been perceived as passive-aggressive, which often leads to misunderstandings and hurt feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel justified in his frustration, his approach was flawed. He should have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others or dismissing her experience. The responsibility here is on the author to validate her situation and find a way to express his feelings without causing harm. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
