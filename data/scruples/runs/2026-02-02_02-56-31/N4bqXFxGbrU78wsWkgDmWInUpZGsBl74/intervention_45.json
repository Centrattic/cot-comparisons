  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?\nFor some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He mentions that it's only the first couple of days and that he's usually understanding, but this one time he got impatient and made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who didn't act that way. The girlfriend had a strong negative reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user's girlfriend is dealing with her period, which is a common experience that can cause physical discomfort. He acknowledges that women can have cramps and other issues during their period, so he's aware. However, he's frustrated because she cancels plans, and in this specific instance, he expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women, which led to a major conflict.\n\nFrom a general perspective, while it's understandable that he's disappointed about canceled plans, especially when he put a lot of effort into planning, his response might have been hurtful. Comparing his girlfriend to other women in a way that implies she's not doing enough could be seen as dismissive of her experience. Menstrual pain can vary from person to person, and what might seem like a minor inconvenience to one person can be debilitating for another. Even if she's \"just\" staying home, the user's comment might have invalidated her feelings and made her feel unappreciated.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that the comment hit a nerve. She might have felt criticized for her natural response to her body's condition. The user's statement that \"none of them act like this\" could have made her feel like her pain isn't valid or that she's being selfish. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive tone might have been hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is trying to communicate his feelings of being let down and perhaps feeling that his efforts aren't respected. However, the way he expressed it was likely the issue. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have discussed his feelings without blaming her, perhaps suggesting alternative ways to handle the situation together.\n\nThe key factors here are empathy and communication. Everyone's experience with menstruation is different, and it's important to respect that without judgment. The user's frustration is valid, but his approach may have been inconsiderate. He should consider whether his comment was a way to express his needs or to belittle her experience.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to validate each other's feelings. Even if one person is going through something uncomfortable, the other's needs can be addressed with compassion. The user might not be entirely wrong in feeling upset, but the manner in which he addressed the situation was likely the problem. The solution would involve open dialogue about how to manage such situations without making each other feel unappreciated or criticized.\n"
