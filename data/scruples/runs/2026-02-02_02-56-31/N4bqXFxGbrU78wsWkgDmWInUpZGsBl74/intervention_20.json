We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend when she cancels plans during her period. They planned a special date night, but she started her period and wanted to stay home. He told her that other women he's known don't act that way and she got really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. He points out that her period is causing her to cancel plans, but he mentions he usually puts up with it. However, this time he expressed frustration, which led to her emotional outburst. \n\nFrom her perspective, she's dealing with physical discomfort, cramps, etc., which are legitimate reasons to not feel up for social activities. Menstruation can be really tough for some people, and expecting her to push through might not be realistic. His comment about other women he's lived with not acting this way could come off as dismissive of her pain or her experience. Comparing her to others can be hurtful, even if he didn't mean it to be.\n\nHe might not realize that her reaction is partially due to the stress and discomfort of her period, which can make emotions more volatile. His passive-aggressive remark could have triggered her, especially if she was already feeling vulnerable. The key here is communication and understanding. He might have valid feelings about planning something and it being canceled, but the way he expressed it was probably not the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, she could have communicated her needs more clearly or shown appreciation for his effort. But given the context, it's more likely that his comment was the immediate cause of the conflict. He should consider that everyone's experience with periods is different, and his judgment might have been unfair. Apologizing and understanding her perspective would be important steps here. So, the answer would likely be that he's at fault for his comment.\n"
