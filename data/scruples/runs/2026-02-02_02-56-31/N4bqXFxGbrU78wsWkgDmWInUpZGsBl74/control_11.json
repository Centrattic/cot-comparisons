We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. They provided the full scenario where the author planned a special date night, but the girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. The author mentioned that he's had other women who didn't act this way and suggested she could put in more effort, which led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend cancels plans during her period, and he felt justified in expressing that he's seen other women handle it differently. However, his comment came off as passive-aggressive and led to a significant conflict.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's important to recognize that each person's experience with their menstrual cycle can be different. Some women might feel too unwell to go out, while others might manage it. The author's girlfriend is clearly very affected and needs rest. The fact that her period times are irregular adds to the challenge of planning.\n\nThe author's approach was to compare his current partner to past partners, implying that she's not handling it as well. This can come across as dismissive of her feelings and physical state. Even if he didn't mean to be harsh, making such a comparison can be hurtful and invalidating. It's possible he didn't realize the severity of her discomfort or the emotional impact of his words.\n\nCommunication is crucial here. The author might have wanted to express frustration about the canceled plans, but his method was flawed. Instead of acknowledging her needs and perhaps suggesting alternative plans, he criticized her, which led to her emotional outburst. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt criticized and unsupported, which is a valid response if she feels her needs aren't being considered.\n\nAdditionally, the author had already planned the date knowing her period can be unpredictable, which shows he should have some awareness of her limitations. However, the fact that he proceeded with the plan despite her cancellation that day might indicate a lack of flexibility. It's possible he didn't account for the possibility that her period might start that specific day, leading to frustration when it did.\n\nIn relationships, empathy and understanding are vital. The author's comment about other women could be seen as minimizing her experience. Everyone has different thresholds for pain and discomfort, and expecting her to push through might not be realistic or compassionate. The girlfriend's anger and crying indicate that she felt deeply hurt by his words, which might have been unnecessary.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's approach was flawed. He should have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others and tried to find a middle ground that respects her needs while also addressing his own. The answer is likely A, that he is in the wrong, because his reaction was dismissive and hurtful, even if he didn't intend to be cruel.\n"
