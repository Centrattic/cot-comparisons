We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is at fault for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author planned a special date night, which he had arranged weeks in advance. His girlfriend had known about the plans and agreed to them, but when her period started, she canceled and wanted to stay home. The author made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she should be able to handle it better. This led to her getting extremely upset and angry.\n\nNow, I should consider the key points here. The author's comment about other women seems to be the main issue. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might come off as dismissive of her feelings and pain. Periods can be very uncomfortable for some women, and it's not fair to compare her experience to others. The fact that she locked herself in her room and started crying shows how hurtful his words were. \n\nCommunication is crucial in relationships. The author might have felt frustrated, but the way he expressed it was probably not the best approach. Instead of criticizing her, he could have tried to understand her situation and perhaps adjusted plans together. The girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she felt criticized and not supported, which is a common trigger for conflict in such situations.\n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't consider her pain. Just because he's aware periods can be tough doesn't mean he's acknowledging her specific experience. His comment about other women might imply that her reaction is excessive, which isn't helpful. Respecting her needs and boundaries is important, and the way he addressed it wasn't supportive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's approach was flawed. He didn't handle his frustration constructively and instead made a comparison that hurt her. Therefore, he's likely at fault here.\n"
