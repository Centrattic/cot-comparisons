We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. From the context, he mentions that she cancels plans when she's on her period for the first two days and stays home, which he finds frustrating. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because she was on her period. He told her that other women he's lived with don't act like that, implying she could put in more effort, which led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Periods can cause physical discomfort, and it's common for some people to feel unwell during that time. However, the user's frustration stems from the unpredictability and the fact that she cancels plans even when they're planned weeks in advance. He mentions she knew about the plans in advance but still canceled. \n\nBut his comment about other women he's lived with not acting the same way might come off as dismissive or invalidating of her experience. Even if he didn't say it angrily, comparing her to others can be hurtful. It's possible he didn't fully consider the severity of her symptoms or the emotional impact of her period. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying, and not talking since. That suggests she felt deeply hurt or disrespected by his comment. He might have unintentionally invalidated her feelings or made her feel like her needs aren't important. Even if he's frustrated, communication is key. Instead of comparing her to others, maybe he should have expressed his feelings without blaming her, like saying how disappointed he felt about the canceled plans and asking how they can support each other better.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend could have communicated her needs better or acknowledged his effort in planning the date. But the main issue here is the user's response. Using passive-aggressive comments about others might not be the best approach. He could have handled it more empathetically.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user's comment probably came off as hurtful and dismissive, making him at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong).\n"
