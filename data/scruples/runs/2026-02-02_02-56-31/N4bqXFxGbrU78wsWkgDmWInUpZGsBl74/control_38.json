We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset when she cancels their plans. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend is great but has this issue during her period. He says she cancels plans without notice because her period is \"semi-random.\" He usually puts up with it, but this time he had a planned date night and she canceled. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she's not trying hard enough. That made her extremely upset, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, from what I know, menstrual cramps can be really painful for some women, making it hard to go out. The author planned a special night, but the girlfriend was already in pain. He did know about her period in advance, but maybe the day he chose for the date was the same when she got her period. The problem is that he compared her to other women, which might be hurtful. It's not fair to generalize that other women don't act this way, because every woman's experience is different. \n\nHe said he wasn't angry, just passive-aggressive. But the way he phrased it could come off as dismissive of her pain. Even if he meant to encourage her to make an effort, using other women as a benchmark isn't helpful. It might make her feel like her needs aren't valid. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend canceled the plans. If he wanted to go ahead, maybe he should have considered alternatives, like a more comfortable date at home. But he had reservations and tickets, so that's a valid point. However, her health and comfort are important. \n\nThe key here is communication. Maybe he didn't consider how his words would hurt her. Using passive-aggressive comments isn't the best approach. Even if he's frustrated, it's important to support her during her period. The fact that she got so upset suggests that his comment was a big trigger for her. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. By bringing up other women, he might have made her feel like her pain isn't being taken seriously. That's probably why she reacted so strongly. So, the author might be in the wrong here because his approach was not supportive and used a comparison that's not helpful. He should have found a way to express his feelings without belittling her experience.\n"
