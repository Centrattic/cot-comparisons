We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset because she canceled their planned date. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as great, laid-back, and they've been living together for three months. The main issue is her period causing her to cancel plans, especially this one special date. The author had plans weeks in advance, but she started her period that day and wanted to stay home. The author then made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she's overreacting. His girlfriend had a huge reaction, getting angry and crying.\n\nFrom what I know, periods can cause physical discomfort and emotional sensitivity. It's a natural part of the female cycle. Even if some women manage to go out during their period, it's not fair to compare partners. The author's comment about other women could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and physical state. \n\nHe might not have realized how hurtful his words were. By saying other women don't act this way, he's invalidating her experience. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment was a major trigger, leading to a significant argument. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of making a passive-aggressive comment, the author should have approached it with empathy. Maybe he could have expressed his disappointment in a way that acknowledges her discomfort. \n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. It's important to take responsibility for the hurt caused. The author might need to apologize and understand that everyone's body is different. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's comment was likely a key factor in the conflict. He's in the wrong because he invalidated her feelings and made a judgmental remark. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
