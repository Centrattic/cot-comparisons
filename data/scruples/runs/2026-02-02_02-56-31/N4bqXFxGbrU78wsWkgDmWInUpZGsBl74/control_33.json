We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled it because her period started that day. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this during their periods, which made her really angry. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is clearly experiencing physical discomfort, which is common during periods. Cramps can be really painful and affect a person's ability to go out or socialize. The author mentions that she cancels plans even when they have them, and her period comes at random times. So from her perspective, she might be in pain and not feeling up to going out, and it's understandable that she needs to rest.\n\nOn the other hand, the author planned something special weeks in advance, and she knew about it. He felt his effort was disregarded. But the way he approached it was to compare her behavior to other women he's known, implying that she's not making enough effort. That seems pretty hurtful. Even if he wasn't angry, saying that other women don't act like this could come off as dismissive of her pain and invalidating her experience. It's possible that she felt he was being critical of her for something she can't control.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014she was so upset that she yelled and cried. That suggests that his comment really hurt her. Maybe she felt judged or that her needs weren't being respected. The author might not realize that even though he was trying to be passive-aggressive, the message was that he's unhappy with her for something biological and beyond her control. That's probably where the conflict came from.\n\nSo, in terms of who's in the wrong, the author made a comment that was not supportive and instead critical of her for a natural bodily function. Even if he thought he was justified, comparing her to other women isn't a constructive way to handle it. The key issue here is empathy and understanding. The author didn't consider how his words might affect her, and that's likely why she reacted so strongly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he should have shown more compassion and not made a generalized comparison that invalidated her feelings and physical state.\n"
