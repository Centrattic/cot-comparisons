We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The key points here are communication, understanding, and empathy.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is experiencing period cramps and discomfort, which is a legitimate health issue. It's common for people, especially women, to feel more tired or painful during their period. The user mentions that she cancels plans even when she knows about them in advance. He tried to plan a special date night, which she had to cancel because her period started that day.\n\nThe user's response was to compare his current girlfriend to others he's lived with, implying that she's less capable of handling her period. This comparison is problematic because it dismisses her feelings and experiences. Even if other women he's known didn't act the same way, every person's experience with their body is different. Telling her that other women manage to go out while on their period can come off as dismissive and invalidating. That's a big no-no in relationships. \n\nAlso, the user used passive-aggressive comments, which can escalate tensions. The girlfriend's intense reaction\u2014crying, yelling, and locking herself in her room\u2014suggests that his words hurt her deeply. She might feel that he's not respecting her physical and emotional state, which can lead to feelings of being misunderstood or unappreciated.\n\nCommunication is key here. Instead of making comparisons, the user could have expressed his feelings and needs more constructively. For example, talking about how he feels disappointed when plans are canceled and discussing ways they can both feel supported. It's important to validate her experience without dismissing her pain, while also expressing his own needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user's comment about other women was the trigger. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive tone and content of his message were hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction, though intense, might be a result of feeling invalidated in her pain. So, the user's approach was flawed, and he should take responsibility for not handling the situation more sensitively.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. He is in the wrong because his response was dismissive and hurtful, and he should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding.\n"
