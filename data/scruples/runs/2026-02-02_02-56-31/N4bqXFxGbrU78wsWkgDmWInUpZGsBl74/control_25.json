We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together, and she sometimes cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she had her period that day and canceled. He made a comment that other women he's known don't act that way, and she got really upset. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend has a valid reason for not wanting to go out\u2014period cramps and discomfort. It's a common experience, and some women do feel that way. The author planned something nice, which is understandable. But his comment about other women he's lived with not acting the same might have been hurtful. Comparing her to others could come off as dismissive of her feelings and needs. Even if he wasn't angry, saying it passively aggressively might have made her feel like he doesn't support her during a time when she's already not feeling well.\n\nAlso, the fact that she had locked herself in her room and was crying suggests that his words really hurt her. He might not have realized how sensitive the topic is for her. It's possible that she feels misunderstood or not cared for, especially since she's in pain and he's expecting her to push through. \n\nOn the other hand, he did plan in advance and she knew about the plans. But maybe she honestly couldn't manage, despite knowing. It's a balance between respecting her health and his feelings about the plans. However, his response of comparing her to other women isn't the healthiest approach. It's important to validate her experience rather than minimize it by bringing up other women. \n\nSo, the key points here are about empathy and communication. The author might have been trying to express his disappointment but in a way that wasn't supportive. He should have tried to understand her situation better and perhaps offered alternatives, like a more comfortable date at home. Instead, he made her feel like her needs were a problem, which led to her emotional reaction. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A, because he was inconsiderate in his comment, even if he wasn't angry. Comparing her to others and implying she should put in more effort is dismissive. He should have handled the situation with more empathy. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
