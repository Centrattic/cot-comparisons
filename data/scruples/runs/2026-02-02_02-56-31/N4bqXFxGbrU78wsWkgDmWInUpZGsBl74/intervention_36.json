  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?\nFor some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the guy is in the wrong here. Let me read through his situation again carefully.\n\nHe's been living with his girlfriend for three months, and she's great except when she's on her period. For the first two days, she doesn't want to do anything, cancels plans, and just stays on the couch. He usually puts up with it because he knows women get cramps and stuff. But this time, he had planned a special date night weeks in advance, reserved dinner and movie tickets. She knew about it, but when her period started that day, she canceled. He told her, not angrily but maybe a bit passive-aggressively, that he knows other women who don't act like this, even when on their period, and that she could put in more effort for him. She completely lost it, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. He's confused and upset, wondering if he did something so bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is normally sweet and kind, but her period behavior is a problem. She cancels plans without prior arrangement, and the guy is frustrated because he made plans in advance. The key issue here is his comment about other women not acting this way. That seems like the trigger for her anger. \n\nNow, thinking about period-related symptoms. It's well-documented that many women experience severe cramps, fatigue, nausea, or other symptoms during their period, which can affect their ability to function normally. Some might have dysmenorrhea or other conditions that make it extremely difficult. The guy says he's \"lived with other women before,\" but each woman is different. What might be manageable for one could be debilitating for another. By comparing her to others, he's implying that her experience is not as valid or that she's overreacting. That can be really hurtful and invalidating, even if he didn't mean it angrily.\n\nHe made plans in advance, and she knew about them. However, her period started on that day. Even if her cycle is irregular, she might have had no way of knowing. But he's not acknowledging her current pain or discomfort. Instead, he's suggesting she should make an effort despite her situation. That's a problem because it's not just about \"acting like this\"\u2014it's about her physical state. Even if he's right that others might push through, it's not fair to hold her to that standard without considering her own health and how she feels.\n\nPassive-aggressive communication is already a red flag. When someone is in pain, the last thing they need is to feel criticized. His statement could come off as dismissive of her needs. Instead of expressing his disappointment constructively, he compared her to other women, which can be seen as belittling her experience.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, but it's not unreasonable if she felt her needs were being ignored or minimized. She might feel that he doesn't understand or respect how she feels, leading to a significant emotional response. The fact that they haven't talked since suggests a serious rift, which might have been avoided with more empathetic communication.\n\nSo, even if the guy was trying to make a point about his expectations, his approach was invalidating. He should have approached it with more empathy, perhaps acknowledging her pain and discussing how to handle future plans. Instead, he made her feel like her legitimate discomfort was being compared to others, which is disrespectful. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here.\n"
