We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He mentions that she's usually laid back but during her period, she's completely uninterested in doing anything, even if there were prior plans. The key incident was a planned date night that she canceled because she started her period that day. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's known, which led to her blowing up at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's needs are important\u2014periods can cause significant pain and discomfort, and it's common for people to feel less like socializing or being physically active during that time. However, the user had planned something weeks in advance, and she knew about it. Communication here is crucial. Did she inform him about her period schedule? The user mentions it's semi-random, so maybe she didn't know either. \n\nThe user's approach was passive-aggressive, comparing her to others. That's a problem because it's belittling and implies that her experience isn't valid. Even if he's not angry, making such a comparison can be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that his comment was a significant trigger for her. \n\nAlso, the user might have expected more effort from her without considering her pain. It's possible he didn't realize the severity of her symptoms. On the other hand, the girlfriend might need to communicate better if she's going to cancel plans last minute. But the way he addressed her was not constructive. He should have approached it with empathy rather than criticism. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. His comment about other women probably made her feel like her experiences are not understood or respected. That's a common source of conflict. So, while both parties might have valid points, the user's method of expressing his frustration was inappropriate. He should have discussed his feelings without making comparisons, which likely caused her to feel attacked. Therefore, he's in the wrong for how he handled the situation.\n"
