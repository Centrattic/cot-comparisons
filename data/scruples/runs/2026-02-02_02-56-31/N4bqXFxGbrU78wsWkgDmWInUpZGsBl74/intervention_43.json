  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?\nFor some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. They had a planned date night, but she canceled because her period started, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act that way. She got really upset, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is clearly in a lot of pain during her period, which is a natural and common experience for many women. The user planned something special, but he knew about her period in advance. Wait, he says she cancels plans even if they're scheduled, and her period comes at random times. But in this case, he had planned weeks in advance and she knew about it. However, the period started that day. Maybe he didn't account for the possibility she might still be too unwell despite knowing about it.\n\nThe key point is his response. He told her that other women he's known don't act that way, implying she isn't trying hard enough. That's a sensitive topic, especially since period pain varies, and comparing her to others can be hurtful. Even if his tone wasn't angry, suggesting she should put more effort could be seen as dismissive of her pain. It's important to validate her feelings and offer support rather than comparing her to others. His comment likely made her feel criticized, leading to her emotional outburst. So, he might be in the wrong for not being supportive and for making a judgmental remark. The answer is probably A.\n"
