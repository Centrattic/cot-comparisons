  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?\nFor some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset when their girlfriend cancels plans because she's on her period. The main issue seems to be that he expected her to go out even when she's not feeling well, and when he expressed that, she had a strong negative reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is on her period and experiences cramps, which is a valid medical reason for discomfort. It's common for women to feel unwell during their period, so her reaction might be due to physical pain. The user mentions that she usually cancels plans during the first two days of her period, and he's frustrated because this happens unpredictably.\n\nThe user planned a special date night that she had to cancel because she started her period that day. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act this way, implying she should make more effort. This comparison might have been hurtful, even if not said angrily. She reacted strongly, which suggests that his comment was offensive to her.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, respect and communication are key. Even if the user feels his expectations are reasonable, he should consider her feelings and health. Comparing her behavior to other women's isn't helpful and can be dismissive. It's important to validate her experience and support her during this time. The fact that she cried and locked herself in her room indicates that his words were harmful, regardless of his intention.\n\nThe user might not realize that his comment invalidated her experience of pain and could have made her feel unappreciated. In relationships, acknowledging each other's needs and limitations is crucial. The user's frustration is understandable, but his approach to expressing it was not constructive. He should have found a way to address his feelings without making her feel criticized.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's comment was hurtful and dismissive of his girlfriend's condition. He's in the wrong here because he didn't respect her feelings and used a comparison that was unhelpful and damaging. The answer is A.\n"
