We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did something wrong by getting upset with their girlfriend when she canceled their date night because she was on her period. They mentioned that she usually cancels plans for the first two days of her period, which she says is because of cramps. But in this case, they had planned a special date night weeks in advance, and she canceled it. The user then made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, suggesting she could put in more effort. This led to her having a huge emotional reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's girlfriend is on her period and experiencing pain. It's common for women to have discomfort during that time, which can affect their ability to engage in activities. The user had planned the date with advance notice, and she knew about it. However, when her period started, she changed her mind. The user then made a passive-aggressive comment about other women being more capable, which upset her.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The user's comment about other women, which might have come off as dismissive of her feelings. 2) The girlfriend's strong reaction, indicating that the comment hurt her feelings. 3) The fact that the user didn't consider that her period might actually cause her significant discomfort, even if it's not visible.\n\nComparing someone to others, especially in a situation where they're in pain or discomfort, can be hurtful. Even if the user's tone wasn't angry, the implication that his girlfriend is less capable or more self-indulgent than others could be seen as invalidating her experience. It's possible that the user didn't consider that her period might be more severe than others, or that she might feel guilty about canceling plans. His comment might have made her feel criticized, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might feel that he's being considerate by planning ahead and trying to accommodate her. However, the way he expressed his frustration could have been more empathetic. Instead of making a comparison, he could have discussed the situation with her to find a solution that works for both of them. The fact that he had planned the date in advance but she still canceled might have led to his frustration, but his response was not constructive.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user's comment was a passive-aggressive way of expressing his feelings, which is rarely effective. He might have assumed that his girlfriend should be able to push through the discomfort for the sake of their plans, but that's not always feasible. It's important to validate her feelings and find a middle ground. His reaction shows a lack of understanding, which is why she reacted so strongly.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user did make a mistake by making that comment. He should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding rather than making a comparison that could be perceived as judgmental. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes, he is in the wrong.\n"
