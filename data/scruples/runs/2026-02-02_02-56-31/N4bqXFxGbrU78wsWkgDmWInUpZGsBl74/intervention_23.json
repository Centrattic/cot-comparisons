We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they did something wrong by getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. They had a planned date night that she canceled, and he made a comment about other women not acting that way. She got really angry and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as usually laid back and kind, but during her period, she becomes unresponsive and cancels plans. The user had planned a special date in advance, but she canceled on that specific day. The user's comment about other women not acting that way seems to imply she's being overly sensitive or not trying hard enough. \n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. Menstrual cycles can be unpredictable, and pain levels vary. The user planned something weeks ahead, but the girlfriend's period started that day. He might have felt his efforts were unappreciated, but his approach was passive-aggressive and compared her to others, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of anger and crying is significant. She might feel disrespected or criticized for her needs. The user's comment could be seen as invalidating her experience with period pain. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark about other women might have been the trigger.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to acknowledge each other's needs and communicate support. The user's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was harsh. He didn't consider that her pain might be genuine and unchangeable. The girlfriend's health and comfort should be a priority, and expecting her to push through pain isn't fair.\n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong for not showing empathy and for making a judgmental comment. The answer would likely be A (Yes, in the wrong) because his response was disrespectful and dismissive of her health.\n"
