We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did something wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He mentions that she knows about it in advance, but one time he got impatient after planning a special date. He told her that other women he's lived with don't act this way, even on their periods, implying she could put in more effort for him. She reacted very angrily, calling him names and crying, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is experiencing period symptoms, which are real and can be severe. It's common for women to have cramps, fatigue, and other discomforts during their period. The user knows this, as he mentions he's aware of \"cramps and shit during shark week,\" which is a humorous way of referring to periods. However, she's canceling plans regularly, which is causing him frustration because he's planning ahead and she's not meeting his expectations.\n\nThe key point is when he made a comparison to other women he's lived with, suggesting that she's not meeting the standard he's observed in others. This could be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if he's not angry, saying that others don't act this way can come off as dismissive of her pain and needs. It's important to validate a partner's feelings and not compare them to others, as everyone's experience with cramps and period symptoms can vary widely. Even if other women are more active, that doesn't mean someone else is wrong for needing rest.\n\nHe might not have realized that his comment could be perceived as minimizing her pain. By suggesting she could \"put forward a little more effort,\" he's implying that her needs are less important than his plans. This can lead to resentment and hurt feelings, as she might feel her health and well-being are being disregarded. The comparison to other women is problematic because it's a classic way of belittling someone's experience by saying others handle it better.\n\nMoreover, communication is key in relationships. If he's frustrated, he should express that without comparing her to others. Instead of making passive-aggressive remarks, he should discuss his feelings and perhaps find a middle ground. For example, maybe they can have a compromise where she doesn't cancel all plans but takes it easy, or he can understand that some days she might need to rest.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt her needs were being neglected. Her crying and anger indicate deep hurt, which he might not have anticipated. It's also important to consider that she might have been feeling vulnerable and then criticized, leading to an emotional outburst.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user did say something that could be hurtful and invalidating. Even if his intention wasn't to attack her, the impact of his words was significant. Comparing her to others is often a way of undermining someone's feelings, and in this context, it likely made her feel unappreciated and misunderstood.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that he's in the wrong because his comment was dismissive and invalidating of her experience. He should work on understanding her needs better and communicate his own feelings without making comparisons.\n"
