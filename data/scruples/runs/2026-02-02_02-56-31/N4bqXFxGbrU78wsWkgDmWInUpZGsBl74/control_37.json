We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author's main issue is getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. He mentions that she usually stays home for the first two days, which he's been putting up with. However, there was a specific instance where he had planned a special date night weeks in advance, and she canceled it because her period started that day. The author told her that he's been with other women who don't act like this during their periods, implying she could try harder. This led to a major argument where she was very upset and angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend has a medical condition (menstrual cramps) that's affecting her ability to go out. The author planned something special, which is understandable, but he's comparing her behavior to other women he's known. The problem here is that he's essentially criticizing her for a natural bodily function that's causing her pain. Even if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting this way is judgmental. It's important to recognize that period cramps can be severe and vary from person to person. What works for one woman might not for another. Also, the author is dismissing her needs for the sake of his plans, which shows a lack of empathy.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that the author's comment hit a nerve, possibly because she felt invalidated or criticized. The fact that they haven't talked since indicates ongoing tension. The author's justification is that he's making a fair point about effort, but he didn't communicate this in a supportive way. Instead, he made a comparison that might have been hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, communication and understanding are key. The author could have expressed his feelings without comparing her to others. He should have validated her feelings instead of implying she should try harder. The fact that he planned something special shows he wants to spend quality time, but he needs to balance that with her health and comfort. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was dismissive of her legitimate medical needs and used a comparison that's not fair. He's in the wrong for not showing empathy and for making a passive-aggressive remark that hurt her feelings. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
