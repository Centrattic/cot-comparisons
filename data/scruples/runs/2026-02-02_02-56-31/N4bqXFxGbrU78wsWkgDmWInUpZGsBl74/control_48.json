We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He set up a special date night, but she called it off because she was on her period. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act that way, and she got really angry.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective is that he planned something special weeks in advance, she knew about it, but still canceled. He felt justified because he thinks other women manage to go out even when they're on their period. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014she was upset, cried, and locked herself in her room. That suggests the comment really hurt her.\n\nFrom a general perspective, period-related discomfort is a real issue for many women. Cramps can be debilitating, and everyone's experience is different. The author might not realize how sensitive this issue is. Comparing her to other women could come off as dismissive of her pain or as implying she's being overly dramatic. Even if said passively-aggressively, the underlying message is that she should be doing more, which can feel invalidating.\n\nThe key points here: The author planned ahead, but the girlfriend's health issue arose despite that. The comment about other women is likely what triggered the outburst. Even if the author didn't mean to be harsh, the way he phrased his frustration might have crossed a line. Empathy is important here. The girlfriend might feel that her needs are being neglected, especially since she's in pain. The author should have considered her feelings and maybe been more supportive rather than making a comparison.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is strong, but it's possible that the author's comment hit a nerve. She might feel judged or criticized for her natural bodily functions, which can be a sensitive topic. The author might not fully grasp the emotional impact of his words. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive tone could have made her feel defensive or attacked.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have approached the situation with more understanding, perhaps expressing his disappointment without comparing her to others. It's important to validate her feelings instead of questioning her ability to cope. So, the author's mistake was in how he communicated his frustration rather than the fact that he was upset about canceled plans.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. He should have been more empathetic and chosen his words differently to avoid hurting her. Comparing her to other women is a common mistake that can lead to feelings of inadequacy or being misunderstood. The girlfriend's intense reaction is a sign that the comment was deeply hurtful, and the author needs to take responsibility for that.\n"
