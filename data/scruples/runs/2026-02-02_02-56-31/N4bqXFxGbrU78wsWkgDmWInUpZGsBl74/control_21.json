We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation involves them living together for three months, and the main issue is her period affecting their plans. The author mentions she cancels plans when she's on her period, and he's frustrated because she canceled a special date he planned. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's known who don't act that way, which led to her blowing up at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author planned a special date, which the girlfriend canceled due to her period. The author's frustration is understandable because he had invested time and effort. However, his approach was to compare her to other women, implying she's not trying hard enough. This is problematic because it invalidates her experience and pain. Even if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive comment could be hurtful. \n\nPeriods can cause significant physical and emotional discomfort, and everyone experiences them differently. The fact that she cancels plans when she's unwell is a valid reason. The author's comment about other women suggests he might have unrealistic expectations, not considering that individual differences exist. His girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that the comment was deeply hurtful. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. Instead of making comparative remarks, the author should have expressed his feelings without invalidating her. He could have discussed his feelings about the canceled plans and maybe found a compromise next time. However, in this instance, his approach was inconsiderate. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but it's a response to feeling criticized. The author's statement, though not shouted, could have been perceived as dismissive of her pain. Comparing her to others in a situation where she's unwell might come across as insensitive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's comment was inconsiderate, even if his intention wasn't to be mean. The key issue is that he didn't support her during her period but instead criticized her behavior. That's where he went wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
