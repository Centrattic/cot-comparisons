We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He mentions that she's usually laid back, but this specific incident led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The girlfriend has been canceling plans for the first two days of her period, which the user has put up with. But this time, he had a planned date that she canceled, and he expressed frustration, comparing her to other women he's lived with. That comparison might be key here. He's implying she's not trying hard enough, which can come off as dismissive of her physical discomfort.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying, locking herself in. That suggests the comment really hurt her. Even if the user wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark about other women not acting that way might have felt like a criticism of her behavior, which is sensitive during her period. \n\nIt's important to recognize that everyone experiences their period differently. Cramps and symptoms can be severe for some, and it's not fair to compare one person's experience to another's. The user's comment about other women might have invalidated her feelings, making her feel unappreciated or misunderstood. \n\nAdditionally, the user had planned the date weeks in advance, and she knew about it. But if she was genuinely too unwell to go out, expecting her to push through might be unreasonable. However, communication is key. The user's approach was to make a comparison rather than express his feelings without judgment. \n\nThe girlfriend's extreme reaction indicates that the comment struck a nerve. The user's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might have been hurtful. It's possible he didn't fully consider how his words would affect her. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to validate each other's experiences. Even if the user is upset about canceled plans, dismissing her experience with periods as something others handle better could be seen as invalidating her pain. The core issue might be about communication and empathy rather than the act of canceling plans itself.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The user did make a comment that compared his girlfriend to others, which might have invalidated her feelings, leading to a big argument. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive approach wasn't the best. He should have discussed his feelings without making comparisons. Therefore, he's in the wrong for how he expressed his frustration.\n"
