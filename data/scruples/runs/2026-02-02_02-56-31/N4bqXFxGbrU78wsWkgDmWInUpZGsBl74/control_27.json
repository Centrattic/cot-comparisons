We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who cancels plans when she's on her period, and the guy gets upset because she's not making an effort. The key points here are understanding both sides.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she's on her period for a couple of days and doesn't want to go out, even if they had plans. She cancels last-minute, which the guy had planned weeks in advance. He mentions she knew about the plans in advance. Now, periods can be really tough with cramps and pain, so it's understandable she might not feel up to going out. But the guy's response was to compare her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not trying hard enough. That's where the conflict came from.\n\nThe guy says he wasn't angry, just a bit passive-aggressive. But his comment about other women not acting like this is probably the trigger. Even if he's not shouting, making her feel like she's not measuring up compared to others is hurtful. It's dismissive of her experience and implies that her pain isn't valid unless she's pushing through it. That's a red flag because it's not empathetic.\n\nThen there's the reaction: she flipped out, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. His confusion is about whether he's in the wrong. The crux here is whether comparing her to other women and questioning her effort is valid. From a relationship standpoint, empathy and understanding are crucial. The guy's comment was a judgment of her actions, not a validation of her feelings. Even if he's frustrated, the way he expressed it was invalidating. She's in pain, and he's holding her to a standard he's observed in others, which isn't fair. She has the right to feel unwell and not force herself to go out if she's in pain.\n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since suggests the communication broke down. He needs to take responsibility for his part in escalating the situation. The answer is likely A because he was inconsiderate and didn't support her, instead criticizing her for her natural reaction to pain. The key is that he should have been more understanding rather than comparing her to others.\n"
