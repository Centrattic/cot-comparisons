We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The girlfriend doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period, even canceling plans she knew about weeks in advance. The author planned a special date night, but she canceled it because her period started that day. He expressed his frustration by saying he's met other women who don't act this way, implying she should put in more effort. This led to her having a strong emotional reaction, including yelling and crying.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. He planned something special, which is understandable. However, his comment about other women comparing to his girlfriend's behavior comes off as passive-aggressive and dismissive of her needs. Even if he was trying to be calm, the implication that she's not making enough effort is invalidating. He's not respecting her boundaries during a time she's physically uncomfortable. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she's in pain and needs rest. Canceling plans because of her period is a legitimate reason. The author's frustration is misplaced because he's not acknowledging her health and well-being. His comparison to other women is inappropriate and could be seen as blaming her for her natural bodily functions. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed his feelings without undermining her experience. Instead, he made a generalization that likely hurt her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a sign that his words were hurtful and crossed a line. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't validate her needs and made a judgmental comment that caused her distress. The answer should be A.\n"
