  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?\nFor some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset when his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. So first, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe user's side: He's frustrated because his girlfriend cancels all plans for the first two days of her period, even if they're pre-scheduled. He mentions that he knows periods are tough, but this time he had a special dinner and movie plans that she canceled. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act this way, which led to her blowing up at him.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective: She's dealing with period cramps, which can be really painful and make it hard to do anything. She cancels plans, which is understandable. But the user compared her to other women, which might have felt dismissive of her experience.\n\nSo, when someone is in pain, expecting them to go out might be unreasonable. The user's comment about other women could have made her feel criticized, which is a common trigger for arguments. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have hurt her feelings. She locked herself in her room and was upset, showing the impact of his words.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and communication. The user might not have considered how his words affected her, even if his intention was to express his frustration. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt disrespected or invalidated. So, even though he had valid feelings about the plans, the way he expressed them was harmful.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. Saying others don't act that way implies her actions are wrong, which isn't helpful. The user should have discussed his feelings without comparing her to others. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong here. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
