We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. She canceled a planned date because she was on her period, and he expressed frustration that other women he's known don't act that way. She had a strong reaction, yelling and crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is described as usually laid-back and nice. She's been on her period for the first two days, which he says she doesn't do anything during. He's had to cancel plans before because of this. But this time, he had a special date planned weeks in advance, and she canceled it again. He mentioned other women he's lived with don't act like this, implying she's not making an effort. She reacted very angrily.\n\nNow, from a societal perspective, periods can cause significant physical discomfort. Cramps, fatigue, mood swings are common. It's understandable that someone might not feel up to going out or being social during the worst days. However, the key issue here is communication and sensitivity. The user planned a date knowing her cycle, but maybe he didn't account for her pain. Or maybe he didn't realize the severity of her symptoms. \n\nWhen he said other women don't act like this, that's where the problem likely escalated. Comparing her to others can be hurtful, even if not done angrily. It might make her feel judged or like her experience isn't valid. She might feel like he's dismissing her pain or not respecting her needs. \n\nHe might not be wrong in feeling frustrated, especially if this has happened before. But the way he expressed it was a trigger. Instead of being supportive, he criticized her in a way that made her feel unappreciated. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He should have discussed his feelings without comparing her to others. Maybe they could have found a compromise next time. But in this case, the comment about other women did cross a line. So he's probably at fault here. Answer A.\n"
