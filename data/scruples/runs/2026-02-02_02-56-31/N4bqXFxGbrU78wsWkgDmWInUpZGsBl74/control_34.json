We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she canceled their plans when she was on her period. The key points here are his expectations and how he communicated them.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend usually cancels plans during her period, which he's been putting up with. But this time, he planned a special date night and she canceled again. He told her that other women he's known didn't act that way and implied she should try harder. That led to her emotional outburst.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about communication. Even though the author might not have intended to be harsh, he made a comparison to other women, which is a common trigger for relationship conflicts. People often feel judged when someone brings up comparisons. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this was a sensitive topic for her, maybe feeling invalidated or criticized. \n\nThe author might not have considered her feelings deeply enough. While it's true that period-related discomfort is common, expecting her to push through physical pain to meet his expectations could be unreasonable. However, the way he approached it\u2014by comparing her to others and implying she's not trying hard enough\u2014definitely crossed a line. \n\nIn relationships, how we express our needs and frustrations matters a lot. Instead of making her feel like she's doing something wrong, the author should have expressed his disappointment and discussed their expectations together. His passive-aggressive comment likely made her feel attacked, which explains her strong reaction. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to express his feelings, the method and words he used were harmful. The girlfriend's emotional response indicates that his approach was hurtful and invalidating. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
