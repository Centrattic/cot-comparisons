We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. They planned a special date night, but she ended up canceling due to her period and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act that way. She got really angry and there's been a rift.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and sensitivity. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that the comment struck a nerve. Even if the user's intention was to express frustration, comparing her to other women and implying she should try harder could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and pain. Periods can be really uncomfortable, and everyone experiences them differently. What might seem like a small inconvenience to one person can be debilitating for another.\n\nThe user says they usually put up with it, but this time they got impatient. The girlfriend knew about the plans in advance, yet her period started that day. Maybe the user's comment came off as invalidating her experience. Even if the user didn't mean to be harsh, pointing out that others don't act the same way could make her feel like her pain isn't real or important. That's a common issue in relationships where one partner's discomfort isn't acknowledged properly.\n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend is usually sweet and kind but had such an intense reaction indicates that the user's words crossed a line. It's possible she felt judged or like she wasn't being supported. The user should probably take responsibility for not being considerate enough in their approach. They could have expressed their feelings without comparing her to others, maybe suggesting alternative ways to spend the evening that accommodate her condition instead of just expecting her to push through.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's approach was flawed. They didn't handle the situation with enough empathy, leading to a hurtful reaction. Therefore, they are likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
