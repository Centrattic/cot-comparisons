We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend is very laid back, but during her period, she cancels everything and doesn't want to do anything. The author planned a special date night, but she canceled it because her period started. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she should make more effort. She reacted extremely, calling him names and crying.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's main issue is that he expected her to go out despite her period, which she found too painful. He mentions she's been like this for the first two days, but this time he got impatient. He made plans weeks in advance, and she knew about them. However, when her period came, she couldn't go. The author compared her to other women he's lived with, suggesting she's not trying hard enough. \n\nFrom a general perspective, period cramps can be really painful and affect people differently. It's a medical issue for some, not just a matter of willpower. The author's comment about other women could come off as dismissive of her actual pain. Even if he wasn't angry, saying it passively-aggressively might have hurt her feelings. She was in pain and couldn't do what he wanted, and he's trying to compare her experience to others, which might not be fair because everyone's body is different.\n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows how hurtful his words were. Her reaction was extreme, but it's possible she felt invalidated. The author might not understand the severity of her cramps. He might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and physical state, and for making a comparison that could be seen as minimizing her experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had planned something special and was disappointed. But he should have communicated better instead of making her feel bad. The key is whether his actions were respectful. Comparing her to others isn't helpful and can be hurtful. So, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
