We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset because she canceled their plans. He mentioned that he's had other women in his life who didn't act that way, implying she should put in more effort. She then reacted very angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is in pain during her period, which is a valid reason to not feel like doing much. The author planned a special date night weeks in advance, which the girlfriend knew about, but she was on her period that day. He's frustrated because she canceled. However, the key point here is his comment about other women he's known not acting this way. That seems dismissive of her feelings and physical state. Comparing her to others is often a red flag in relationships because it can come off as invalidating. \n\nThe author's approach, even if not angry, was passive-aggressive and made her feel criticized. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling attacked or not supported. The author didn't consider her situation and instead focused on his own disappointment, which shows a lack of empathy. \n\nIn relationships, communication and understanding are crucial. Expecting someone to push through physical discomfort, especially when it's common for many women, can be unreasonable. The author's statement about other women suggests he's holding her to an unrealistic standard, which is unfair. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate and dismissive of his girlfriend's needs. He should have been more supportive rather than making a comparison. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
