We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. He set up a special date night, but she canceled because her period started that day. He compared her to other women he's lived with, implying she should try harder, and she blew up at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has been on her period for the first two days, which is a common time for cramps and fatigue. She cancels plans, which the user is frustrated about. He mentions she knows in advance, but the period timing is unpredictable. His response was passive-aggressive, pointing out that other women don't act this way.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. Menstrual cycles can be unpredictable and accompanied by severe pain that affects daily activities. The user's frustration is understandable, but his approach might have been dismissive of her physical discomfort. Comparing her to other women could come off as invalidating her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment might have triggered her because it questioned her legitimacy of feeling unwell.\n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that this issue is sensitive for her. She might feel her feelings and experiences are not being respected. The user's comment could have made her feel like she's being blamed for her body's natural process. Even if his intent was to encourage her to try harder, it's possible he didn't consider how that advice would land, given her current physical state.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other during health issues is crucial. The user's expectation might not account for the severity of her symptoms. It's important to validate her feelings and find a compromise rather than comparing her to others. The user might have overstepped by implying she's not making enough effort, which could be seen as dismissive of her actual pain.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user's approach likely hurt her feelings and undermined her experience. He should take responsibility for his words and work on understanding her needs during her period. Therefore, the answer is A, he is in the wrong.\n"
