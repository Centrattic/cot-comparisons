We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. The key points here are the girlfriend's behavior during her period and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is described as generally kind and laid back, except during her period. She cancels plans for the first two days, which the author finds frustrating. In this specific instance, they had a planned date night that she canceled, leading to an argument. The author mentioned that he knows other women who don't act like this, implying that he's holding her to a different standard. That's probably where the issue lies.\n\nThe author's comment about other women is the problem. Comparing her to others can come off as dismissive and invalidating her feelings. Even if it wasn't said angrily, the passive-aggressive tone likely hurt her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that she felt criticized and judged about her body's natural processes. \n\nPeriods can be really painful and affect people differently. While some might handle it better, it's not fair to expect someone to push through discomfort unless they feel up to it. The author planned a special night, which is valid, but maybe he should have been more flexible. However, the way he reacted\u2014bringing up comparisons\u2014was probably the main issue here. \n\nThe girlfriend's anger and crying indicate that she felt attacked. The author's statement that she could put in more effort might have come across as minimizing her pain. It's important to validate her feelings rather than compare her to others. So in terms of right or wrong, the author probably crossed a line by invalidating her experience, even if his intention was to express his own frustration. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
