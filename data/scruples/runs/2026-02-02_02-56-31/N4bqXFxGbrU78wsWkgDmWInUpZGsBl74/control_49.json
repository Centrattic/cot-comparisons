We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been living together for three months. He mentions that she's usually great, but during her period, she cancels plans and stays home. He tried to plan a special date night, but she canceled because her period started that day. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not making enough effort. She had a strong negative reaction, yelling and crying.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and empathy. The author planned something special, which is understandable. However, his girlfriend was experiencing pain and discomfort, which is a valid reason to not want to go out. \n\nWhen he told her that other women don't act this way, even during their periods, he was essentially invalidating her feelings. That's a big issue. Everyone's experience with period cramps can vary, and comparing her to others is dismissive. It shows a lack of empathy and understanding. \n\nHe mentions that her period comes at a semi-random time, so he should know that planning around it is tricky. But he did plan the date knowing she might have her period. However, she might have thought she was okay on that day. Either way, when she canceled, his reaction was to bring up other women, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's response, while intense, might be a result of feeling criticized and not supported. The author's comment could have made her feel like her pain isn't legitimate. The fact that they haven't talked since suggests a breakdown in communication.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other through challenges. The author's approach here was to express his disappointment in a way that undermined her experience. Even if his intention wasn't to be harsh, the message came across as dismissive. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong. He should have approached the situation with more understanding and empathy instead of comparing her to others. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
