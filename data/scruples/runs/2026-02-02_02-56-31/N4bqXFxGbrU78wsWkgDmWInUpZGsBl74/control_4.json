We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend is on her period for two days and cancels plans. He mentions she's usually laid-back but this is a recurring issue. The key event is the planned date night that she cancels, and he comments that other women he's lived with don't act this way, leading to an argument.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's view, he planned something special and felt it was fair to expect some effort from her, even during her period. But from her side, she's dealing with physical discomfort and chooses to rest, which is a common experience for many women. His comment about other women might come off as dismissive of her feelings and invalidates her experience.\n\nThe author's statement about his past experiences with other women could be seen as making a comparison that's hurtful. Even if he didn't mean it angrily, the implication that his current girlfriend isn't handling her period as well as others might be the root of her anger. It's important to recognize that pain and discomfort are subjective, and comparing experiences isn't helpful.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. The author expressed his feelings in a way that might have been passive-aggressive, and the girlfriend reacted strongly. The fact that she rarely gets upset suggests that the comment hit a nerve. Also, periods can be unpredictable, which the author acknowledges, but he still expected her to stick to plans despite the known challenges.\n\nIn relationships, empathy and understanding are crucial. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but his approach in expressing that could be the issue. The main point is that comparing partners to others can be hurtful and doesn't account for individual experiences. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong for his statement, even if his intention wasn't to be malicious. So, AITA would be answer A.\n"
