We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, and the girlfriend cancels plans for the first two days of her period. The user planned a special date night that was already scheduled weeks in advance. The girlfriend had her period that day and canceled. The user made a comment comparing her to other women they've lived with, suggesting she could put in more effort. The girlfriend had a strong negative reaction, leading to a fight.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the user's side, they planned something special and felt let down. They might feel that their effort was unappreciated and that the girlfriend didn't make an effort. However, from the girlfriend's side, dealing with period pain and discomfort is valid. Even if others don't react the same way, it's her body and her experience. The user's comment about other women could come off as dismissive of her feelings, implying that her reaction is excessive compared to others.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The user's comment might have invalidated the girlfriend's experience, leading to her emotional response. Even if the user wasn't angry, using passive-aggressive remarks about others can be hurtful. The girlfriend might feel criticized for her natural reaction to pain, which can be isolating. It's important to recognize that everyone's experience with menstrual cramps varies, and comparing to others doesn't help.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the user probably made a mistake in how they communicated their feelings. Instead of comparing to others, expressing their feelings without judgment would have been better. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the comment was hurtful, indicating that the user's approach was flawed. Therefore, the answer would be A (in the wrong) because the user's comment was dismissive and lacked empathy.\n"
