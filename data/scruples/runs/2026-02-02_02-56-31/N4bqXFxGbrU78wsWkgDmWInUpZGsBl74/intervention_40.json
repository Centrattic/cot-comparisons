We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset because their girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. They had a special date night planned, but she canceled because she started her period that day. He mentioned that he's lived with other women who didn't act the same way, so he thought she could put in more effort. His girlfriend reacted extremely,\u9a82\u4ed6\u5e76\u54ed\u4e86\uff0cand they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his actions. He planned something special weeks in advance, which she knew about. She canceled because of her period, which she might be experiencing for the first two days. He said he wasn't angry but maybe passive-aggressive. The key issue here is comparing her behavior to other women. Even though periods are common, the severity can vary. Some people have debilitating cramps, others less so. By implying that other women he's known don't act this way, he's suggesting she's not handling it well, which can feel invalidating.\n\nHe might not realize that his comment about other women could be hurtful. Women's experiences with periods are different; some might still go out despite cramps, but others might not. By bringing up other women, he's making a comparison that's not fair or supportive. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt disrespected or invalidated. He expressed frustration, but the way he did it by comparing to others might have been the trigger.\n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. He's now upset and unsure what to do. The core of the issue is communication and empathy. He needs to understand that his comment, even if not meant to be harsh, could have made her feel like her pain wasn't acknowledged. On the other hand, she could have communicated her needs better, but his response was a catalyst for the argument.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer hinges on whether his comment was the wrong action. Since he made a comparison that could invalidate her experience, even if he didn't mean to, it's likely he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
