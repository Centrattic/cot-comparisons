We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He set up a special date night, but she canceled because her period started that day. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act that way, which led to a huge fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend has a valid reason\u2014period cramps can be really painful and make someone feel unwell. It's understandable that she might not feel up for going out. The user planned this date in advance, which he had put effort into. But his comment about other women implies that her reaction is excessive or that she's not trying hard enough. That could be seen as invalidating her experience.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, being told that other women don't act this way might feel dismissive of her pain. It's possible she felt criticized for her natural bodily response. The user's comment might have come off as passive-aggressive, even if he wasn't angry, which could have escalated her emotions.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user's approach here might not have been the best. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have expressed his feelings about the canceled plans and asked if there was a way to still connect without going out. By making a comparison, he might have made her feel like her needs aren't valid, which can hurt and lead to defensiveness.\n\nAlso, the user mentions her period comes at a \"semi-random time.\" It's possible he's not fully aware of how unpredictable periods can be, which might affect planning. But expecting her to push through discomfort to meet his plans could be unrealistic. However, the way he expressed his frustration was harmful because it undermined her experience.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's comment was likely the trigger for her outburst. He was trying to express his feelings but did so in a way that invalidated her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not validating her feelings and making a comparative statement that hurt her.\n"
