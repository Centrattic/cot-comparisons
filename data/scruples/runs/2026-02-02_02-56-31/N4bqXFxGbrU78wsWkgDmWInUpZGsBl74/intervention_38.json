  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?\nFor some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. They had a planned date night that she canceled because her period started that day. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she could make more effort. She got really upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is experiencing period cramps, which can be really painful. Some people do experience severe cramps that make daily activities difficult, and it's not uncommon for people to feel like they need rest. However, the user points out that this happens every time, and this particular instance was a planned date that he had prepared weeks in advance. \n\nBut maybe the user's comment about other women not acting like that is the problem. Comparing her to others could be hurtful because it might make her feel like her needs aren't valid. Even if he wasn't angry, saying that other women are better at putting in effort could imply that she's not trying hard enough. That could be really hurtful because it's not just about the period itself but how her feelings are being invalidated.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned that her period comes at a \"semi-random time every month,\" so maybe it's irregular. That could make planning difficult for both of them. But by saying that others don't act like this, he might have dismissed her legitimate pain. Even if she can sometimes manage to go out, if she's in severe pain, it's understandable she'd want to stay home. The user's frustration is valid because he put effort into planning, but his approach might have been insensitive.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Maybe the user should have talked about his feelings without comparing her to others. Instead of saying other women don't cancel, he could have expressed that he felt disappointed but understood her situation. The way he framed it might have come off as critical rather than empathetic. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but her emotional response could be a result of feeling judged and invalidated. If she's usually laid back and kind, a sudden outburst might indicate that she felt her needs weren't respected. The user's comment might have triggered her stress or made her feel like she's a burden. \n\nIn relationships, how we express our needs and feelings matters a lot. Even if the user's intention was to express his feelings, the method of using comparison might have been the issue. It's possible that he didn't realize how hurtful that comparison would be, but in doing so, he invalidated her experience. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user might be in the wrong because his comment could have made his girlfriend feel disrespected and invalidated. Even if he didn't mean to be harsh, the passive-aggressive remark about other women might have been the catalyst for her emotional reaction. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
