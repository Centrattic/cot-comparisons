I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend's dad died a few months ago, and she's been trying to cope. The author isn't religious, and the girlfriend isn't either, but her family is very religious. She used to go to church with them when they wanted her to. Now, she asked the author to go to church with her on Easter because that's a tradition her family has every year. The author refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. He argued that since she isn't very religious either, they don't need to go. This led to a big fight, and now the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's father just died. Grief can make people cling to traditions and rituals as a way to cope. Even if she isn't very religious now, the tradition of going to church with her family might be a way for her to find comfort during this time. The author, while trying to support her, refused to participate in an activity that she had requested. Even if the author isn't religious, supporting her in her chosen coping mechanisms could be important. \n\nThe author says the girlfriend even told him she doesn't really want to go, which is confusing. Maybe she's going out of tradition or pressure from her family, but still asked him to accompany her for emotional support. If the author is not there, she might feel more isolated. However, if she genuinely doesn't want to go, then maybe the author's refusal is justified. But the problem here is the communication. The author might not have considered her emotional needs as much as his own beliefs. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author said they don't need to go now because she's not religious shows a lack of empathy. It's possible that the tradition is more about her family's expectations or her personal grief processing rather than religious belief. The author's refusal could be interpreted as not respecting her need to follow through with a tradition that's important to her during a difficult time. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not religious and might feel like he's compromising his beliefs by attending. But in a relationship, there's often a need to compromise, especially for the emotional well-being of a partner. The key here is whether the author's refusal was dismissive of her feelings. Even if the author is not religious, attending the service might not require him to believe in the religion, just to be present for her. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt the author wasn't supportive. The author might have failed to recognize that participating in the church service was a way for her to connect with her family's tradition and her late father's memory, regardless of her personal religious beliefs. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because he refused to support his girlfriend's emotional needs during a time of grief, even if it's not based on his personal beliefs. The answer could be A (the author is in the wrong). However, if the girlfriend truly didn't want to go, then maybe the author is right. But given the context of her father's death and the importance of traditions in grief, the author's refusal might be seen as insensitive. The fact that the girlfriend is upset and the situation turned into a fight indicates that the author's actions hurt her feelings, making him at least partially to blame.\n"
