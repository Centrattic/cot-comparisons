I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her father died. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend isn't very religious\u2014she only goes to church on major holidays like Christmas and Easter, but her family is religious. Her father recently passed away, and she's trying to cope. The key event here is that she asked her non-religious boyfriend to go to church with her on Easter, but he refused because he doesn't believe and doesn't want to sit through the service. \n\nThe author argues that since their girlfriend isn't super religious and even said she doesn't really want to go, he sees no point in attending. However, this led to a big fight about traditions, and she's upset. The question is, is he wrong?\n\nLooking at the situation, the girlfriend's request seems to be about connecting with her family's traditions, especially during a time of grief. The boyfriend's refusal might be seen as not being supportive, even if his reasons are based on his lack of belief. While respecting personal beliefs is important, being a supportive partner might involve making some compromises. \n\nThe girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she felt he wasn't respecting her traditions. Even if she's not very religious, the act of going to church with her family might be significant for her emotional well-being during this time. The boyfriend might not be wrong in his beliefs, but in the context of the relationship and supporting her needs, he might have failed to show the support she needed. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because not attending could be seen as not supporting her during a difficult time, despite his own beliefs. But maybe there's a middle ground, like attending a different church or a shorter service. However, since the decision was made to refuse and it caused conflict, it's likely the author is in the wrong.\n"
