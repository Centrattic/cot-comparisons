I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't go to church with their girlfriend after her dad's death is in the wrong. The situation is that they're both not very religious, but her family is. She wanted to go to church on Easter, which is a tradition for her family, but he refused because he doesn't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through the service. Now they're fighting about it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about respect for traditions and the girlfriend's emotional needs. Even if he's not religious, supporting her during a time of grief might involve respecting her traditions. She mentioned that her family has always been religious and she used to go with them. Now, after her father's death, attending church might be important for her healing process. He says she doesn't really want to go, but maybe that's not the case. She might need the support, even if she's not fully religious.\n\nBut wait, he did say he wants to be there for her. So maybe he didn't consider that attending the service could be a way to support her, even if he's not religious. The fact that she's upset and crying shows that his refusal hurt her feelings. Even if he doesn't believe, making an effort to attend might show solidarity. On the other hand, forcing himself to go against his beliefs might be a point. But in relationships, sometimes you compromise, especially when it's about your partner's emotional needs.\n\nSo, the question is whether his refusal is a breach of support. Since she's struggling with grief and the tradition is important to her, not attending could be seen as not supporting her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But then again, if he's genuinely not willing to participate, is that fair? It's a balance between respecting her needs and his own beliefs. However, in a relationship, supporting each other's important traditions is often expected. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
