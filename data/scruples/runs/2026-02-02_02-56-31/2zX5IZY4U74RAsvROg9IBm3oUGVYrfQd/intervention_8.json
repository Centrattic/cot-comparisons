I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They're not very religious, and neither is she, but her family is. She went to church sometimes, like on holidays. Her dad passed, and she wanted to go to Easter church with him. He refused, saying he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe. Now she's upset, crying, and it's a big fight.\n\nHmm, so the key points here: her dad's death might make this more emotional. Even though they're not religious, she's reaching out for support during a tough time. He's there for her but refused to attend church. She said she doesn't really want to go either, but maybe it's about honoring her family's tradition or her feelings.\n\nHe might be in the wrong because he dismissed her request without considering the emotional aspect. It's not just about the church service but showing support. Even if he's not religious, going to church could be important for her to process grief. By saying they don't need to go because she's not religious, he might be invalidating her needs. The fact that she's crying and sulking shows it hurt her feelings. So even if he's not wrong in his beliefs, his refusal might have been insensitive. The answer is probably A, he's in the wrong.\n"
