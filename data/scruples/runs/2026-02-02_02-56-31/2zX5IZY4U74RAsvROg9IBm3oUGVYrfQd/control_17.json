I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should have gone to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. Both are not very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, which she did with her family every year. The author refused because they don't believe and don't want to sit through the service. Now the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they don't want to go to church because they don't believe and don't want to sit through the service. They also said she's not that religious. But the girlfriend was trying to connect with her family's tradition, especially after her dad's death. Even though she says she doesn't really want to go, she asked him to go with her, which might be about emotional support, not just the religion. \n\nThe author might not be considering that for the girlfriend, going to church is a way to grieve or honor her dad, even if she's not religious. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her emotionally. Also, the girlfriend's reaction (crying, sulking) suggests it's important to her. The author says they want to be there for her, but not going to church when she asked might contradict that. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't religious and might have a right to their beliefs. But in a relationship, sometimes you need to compromise for your partner's emotional needs. The question is whether not going was a breach of support. Since the girlfriend was trying to handle her grief and her family's traditions, the author's refusal could be seen as not respecting her needs in this time of loss. So maybe the author is in the wrong.\n"
