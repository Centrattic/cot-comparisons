I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The main points here are about the girlfriend's feelings, their relationship dynamics, and the importance of traditions versus personal beliefs.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's family is very religious, and she used to go to church with them, especially during holidays like Easter. Her dad passed away, and this Easter is significant for her family. The girlfriend asked her partner to accompany her to church, but he refused, stating he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. He also mentioned that she's not very religious now, so they don't need to go. This led to a fight and her emotional reaction.\n\nFrom the partner's perspective, he's being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to participate in something he doesn't believe in. However, the key issue here is the girlfriend's emotional state. After losing her father, attending church might be a way for her to find comfort or connect with her family's traditions. Even if she says she doesn't want to go, the act of asking and being refused might make her feel unsupported, especially during a vulnerable time.\n\nThe partner's refusal could be seen as dismissive of her emotional needs, even if his reasons are based on his own beliefs. In a relationship, supporting each other through significant life events, especially when it's important to the other person, is crucial. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests that his refusal hurt her feelings. Even if he's not religious, showing up as a supportive partner could be more important than the actual participation in the service.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the partner has the right to stick to his beliefs and that the girlfriend should respect that. But the context of her father's death adds a layer of emotional sensitivity. The partner's response might come off as not being there for her during a tough time, which could damage the relationship. So, while his actions are understandable from a personal belief standpoint, the way he handled it might be inconsiderate of her emotional needs.\n"
