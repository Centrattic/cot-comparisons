I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're at fault for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. Both aren't very religious\u2014she goes occasionally, especially for big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is more religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad passed away recently, and she asked the author to go to church with her on Easter since she couldn't fly home. The author refused because they don't want to sit through the service and don't believe in it. They argued about traditions, and the girlfriend is upset now.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about empathy, respect, and understanding. The author says they want to be there for her, which is good, but maybe they didn't consider the emotional significance of the request. Even if she's not religious, going to church might be a way for her to honor her dad's memory or follow family traditions during a tough time. The author might have dismissed her request without fully understanding her emotional needs. Also, the girlfriend mentioned she doesn't want to go, but maybe she still felt the need to go through the motions for her family or her grief. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her in her way of coping, even if it's not their belief system. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't prioritize her emotional comfort in this situation, even if they have their own beliefs. But then again, it's important to respect one's own convictions too. However, in a relationship, sometimes compromising is necessary, especially during someone's grieving process. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
