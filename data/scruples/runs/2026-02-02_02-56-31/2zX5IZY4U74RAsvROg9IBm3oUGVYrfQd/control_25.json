I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them often. Her dad recently died, and this Easter is the first time she can't go home. She asked her non-religious partner to go with her. The person in question refused because they don't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through the service. They told her she doesn't need to go if she's not religious. This led to a big argument, and now she's upset.\n\nSo the key points here are about respecting traditions and emotional support. The girlfriend might be using the church service as a way to connect with her family's traditions or to honor her father's memory. Even if she's not super religious, the act of going to church might be meaningful to her as part of her grieving process. The partner's refusal could be seen as not supporting her emotional needs during a tough time. \n\nOn the other hand, the partner is being honest about their beliefs and isn't comfortable participating in a religious service. They might feel they can't fake going through the motions, which is fair. But the issue is whether not going is a refusal to support her in her grief. The fact that the girlfriend is upset and crying suggests that this was important to her. \n\nThe partner does say they want to be there for her, but maybe they didn't realize how significant this request was. Even if they don't believe in the religious aspects, attending the service could be a gesture of solidarity. There might be a middle ground, like attending for a part of the service or finding another way to support her without fully participating in the religious aspects. \n\nSo, the question is whether the partner's refusal is inconsiderate. If the girlfriend felt this was important for her healing, then not going might be seen as not being supportive. However, the partner's own beliefs are valid too. It's a balance between respecting each other's perspectives. But since the girlfriend specifically asked and it led to a fight, maybe the partner should have tried to accommodate her needs more, even if it wasn't their personal preference. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
