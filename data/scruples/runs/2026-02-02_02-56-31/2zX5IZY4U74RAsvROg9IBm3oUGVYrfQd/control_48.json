I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where neither is very religious. The girlfriend's dad died recently, and she asked her partner to go to church with her on Easter. He refused because he doesn't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through a service. They ended up fighting, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship dynamics. They both aren't super religious, but her family is. She used to go with them when they wanted. Now, after her dad's death, she might be seeking comfort or a sense of tradition. Even though she says she doesn't really want to go, she might still value the tradition for emotional reasons. \n\nThe author's main points are about his lack of belief and not wanting to attend. But supporting his partner during a tough time might require some compromise. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up could be about being there for her, not necessarily about religion. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that this was important to her, even if she's not religious. Maybe the act of going together is about solidarity. The author might have dismissed her emotional needs by saying they don't need to go now. That could be seen as not taking her feelings into account.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that his beliefs shouldn't be bent. But in relationships, sometimes you have to make sacrifices. The key here is whether attending the service was about her emotional support or just tradition. If she wanted to honor her father's memory through the tradition, not going might feel like not respecting that. \n\nSo, while the author isn't wrong for not being religious, refusing to attend might have been insensitive. It's about balancing personal beliefs with supporting a partner during grief. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her emotional needs despite her asking. But maybe B if he's justified in his beliefs. Hmm.\n"
