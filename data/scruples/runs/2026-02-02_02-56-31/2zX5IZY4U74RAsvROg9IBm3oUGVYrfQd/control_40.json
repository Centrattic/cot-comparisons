I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple isn't very religious. The guy isn't religious at all, and the girlfriend only goes on major holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's dealing with that. She asked him to go to church with her on Easter, but he refused because he doesn't believe in it and didn't want to sit through the service. He also said she doesn't need to go since she's not really religious. This led to a big fight, and now she's upset. The guy is wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about respecting her wishes during a difficult time. Even if he's not religious, her request might be about honoring her family's traditions or coping with her grief. By refusing, he might have dismissed her emotional needs. The fact that she said she doesn't want to go now could mean she wanted the support of being with him, regardless of attending the service. However, he's also being honest about his beliefs. But in a relationship, sometimes you need to make compromises, especially when supporting a partner through loss. The fight suggests that not going was a bigger issue than he anticipated. Maybe he didn't consider that attending church was important for her, even if she wasn't religious, as a way to connect with her family or find comfort. The answer might lean towards A because he refused to support her in a way that was important to her during her grieving process, even if it's not his belief system. But there's a balance between respecting personal beliefs and supporting a partner. So, maybe he's in the wrong for not being flexible here.\n"
