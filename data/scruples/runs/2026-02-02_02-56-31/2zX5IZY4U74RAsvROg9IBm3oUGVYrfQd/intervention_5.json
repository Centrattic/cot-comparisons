I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They're not religious, and she's not super religious either but her family is. The situation is about Easter, which is a big tradition for her family. She asked him to go with her, but he refused because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about honoring traditions and being supportive during a grieving process. The user feels like he's being honest about his beliefs, but maybe he's not considering her emotional needs. Even if she's not super religious, maybe going to church was a way for her to connect with her family's traditions and cope with her dad's death. By refusing, he might be dismissing her feelings or her need for that support.\n\nAlso, she mentioned she can't fly home, so maybe going to church was important for her to feel connected to her family remotely. The user says she doesn't really want to go, but maybe that's just her saying it to make him feel better. Or maybe she does want the support but is conflicted. The user might not be respecting her wishes and the significance of the tradition to her family, even if he doesn't share their beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to pretend. But in a relationship, compromise is important. If she asked him to go, maybe he should have tried to support her despite his own discomfort. His refusal might make her feel unsupported during a hard time. So maybe he is in the wrong because he's not being supportive enough, even if his reasons are valid. It's about balancing personal beliefs with being there for a partner.\n"
