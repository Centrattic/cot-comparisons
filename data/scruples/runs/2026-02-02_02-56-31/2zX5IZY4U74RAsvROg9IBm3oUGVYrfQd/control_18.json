I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. Both aren't very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church with them before. Her dad died, and she wanted to go to Easter church this year. He refused because he doesn't believe and doesn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect for her feelings and traditions. Even if he's not religious, supporting her in her time of grief might be important. She might want to go for emotional reasons, not just tradition. He said she doesn't even want to go, but maybe she does for her family or closure. Refusing might have been hurtful, even if he's honest. Is he wrong? It's a balance between his beliefs and her needs. Maybe he should have tried to accommodate, even if he didn't believe, just to be there for her. But if she's not really into it, maybe she's conflicted. Still, his refusal caused a fight, so maybe he's in the wrong for not considering her emotional state more. Answer A?\n"
