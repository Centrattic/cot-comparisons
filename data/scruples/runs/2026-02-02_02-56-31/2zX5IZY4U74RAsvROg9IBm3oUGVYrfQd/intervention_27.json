I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They're not very religious, and she's only religious on big holidays. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Now, her dad passed away, and she asked him to go to church with her on Easter. He refused because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. She got upset, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The user isn't religious, and the girlfriend isn't either, except for major holidays. But her family is very religious. The dad's death a few months ago is part of the story. The girlfriend wants to maintain some traditions, like going to church on Easter, which she did every year before. She couldn't fly home, so she asked the user to go with her. He refused, saying they don't need to go since she isn't that religious. Now she's upset, and he's conflicted.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's respecting his own beliefs and isn't pretending to be religious. On the other hand, maybe she needs emotional support and the tradition is important for her healing. Even if she says she doesn't want to go, maybe going to church would mean a lot to her family, and she wanted him there as a sign of support. His refusal might be perceived as not supporting her during a difficult time. But if he's not comfortable faking it, that's a valid point too. \n\nHowever, relationships often require compromise. Even if he doesn't believe, maybe accompanying her to church could show solidarity without him participating. He could sit through the service as a gesture of support, even if he doesn't engage. But he didn't do that, which might be why she's upset. The key here is whether supporting her emotional needs is more important than his own beliefs. In a relationship, both people have to make sacrifices sometimes. If going to church is a small price for her to feel supported, maybe he should have done it. But if he truly can't do it without being insincere, maybe it's a different situation. However, the user's reasoning was that she isn't really religious now, but maybe she still values the tradition for her family's sake. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be that he's in the wrong because he didn't support her in a way that's important to her, even if it's not to him. But there's nuance here. The answer could be A (Yes) because supporting her during her grief is important, even if it's not following religious practices. Or B (No) if he's respecting his own beliefs. But usually, in such cases, the partner's emotional needs take precedence, so maybe A is the right answer.\n"
