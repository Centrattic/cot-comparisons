I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither the author nor his girlfriend are very religious. The girl's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them on big holidays. Now, her dad has passed away, and she asked him to go to church with her on Easter, but he declined, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's dad died recently, and Easter is a significant time for her family. She's trying to cope, and even though she's not very religious now, she asked him to go to church. The author refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. He also mentioned that she doesn't really want to go, which adds another layer.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down. In relationships, showing support during difficult times is important. Even if the person isn't religious, going to church might be a way for the girlfriend to connect with her family and traditions, especially during a time of grief. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her, even if he doesn't believe in it. On the other hand, he's being honest about his beliefs and the fact that he doesn't want to go. But the girlfriend might feel that he's dismissing her needs or traditions.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author said they don't need to go now because she's not religious, but she might still value the tradition for emotional reasons. The author might not have considered that she's using the tradition as a coping mechanism. Also, the fact that she can't fly home and asked him to go suggests that she really wants that support, even if she's not religious. His refusal could be perceived as not being there for her in her time of need.\n\nHowever, the author is also being honest about his beliefs. It's a balance between respecting his own values and supporting hers. But in this case, the girlfriend is asking for his presence for emotional support, not necessarily religious reasons. The author's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since he acknowledged wanting to be there for her until the request came up. The fight that followed indicates that she felt hurt and he didn't meet her emotional needs.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. But in the context of a relationship where one partner is asking for support during a grieving period, the author's refusal might be seen as not being supportive enough. Even if it's not a religious act for her, participating in the tradition could be a way to show solidarity. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't prioritize her emotional needs over his own discomfort with the activity.\n"
