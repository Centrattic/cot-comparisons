I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, the context: Neither the author nor his girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church with them on big holidays. Her dad died recently, and she asked him to go to Easter church with her this year because she couldn't fly home. He refused because he doesn't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight about it, and she's upset now.\n\nSo, the key points here are about respecting her needs during a grieving time. Even if they aren't religious, maybe she finds comfort in traditions. The author says she even told him she doesn't really want to go, but she might have still wanted him to accompany her for support. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they aren't religious, they don't need to go. But when someone is grieving, they might need emotional support from their partner, even if it's in a religious setting. So, the question is whether the author was wrong to refuse, considering her emotional state and her family's traditions.\n\nI think it's about empathy here. The author might not see the value in the tradition, but his girlfriend might need that support. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up could be a way to say he's there for her. Refusing might make her feel unsupported, which could be why she's upset. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is honest about his beliefs and doesn't want to pretend. However, in relationships, sometimes you have to make compromises for each other, especially during tough times. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not bending a bit here, even if it's not a religious act for him, just to support her emotionally.\n"
