I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They both aren't very religious. The girlfriend sometimes goes on big holidays, and her family is religious. Her dad passed away, and she wanted to go to Easter church this year because it's a tradition. The user refused because they don't believe and don't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight.\n\nHmm. The key points are about respecting her feelings and traditions. Even if they aren't religious, maybe the church service is important for her emotionally, especially after her dad's death. She mentioned she doesn't really want to go, but maybe she thought going with him would help her cope or honor her dad's memory. The user's refusal might have made her feel unsupported, even if she's not religious herself. So maybe the user is in the wrong because they didn't consider her emotional needs beyond the religious aspect. It's about empathy and support in a relationship. Answer A.\n"
