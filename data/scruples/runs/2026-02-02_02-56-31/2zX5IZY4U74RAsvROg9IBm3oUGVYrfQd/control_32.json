I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't go to church with their girlfriend after her dad died is wrong. The situation is a bit complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, both the person and their girlfriend aren't very religious. The girlfriend goes to church on big holidays like Christmas and Easter, but the person isn't religious at all. Her family is more religious, and she used to go with them. Now her dad has passed away, and she's trying to cope. She asked him to go to church with her on Easter, but he refused because he didn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. She got upset, and they fought about traditions. The person feels bad but thinks since she's not really religious now, church isn't necessary.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about respect, support, and understanding. The girlfriend might be using the church as a way to honor her dad's memory or find comfort, even if she's not super religious now. The person might not realize how important this tradition is to her, especially after her loss. Even if they aren't religious themselves, showing up could be a way to support her emotionally. By refusing, he's not respecting her need for that support, which might be why she's upset. \n\nBut then again, the person isn't religious and might have valid reasons for not wanting to go. However, in a relationship, sometimes you have to make compromises for your partner's emotional well-being. If she's crying and sulking, it shows the rejection hurt her feelings. The author might be wrong because he didn't consider her emotional needs in this situation, even if he's honest about his beliefs. It's about balancing personal beliefs with supporting a partner during a tough time.\n"
