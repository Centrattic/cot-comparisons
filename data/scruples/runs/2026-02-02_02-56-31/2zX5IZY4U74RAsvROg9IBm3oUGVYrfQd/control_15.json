I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that both aren't very religious, but her family is. She wanted to go to Easter church this year because it's a tradition, but the author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. Now they're fighting, and the author is questioning if he's wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's family is very religious, and she went with them in the past. Her dad died recently, so maybe this is part of her mourning process. She might be seeking comfort through tradition. The author says he's not religious and doesn't believe in it, so he refused. But even though she says she doesn't want to go, she still asked him to go. Maybe she's conflicted or trying to honor her family's wishes.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't need to go now since she's not very religious. But maybe the fact that her family is religious and she has a history of going makes it significant for her. Even if she's not super religious now, the tradition might hold emotional weight, especially after a loss. \n\nBut then again, the author is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to sit through the service. It's important in a relationship to be authentic. However, supporting a partner during a tough time is also important. Even if he's not religious, showing up for her could be seen as a gesture of support, regardless of the activity. \n\nSo, is he wrong? The question is about whether his refusal is in the wrong. On one hand, he's being honest and not compromising his beliefs. On the other, maybe he should have made an exception for her emotional needs. The fact that she was crying and sulking suggests that his refusal hurt her feelings. Even if they aren't religious, maybe the act of accompanying her was more about being there for her than the religion itself. \n\nAlso, she mentioned she doesn't really want to go, but still asked him to go. Maybe she's conflicted about the tradition versus her current feelings. The author might not have considered that she might need his presence more than the actual church service. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't prioritize her emotional needs in this situation, even if he's not religious. Or maybe he's not because he's being honest and they aren't religious. It's a bit of a gray area. But given that she's going through a tough time and he's her partner, supporting her through traditions she feels are important might be expected, even if they aren't personally meaningful to him. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
