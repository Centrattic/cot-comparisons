I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither he nor his girlfriend are very religious, but her family is. She wanted to go to church on Easter, which she did every year with her family, but he refused because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. They fought about it, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says he's trying to be supportive, but this specific request made her cry. The key points are their lack of religiousness versus her family's traditions. She's not super religious, but there's a tradition here. The author is being honest about his beliefs and preferences, but maybe he didn't consider how important this was to her family or her personally, even if she's not religious. \n\nHe argues that since she's not really religious and they both aren't, going isn't necessary. But maybe she wanted to honor her dad's memory through the tradition. The problem might be communication. He said we don't need to go now, which could come off as dismissive. Even if he doesn't believe in it, showing up might be a gesture of support for her, not necessarily about the religion itself. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not forcing her; he's expressing his own beliefs. But in a relationship, sometimes you have to make compromises, especially when it's about your partner's family and their traditions. The fact that it turned into a fight suggests that he didn't validate her feelings enough. Maybe he should have gone along, even if he didn't participate, just to show solidarity. \n\nSo, is he wrong? If the issue is about respecting her feelings and family traditions, then maybe yes. Even if he's not religious, supporting her emotionally might require some gestures, even if they're not his personal beliefs. But if he's completely unwilling to make any effort, that could be seen as selfish. The answer might depend on whether the refusal was considered a lack of support. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she wanted to do this, even if she's not religious. The author's refusal might have been a mistake in not acknowledging the emotional significance of the tradition for her, even if it's not religious for them. So, he might be in the wrong for not compromising.\n"
