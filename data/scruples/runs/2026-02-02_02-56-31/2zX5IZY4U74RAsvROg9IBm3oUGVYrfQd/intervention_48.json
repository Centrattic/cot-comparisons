I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They're not religious, and she's only somewhat religious, going for major holidays. Her family is very religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad passed away, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, which is a tradition. The user said no because they don't want to sit through the service and don't believe in it. She got upset, even though she said she doesn't really want to go either.\n\nHmm. The user feels bad but doesn't see the point in going. The girlfriend is upset about traditions. So, is the user wrong? Well, supporting someone's emotional needs is important. Even if she's not religious, the tradition might be important for her to process grief. By not going, the user might be dismissing her need for that support. But the user is also honest about their beliefs. However, in relationships, compromise is key. Maybe the user could have gone along as a gesture of support, even if they don't personally believe in it. The fact that she was upset and it turned into a fight suggests that the user not going hurt her feelings, which is a valid point. So maybe the user is in the wrong for not being supportive of her needs, even if they don't share her beliefs. Answer A.\n"
