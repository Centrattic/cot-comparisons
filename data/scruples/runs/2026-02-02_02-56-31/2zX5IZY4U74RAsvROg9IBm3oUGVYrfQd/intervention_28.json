I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They're not religious, and neither is she really, but her family is. She wanted to go to church on Easter because it's a tradition, but he refused because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight, and she's upset.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about supporting a partner during a grieving time. Even if you don't share the same beliefs, sometimes showing up for them is important. The girlfriend might need the tradition as a part of her coping mechanism. The user's argument is that they don't believe in it and don't want to go, but maybe they're underestimating how important it is to her, even if she says she doesn't really want to go. Sometimes people say they don't want something but still need it for emotional reasons.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned that she can't fly home for Easter, so going to church with her might be the only way she can participate in the tradition. If he refuses, it might make her feel unsupported. Even if he's not religious, respecting her needs and traditions, especially during a difficult time, could be more important. But then again, the user isn't comfortable pretending to believe in something they don't. But maybe they don't have to believe in it\u2014they just have to show up to support her.\n\nThe user says she even said she doesn't really want to go, but maybe that's her way of expressing frustration or sadness, not the actual reason she wanted him there. If he had gone, maybe he could have given her the emotional support she needed without necessarily participating in the religious aspects. The fight that ensued suggests that his refusal hurt her feelings, which could mean he should have tried to accommodate her request, even if it wasn't his preference. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's not willing to participate at all, maybe he's justified in not going. But the fact that she's grieving and he's not showing up for the tradition she values might be seen as not being supportive. It's a balance between respecting personal beliefs and supporting a partner's emotional needs. I think the consensus here is that even if he doesn't believe, showing up as a supportive partner is important. So maybe the answer is that he is in the wrong because he didn't support her in her time of need, even if it wasn't his tradition. So Answer A.\n"
