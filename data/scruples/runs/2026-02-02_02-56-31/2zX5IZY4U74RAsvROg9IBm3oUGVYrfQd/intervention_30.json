I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They both aren't very religious, but her family is. She used to go with them before. Now, after her dad's death, she asked him to go to Easter church with her. He refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight over it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about respecting her feelings and her family's traditions, even if they aren't religious. The user's argument is that she isn't that religious now and they both don't care much for it. But the girlfriend's perspective is that it's a tradition she's trying to maintain, maybe as a way to cope with her dad's death. \n\nEven if the user isn't religious, showing support in her time of grief might be important. She might need the comfort of tradition, even if she's not super religious. The user might have thought they were being honest about their beliefs, but maybe they didn't consider how important this was to her emotionally. \n\nAlso, the fact that she asked him to go with her suggests she wanted his support. Refusing might feel like not being supportive, even if he doesn't believe in it. Maybe there's a compromise, like attending part of the service or finding another way to support her without going to church. \n\nBut the user's stance is that they don't need to go since she's not really into it. However, the timing after her dad's death might make this different. She might need the emotional support from that tradition. So, even if they don't share the beliefs, respecting her need to do this for herself could be important. \n\nI think the user is in the wrong here because they didn't support her in a time of grief, even if it's not their personal belief. It's about empathy and understanding her emotional needs, not just sticking to their own lack of belief.\n"
