I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died.\n\nFirst, the context: Neither the author nor his girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them but isn't super religious herself now. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's trying to cope. She asked him to go to Easter church with her, but he refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to attend. She's upset, leading to a fight about traditions.\n\nSo, the main points here are about respecting her feelings and traditions during a time of grief. Even if they aren't religious, attending church might be a significant emotional support for her during this time. The author argues that she doesn't really want to go, but she did ask him to go, which suggests it's important to her. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend says she doesn't really want to go either. That's a bit confusing. If she's not really wanting to go, why did she ask him? Maybe she felt pressured by her family or felt it was a tradition she should honor even if she's not into it. The author's refusal might be dismissing her emotional needs, even if the act itself isn't meaningful to him. \n\nRespecting someone's wishes, especially during a difficult time, is important in a relationship. Even if the act is just about tradition, for her, it might be a way to connect with her family or honor her dad. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her through her grief, which is a big deal. \n\nHowever, the author isn't religious and doesn't want to pretend or attend. But maybe he could have compromised in a different way, like attending just for her, even if he didn't participate. Relationships often require flexibility. The fact that she's upset and crying shows that this is a sensitive issue for her. \n\nSo, balancing his beliefs with her emotional needs is key. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider how important this gesture was to her, even if he didn't personally believe in it. Support in relationships isn't always about agreeing but about showing up for each other.\n"
