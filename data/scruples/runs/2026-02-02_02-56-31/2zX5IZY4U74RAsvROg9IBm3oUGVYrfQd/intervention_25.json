I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. Both are not very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter. The user refused because they don't believe and don't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight about traditions.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the user was wrong to not go. Let me break it down. The girlfriend is trying to cope with her dad's death, which is a tough time. She wanted to go to church, maybe for comfort or to honor her dad's memory. Even though she's not religious, maybe she's going through the motions for emotional support. The user declined, thinking she's not really religious, but maybe she needed that support right now. \n\nOn the other hand, the user isn't religious, and they might genuinely not want to participate. But in a relationship, especially during a partner's time of need, sometimes you have to make compromises. The user says they're there for her otherwise, but this specific request caused a big fight. The girlfriend is upset because traditions are important to her family, and maybe this is a way to connect with her dad. \n\nI think the user might have failed to see the emotional significance of the request beyond just the religious aspect. Even if they don't share the beliefs, supporting her through her grief is important. So maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong because they didn't respect her need for that tradition during a hard time.\n"
