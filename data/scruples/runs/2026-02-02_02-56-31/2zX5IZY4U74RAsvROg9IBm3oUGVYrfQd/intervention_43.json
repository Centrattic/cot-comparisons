I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They both aren't very religious, but her family is. She asked him to go to Easter church, which she did every year with her family before. He declined because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. They had a fight about it, and she's upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and respect. The user's girlfriend might be using the church as a way to cope with her dad's death, even if she's not super religious. Maybe she wanted the support, even if she said she doesn't really want to go. The user might not have considered that her request was more about emotional support than the religious aspect. Also, traditions can be important for some people, especially during tough times. Even if they're not religious, going to church might be a way to honor her dad or her family's wishes.\n\nBut the user also mentioned that the girlfriend said she doesn't really want to go. That complicates things. If she's not even wanting to go, but asked him to go anyway, maybe there's another layer here. Maybe she wanted him to be there for her, to show solidarity, regardless of his own beliefs. The fact that they had a big fight suggests that the issue isn't just about the church but maybe deeper issues about respecting each other's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to participate in something he doesn't believe in. That's valid too. But maybe the problem is that he didn't offer an alternative. Like, maybe he could have gone to show support, even if he didn't engage in the service, or found another way to be there for her. \n\nSo it's a balance between respecting his own beliefs and her emotional needs. The user might be in the wrong because he didn't consider that she might need the emotional support from the tradition, even if she's not religious. Alternatively, she might be overreacting if she didn't really want to go. But since she's upset and it's a big fight, it's possible that the user should have made an effort to meet her halfway, even if it wasn't his thing. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong, because supporting her through her grief might require some compromise, even if it's not a personal belief.\n"
