I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that they both aren't very religious, but her family is. The girlfriend asked him to go to church on Easter, which was part of her tradition with her family. He refused because he doesn't believe in it and didn't want to sit through the service. Now they're fighting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is dealing with her dad's death, which is a tough time. She might have wanted the support of her partner, even if it's in a religious setting. But he's not religious at all. The main issue here is about respecting each other's needs and traditions during a difficult period.\n\nHe argues he's not being supportive by not attending, but she might see going to church as a way to honor her father and find comfort. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up could be a gesture of support. On the flip side, forcing himself to sit through a service he doesn't believe in might make him uncomfortable, which could affect his ability to support her. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. Did they talk about his feelings beforehand? If he's never been religious and she's aware, maybe she expected him to make an exception for her. But maybe he didn't express his discomfort clearly. \n\nThe fight turned into a big argument about traditions. It's possible that she feels her traditions and her need for comfort are being dismissed. Even if she says she doesn't want to go, maybe going was important for her emotionally. He might not realize the significance of that tradition in her grieving process.\n\nSo, the crux is whether respecting her emotional needs during grief outweighs his personal beliefs. It's a balance between respecting each other's values and being supportive. In relationships, sometimes you have to compromise, especially during tough times. If supporting her meant attending a church service, even if it's not his belief, maybe it's a small sacrifice for her. However, if he's honest about his discomfort and they can find another way to support her, that's different. But since he refused without offering an alternative, it might have made her feel unsupported.\n\nIn conclusion, while he's not wrong for not being religious, not attending church might have hurt her feelings because she wanted his support in her own way. So, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because of how it affected her and the lack of compromise.\n"
