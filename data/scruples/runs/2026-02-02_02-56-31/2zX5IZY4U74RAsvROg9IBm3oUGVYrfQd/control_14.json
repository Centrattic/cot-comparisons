I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should have gone to church with their girlfriend after her dad died.\n\nFirst, the author isn't very religious and their girlfriend only goes occasionally, like on big holidays. But her family is very religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's trying to cope. She asked the author to go to church with her on Easter, but he refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. He says she isn't that religious now, but she ended up being upset, leading to a big fight about traditions. The author is questioning if they did the wrong thing.\n\nHmm, so the key points are about supporting a partner during a tough time and respecting her family's traditions. Even if the author isn't religious, the girlfriend might see going to church as an important part of her grieving process or family tradition. The author's refusal might come off as not supporting her, even if he thinks she's not religious. But he did say he's there for her otherwise. However, when she asked for something specific that's meaningful to her, not complying might hurt her feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend mentioned she can't fly home and asked him to go with her. Maybe she wanted the support from him, even if she's not super religious now. The author's reasoning about her not wanting to go might not matter if she actually does want to go for emotional support. The fight about traditions suggests that traditions are important to her family, and not participating might seem dismissive of their values. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in a religious situation and has his own beliefs. It's about personal boundaries. But in a relationship, sometimes you need to compromise for your partner's needs, especially during a time of loss. The author might not realize the emotional significance of the request beyond just the church itself. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because not going could be seen as not supporting his girlfriend during her time of need, even if he doesn't share her beliefs. However, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend felt hurt and it caused a fight, then maybe the author should have found a way to support her, even if it wasn't going to church. Compromise is important in relationships. Maybe attending part of the service or finding another way to show support. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
