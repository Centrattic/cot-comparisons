I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They're not very religious, and she's only occasionally religious but her family is very religious. She asked him to go to church on Easter, which was a tradition for her family. He said no because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are his lack of religious belief and his refusal to participate in a tradition that's important to her family. He says she's not that religious anymore, but the request was about a tradition. Even if she's not super religious, the act of going to church might be about supporting her family's needs during a grieving time. \n\nHe mentions she said she doesn't really want to go. So maybe she's conflicted. But she still asked him to go with her. His refusal might be seen as not supporting her during a difficult time. Even if he's not religious, showing up might be a gesture of solidarity. \n\nBut wait, he does say he's there for her otherwise. The issue is about this specific request. The problem is that traditions can be important in times of loss. Even if he doesn't believe, attending could be a way to show respect for her family's wishes and her feelings. \n\nHe's not wrong for his beliefs, but maybe in the way he handled it. Maybe he could have communicated better, like explaining his discomfort but also trying to find another way to support her. Or perhaps he could have gone, even if not believing, to support her. \n\nBut he's not religious at all. So maybe the answer depends on whether actions that consider the partner's family's traditions are expected in relationships. Since she made the request, and he refused without compromise, he might be in the wrong. Even if he's not religious, supporting her through her grief in the way she needs could be more important. So maybe answer A, he's in the wrong.\n"
