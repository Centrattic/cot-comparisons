I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend's father died. The girlfriend is trying to cope, and they both aren't very religious. The author isn't religious at all, and the girlfriend goes to church occasionally, like Christmas and Easter. Her family is very religious. Now, the girlfriend asked the author to go to church with her on Easter, which she did every year with her family. The author refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. He also said they don't need to go since she's not that religious. This led to a big fight, and the girlfriend is upset. The author feels bad but doesn't see the point of going.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not going. Let's consider the factors. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she's dealing with grief. The author is supposed to be supportive. Even if they aren't religious, the girlfriend might see the church as a way to honor her father's memory or find comfort. The author not going could be seen as not supporting her in her time of need, even if he doesn't share her beliefs. On the other hand, the author is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to participate. But the key here is that the girlfriend was trying to connect with her family's traditions, which might be important to her healing process. The author's refusal might come off as dismissing her needs or traditions, even if he thinks she's not that religious. It's possible that the act of showing up, regardless of personal belief, is a gesture of support. The fight might have been about more than just religion\u2014it could be about the author not being there for her when she needed him. So, even if he's not religious, his refusal could be seen as not respecting her wishes and her family's traditions during a difficult time. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the emotional significance for his girlfriend.\n"
