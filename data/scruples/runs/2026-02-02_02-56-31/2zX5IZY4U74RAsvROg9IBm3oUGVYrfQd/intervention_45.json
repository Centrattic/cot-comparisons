I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad's death. Both of them aren't very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them, but now she's not super into it. She asked him to go with her on Easter because it's a tradition, but he refused because he doesn't believe and didn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is trying to honor her family's tradition, maybe as a way to cope with her dad's death. Even though she's not religious, the tradition might hold sentimental value for her. The user's refusal might come off as dismissive of her feelings, even if he doesn't share the beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to fake participation. But maybe the girlfriend needed support in a different way, and the church was a way for her to feel connected to her dad or family. The fact that she was crying and it turned into a big fight suggests that his refusal hurt her more than he anticipated.\n\nHe said she even mentioned she doesn't really want to go. So why did she ask him to go with her? Maybe she wanted the support of having him there, even if she wasn't excited about the church. His response that they don't need to go now because she's not religious might have invalidated her feelings. \n\nI think the key points are about respect for her feelings and traditions, even if he doesn't share them. Relationships often require compromise and showing up for each other's important things. Even if the church isn't meaningful to him, accompanying her could be a gesture of solidarity. Refusing might be seen as not supporting her during a hard time. So, maybe he is in the wrong here for not considering her emotional needs over his own discomfort.\n"
