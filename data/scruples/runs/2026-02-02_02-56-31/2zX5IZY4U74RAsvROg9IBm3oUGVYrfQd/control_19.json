I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author isn't religious, their girlfriend is only somewhat religious, attending mostly for big holidays. Her family is very religious, and she used to go with them. Now, after her dad's death, she asked the author to go to church with her on Easter. He refused because he doesn't believe and doesn't want to attend. They fought, and she's upset. The author is questioning if they're wrong for not going.\n\nThe main factors here are the girlfriend's emotional state and the significance of the tradition. Her dad just died, so this might be a time when she needs support. Even though she isn't super religious, the tradition of going to church with her family could be meaningful to her, especially during a time of grief. The author's refusal might have been seen as not supporting her through a hard time, even if he doesn't personally believe in the religion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing himself to attend, he's honest about his beliefs, and mentions that she also said she doesn't really want to go. That could imply she's conflicted, maybe trying to hold onto a tradition for her family's sake. But if she's crying and sulking, the author might not have considered how important this was to her, regardless of his own beliefs. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because supporting a partner during grief is important. Even if the act itself isn't meaningful to him, showing up could have been a gesture of support. The author's refusal might come off as dismissive of her emotional needs. However, there's a balance between respecting each other's beliefs and providing support. The answer might hinge on whether the author's stance was rigid or if he could have found a compromise, like going to show support without participating in the service. Since he didn't go at all, maybe that's the issue. But the girlfriend also said she didn't really want to go, which complicates things. Wait, if she doesn't want to go, why is she asking him to go? Maybe she's conflicted, wanting to honor her family's tradition even if she's not into it, and the author's refusal adds to her stress. \n\nIn such cases, partners often make sacrifices for each other's emotional well-being. So even if the author isn't religious, attending church once for her could be a way to support her. The author's reasoning that they don't need to go because she's not religious might not consider the emotional value she places on the tradition. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not accommodating her needs during a difficult time.\n"
