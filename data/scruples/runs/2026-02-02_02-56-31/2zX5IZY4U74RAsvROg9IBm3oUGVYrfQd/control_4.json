I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the text is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad's death. \n\nFirst, the context: both the author and the girlfriend aren't very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's been dealing with that. She asked the author to go to Easter church with her, but he refused. Now there's a fight about traditions and beliefs.\n\nSo, the main points here are about respect, support, and compromise in a relationship. The author is saying they don't need to go because they don't believe in it and don't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend might see going to church as important for her emotional support, especially after her father's death. She might also be trying to honor her family's traditions, even if she's not super religious now.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's being honest about his beliefs and that the girlfriend isn't super religious either. But relationships often require compromise, especially when it comes to supporting each other through tough times. Even if the author doesn't believe in the religion, showing up for her could be a way to show support and respect for her traditions. \n\nThe girlfriend mentioned she doesn't really want to go either, but maybe she asked him to go because she thought it would help her cope, or maybe she wanted to honor her father. The author not going might make her feel unsupported, even if she's not religious. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing her to go, nor is he being disrespectful. He's being honest about his beliefs. But the key here is that he's her partner, and sometimes in such situations, doing something for each other's emotional well-being is more important than sticking to personal beliefs. \n\nSo, is he wrong? It's a bit of a gray area, but in terms of relationship dynamics, refusing to participate in something that's important to her, even if it's not important to him, might be seen as not fully supporting her. The fact that it turned into a fight suggests that his refusal was hurtful, even if his intentions were to be truthful.\n"
