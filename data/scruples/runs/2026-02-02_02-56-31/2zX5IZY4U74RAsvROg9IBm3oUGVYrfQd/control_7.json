I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither he nor his girlfriend are very religious. She goes occasionally for big holidays, but her family is religious. Her dad died a few months ago, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, which is a tradition. The author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they aren't religious. His girlfriend went to church with her family in the past, but now she's not that religious. She asked him to go with her, maybe to honor the tradition or support her during a tough time. He refused, saying they don't need to go. The question is whether he's wrong.\n\nWell, he did say he wants to support her but then refused. Maybe she wanted him there for emotional support, not necessarily for the religion. He might not have considered that. Even if she isn't religious, going to church might be a way for her to connect with her family's traditions or find comfort. By not going, he might have dismissed her needs. Also, he said she doesn't really want to go, but maybe she does want the support from him. The fact that it turned into a fight suggests that this is important to her even if she's not religious.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not religious and doesn't want to pretend. But in relationships, sometimes you have to compromise, especially when it's about supporting your partner's emotional needs. The dad died recently, so she's dealing with grief. Maybe attending the service together, even if he's not religious, would show solidarity. His refusal might come off as not caring about her traditions or her emotional state.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't meet her emotional needs, even if the act itself isn't religious for her. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong. But wait, maybe there's another angle. What if attending church is not something he can do, even if he wanted to? But the issue is that he refused without understanding her deeper needs. The key is that she might need the support, even if she's not religious. So the answer is A.\n"
