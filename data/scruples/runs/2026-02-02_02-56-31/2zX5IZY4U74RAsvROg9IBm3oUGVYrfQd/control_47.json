I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They aren't religious, she goes occasionally, but her family is religious. She wanted to go to church on Easter, which was a tradition, but he refused. They had a fight.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about respecting a partner's wishes and traditions, especially during a time of grief. The man says he's there for her but refused to go to church. His reasons are that he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. The girlfriend was upset, even though she mentioned she doesn't really want to go either. That's a bit confusing. If she doesn't want to go, why is she upset he didn't go with her? Maybe she wanted him to support her by being present, even if she wasn't fully committed to the tradition.\n\nBut wait, she did say she doesn't really want to go. So why does she care if he goes? Maybe she wanted the support from him, even if the tradition isn't her thing. Or maybe she's conflicted because her family expects it, and she's trying to navigate her own feelings. The man might be missing the point by not recognizing that she might need emotional support, not necessarily a shared belief in the tradition.\n\nOn the other hand, the man isn't religious and isn't comfortable faking it. It's important to be honest about one's beliefs. But in a relationship, sometimes you compromise. The question is whether refusing to attend church in this specific case is being in the wrong. Since her dad just died, maybe church is important for her family to provide comfort. If she's part of that support system, attending might be a way to show solidarity with her family and her, even if he personally isn't into it.\n\nBut she also said she doesn't really want to go. So maybe she's conflicted between her family's expectations and her own feelings. The man's refusal could be seen as not being supportive. Even if he doesn't believe in religion, showing up to support her during a difficult time is important. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests that his refusal hurt her feelings. If he truly wants to be there for her, attending church might be a small price to pay for her emotional well-being, especially if she's in a vulnerable state.\n\nBut then again, he's not religious and might feel pressured to pretend. That's a valid concern too. There's a balance between compromise and staying true to oneself. However, in times of grief, sometimes partners need each other's presence more than usual. If the request was about emotional support rather than religious belief, then going might not be about faith but about being there for her. The answer could depend on whether the primary issue was the act of attending church or his refusal to support her during her grief.\n\nSo, is he wrong? If the main issue is not attending a religious service, and he's honest about his beliefs, maybe not. But if she needed emotional support and he didn't provide it by refusing to go, then he might be wrong. The girlfriend's mixed signals complicate things. She says she doesn't want to go, but she's upset. Maybe she wanted him to go with her to show support, regardless of her own desire. In that case, he could be in the wrong for not prioritizing her emotional needs over his comfort.\n"
