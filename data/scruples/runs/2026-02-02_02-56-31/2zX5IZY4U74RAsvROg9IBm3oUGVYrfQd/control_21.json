I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author isn't religious, their girlfriend isn't either but her family is. They both aren't very religious, but she went to church sometimes, especially on big holidays. The dad died, and she's trying to cope. On Easter, which was a tradition for her family, she asked him to go with her. He declined because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. She got upset, thinking it's about traditions, even though they both aren't religious. Now he's questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The girl's emotional state after her dad's death. 2) The tradition and her family's expectations. 3) The author's refusal based on personal beliefs. 4) The conflict that arose.\n\nI need to consider if the author's refusal was inconsiderate. While the author isn't religious, supporting his girlfriend during her time of grief might require some compromise. Even if she's not super religious, the tradition might be important to her as a way to cope. By not attending, he might be dismissing her emotional needs. However, forcing himself to go against his beliefs might not be the right approach either. The question is whether his refusal was inconsiderate without considering her feelings beyond his own beliefs.\n\nAlso, she mentioned she doesn't really want to go but was still upset. That's conflicting. Maybe she wanted the support of her partner being there, regardless of the actual attendance. The author's response of \"we don't need to go now\" might have invalidated her feelings, even if she's not religious. The fight over traditions suggests that the issue isn't just about the church but about her needing him to show up for her in a meaningful way.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that her request was about emotional support and shared experience rather than religious obligation. Even if they don't believe, showing up could be a way to support her through her grief, especially if her family is using the tradition as a way to grieve. The author's refusal might come off as not prioritizing her emotional needs during a tough time. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), because he didn't consider her emotional needs as much as his own beliefs.\n"
