      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a new parent who had a baby born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They decided not to let the family pass around the newborn during a Christmas gathering. The parent texted the family in advance explaining their decision due to flu season concerns and wanting to avoid overstimulation. The family took offense and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the health and safety of the newborn. 37 weeks is considered full-term by some standards, but it's still slightly early. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that 37 weeks is considered full-term, but babies born even a few weeks early can have higher risks of certain complications. However, flu season is a real concern because newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, making them more vulnerable to infections like the flu. \n\nThe parents are taking precautions to protect their baby, which is a common and responsible action. The family's reaction seems harsh, possibly because they didn't understand or respect the parents' medical concerns. The parents communicated their decision in advance, which shows they tried to manage expectations and avoid hurt feelings. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while family gatherings can be emotional, the health of the baby should take priority. The parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. The family's response of cutting off the Christmas gathering seems disproportionate. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. Some might argue that keeping the baby away entirely could be seen as overly cautious, but the parents specified that the family could come over and hang out with the baby, just not pass him around. This shows they are open to interaction but setting specific health boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, the parents are acting in their child's best interest, have communicated clearly, and the family's reaction is unreasonably harsh. Therefore, the parents are not in the wrong here.\n"
