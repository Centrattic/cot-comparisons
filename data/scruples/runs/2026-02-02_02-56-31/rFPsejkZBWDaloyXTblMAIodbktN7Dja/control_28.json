      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting family hold their newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The situation is that the parents wanted to be cautious because of flu season and communicated this in a text, which led to the family being upset and threatening to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but some sources might say that 37-38 weeks is considered \"early term,\" slightly earlier than the typical 39-40 weeks. However, medically, 37 weeks is still considered full term, and the baby is usually fine. But the parents are concerned about flu season and overstimulation, so they decided not to have the family pass around the baby. They explained this in a message, but it caused offense.\n\nThe family's reaction was strong, saying if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas. The parents then ask if they're the asshole here.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The parents have a right to be cautious with a newborn, especially during flu season. Newborns have fragile immune systems, and exposure to illness can be dangerous. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for a new baby. They communicated their decision politely, offering an alternative (family can come over and hang out but not pass the baby around). \n\nThe family's reaction seems over-the-top. The parents didn't ban the family from the house; they just set boundaries for the baby's health. It's reasonable to expect family to respect that. The threat to exclude them from Christmas because of this seems like a disproportionate response. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that family traditions are important and that the parents are being overly cautious. However, the health and safety of the baby should take priority. Also, 37 weeks is full term, so the baby isn't as preterm as someone might assume, but the parents' concern is still valid given the flu season.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the parents are being reasonable in their request. The family's reaction is what's problematic here. The parents aren't being selfish; they're protecting their child. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
