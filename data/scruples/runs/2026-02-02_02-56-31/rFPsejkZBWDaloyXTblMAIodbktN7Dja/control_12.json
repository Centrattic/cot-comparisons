We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe a bit early. They wanted to protect the baby from flu season, so they decided not to let the family pass around the newborn during a Christmas gathering. The family got offended and even said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they felt. The author is questioning if they were in the wrong by setting this boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. Newborns, especially those born slightly early, can be more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real concern because their immune systems aren't fully developed. Doctors often advise limiting exposure to prevent infections. So the author's decision is medically sound.\n\nNext, the family's reaction. The author clearly communicated their reasons in advance, which is a responsible step. They offered an alternative\u2014inviting the family to come over and interact with the baby, just not passing him around. The family's response seems harsh and possibly overreacted. It's possible they didn't consider the health risks and instead took offense, maybe feeling excluded or not respected.\n\nThe key points here are communication and health precautions. The author was upfront about their decision and provided a reason. They also kept the invitation open for socializing. The family's response of cutting off holiday plans seems disproportionate. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They made a reasonable decision to protect their newborn and communicated it in advance. The family's reaction is more about their feelings of being excluded rather than a valid health concern. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
