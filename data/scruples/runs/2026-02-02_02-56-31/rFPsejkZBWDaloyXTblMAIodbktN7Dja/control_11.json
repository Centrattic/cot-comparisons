We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. The parents sent a message explaining they didn't want to pass the baby around because of overstimulation and flu season concerns. The family was upset and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe the parents are treating him as if he's not fully developed. Flu season is a real health concern, especially for newborns. The parents want to protect him, which is common, but the family took offense and made a big deal about it.\n\nThe parents' message was polite but firm. They invited the family to come over and hang out but not pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh. The parents are trying to balance their baby's health with family expectations. \n\nIs there any indication that the parents were unreasonable? 37 weeks is technically full term, but some sources might say there's a slight risk compared to 40 weeks. However, the flu season is a valid reason to be cautious. The parents aren't saying no to interaction altogether\u2014just not passing the baby. \n\nThe family's response of cutting off Christmas seems extreme. It's possible they wanted to hold the baby and felt disrespected. The parents are in a vulnerable position with a new child, so their priority is the baby's health. \n\nI think the parents are justified in their decision. They communicated their reasons clearly and offered an alternative (visiting). The family's reaction is more about their own feelings of being excluded or not being allowed to hold the baby, rather than the parents being outright wrong. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
