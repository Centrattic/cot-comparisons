We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole (AITA) for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The family took offense to the message about not passing the baby around because of flu season and overstimulation, leading to a Christmas rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term or near-term. However, some sources say that 37 weeks is 3 weeks premature, which might still have the baby needing more care. But generally, full-term is 37-40 weeks. So maybe the parents were being cautious. It's flu season, so avoiding exposure to germs is understandable. Also, overstimulation for a newborn is a valid concern. New parents might be protective, especially with a new baby.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Insisting on passing around a baby when the parents have a valid reason to prevent exposure and overstimulation could be seen as inconsiderate. The parents are setting boundaries for their child's health and well-being. The family's response of cutting off Christmas because of that seems disproportionate. The parents' message was clear and polite, explaining their reasons. They even invited the family over, which shows they wanted to spend time together but with safety measures.\n\nSo, the parents are not being unreasonable. The family's reaction might stem from misunderstanding or not respecting the parents' health decisions. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
