We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, and they wanted to be cautious during flu season. They sent a message explaining they wouldn't pass the baby around but invited everyone to come over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A 37-week baby is considered early, so there might be health concerns. Flu season adds risk, and parents might be worried about infections. They're trying to protect the baby, which is their primary responsibility. The message they sent was polite and explained their reasoning, which seems reasonable.\n\nNow, the family's reaction was to say they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. That seems harsh. The parents are making a medical decision to protect their newborn. It's common for new parents to set boundaries, especially with a preterm baby. The family's response might stem from feeling excluded or not being considered, but that doesn't justify cutting off the parents.\n\nLooking at societal norms, new parents often have specific needs, especially with a preterm baby. It's their right to set these boundaries. The key here is that the parents communicated clearly and offered an alternative (visiting the baby). The family's overreaction might be due to not understanding the medical risks or feeling slighted. However, the parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing the baby's health.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are acting in the best interest of their child, and their communication was clear and respectful. The family's response is the issue here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
