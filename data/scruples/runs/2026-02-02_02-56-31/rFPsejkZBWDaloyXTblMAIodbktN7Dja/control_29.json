You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't let their family pass around their newborn is in the wrong. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They sent a message explaining they don't want to pass the baby around because of flu season and over-stimulation. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is considered full term or near full term in some definitions, but it's still a preterm birth. The baby might be more vulnerable to infections, so flu season is a valid concern. The parents are trying to protect their child's health, which is a common reason to limit handling. \n\nThen there's the family reaction. The parents communicated their decision in advance and invited the family to visit. The family's response seems harsh. It's possible they felt excluded or thought the parents were being overly cautious. But the parents' priority is their baby's safety. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? In some cultures, not allowing family to hold a newborn might be seen as rude or distant. However, the parents did invite them to be present without handling the baby. The key is that they provided an alternative to maintain the gathering without compromising the baby's safety. \n\nThe tone of the message seems polite and explanatory. They mentioned not wanting the baby over-stimulated, which is another valid concern for a newborn, especially one born a bit early. Over-stimulation can affect the baby's ability to rest and adjust. \n\nSo, the parents made a reasonable decision with good intentions. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. The parents aren't in the wrong here. They communicated their reasons and still allowed the family to be part of the celebration. The real issue might be the family's sensitivity rather than the parents' actions. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
