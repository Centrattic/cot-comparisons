We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user had a baby born three weeks early, which is 37 weeks. They mentioned that they're not going to pass the baby around during a family gathering around Christmas because they're worried about flu season. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A 37-week baby is considered preterm, even though it's not very early. They might have some health concerns, especially in flu season. Parents might be more cautious about exposing the baby to germs. So, the parents' decision is based on protecting their child's health. That seems reasonable.\n\nBut then, the family's reaction was pretty harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because of this. It seems like the family didn't take their concerns seriously. The user's message says they're open to the family coming over to see the baby, just not passing him around. So they're allowing interaction but with caution.\n\nIs the user wrong for setting these boundaries? Probably not. They have a valid health reason. However, maybe the way they communicated it could be improved. Maybe the message came off as dismissive or not open to discussion. But the main issue is the family's overreaction. The user is trying to protect their baby, which is a parent's duty. The family's reaction seems extreme. So the answer is B, the user isn't the asshole.\n"
