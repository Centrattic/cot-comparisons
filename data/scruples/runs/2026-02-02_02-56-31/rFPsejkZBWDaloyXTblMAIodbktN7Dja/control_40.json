We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. They wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu risks during flu season. The family reacted strongly, leading to a Christmas threat.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the reasonableness of the parents' decision. A 37-week gestation is considered preterm, but some sources say it's still considered full-term if the baby is healthy. However, even if the baby is healthy, being three weeks early might make them more vulnerable to illnesses like the flu. So the parents' concern about health is valid.\n\nThen, the communication part. The text they sent was polite and explained their reasons, saying family could come over and hang out. They didn't refuse the visit, just not pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh. It's possible they felt excluded or offended, but the parents had a legitimate medical reason. \n\nThe family's response of cutting off Christmas seems extreme. Usually, family gatherings can have compromises, like limiting handling the baby. The parents are trying to protect their child's health, which is a common concern when there are young children. \n\nI think the key points are the health justification and the clear communication from the parents. The family's reaction might be overreacting, so the parents aren't in the wrong here. So the answer is B, No.\n"
