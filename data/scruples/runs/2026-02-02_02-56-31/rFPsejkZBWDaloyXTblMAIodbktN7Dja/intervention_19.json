We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. They mentioned flu season as a reason. The family got upset and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The baby is born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but maybe early enough to be still considered \"barely full term.\" The parents are trying to protect the baby from overstimulation and flu. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family over to meet the baby.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Insisting on passing around a newborn, especially during flu season, could be risky. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so avoiding exposure to germs is a common precaution. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for newborns.\n\nThe parents' message was clear and offered an alternative\u2014family can come over but not pass the baby around. The family's response of threatening to exclude them from Christmas seems disproportionate. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and well-being, which is a responsible action.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural expectation or family tradition that the parents didn't consider. But the problem is not about the tradition but the health and safety measures. The parents had a legitimate reason and communicated it respectfully. The family's reaction was hostile and exclusionary, which doesn't seem justified.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the parents are taking reasonable precautions for their newborn's health and communicated their position clearly without being rude.\n"
