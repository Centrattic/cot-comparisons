We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole in the situation where they told their family not to pass around their newborn because of the flu season and not overstimulating the baby. The family took offense and threatened to exclude them from Christmas if they don't agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. That's considered full-term, but some people might consider it borderline or a preemie. The parents wanted to keep the baby safe from flu and avoid overstimulation. Their message was polite and offered alternatives like coming over to meet the baby but not passing him around.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. They interpreted the request as a rejection, leading to the Christmas threat. The key points are the parents' intent to protect the baby versus the family's need to see the baby. The parents' message was clear and considerate, not excluding anyone but setting a boundary.\n\nPossible angles: Cultural norms around baby interactions, the sensitivity of family dynamics, the health concerns vs. family traditions. The parents are prioritizing the baby's wellbeing, which is a valid reason. The family's reaction might stem from misunderstanding or feeling slighted, but that doesn't make the parents in the wrong. \n\nAssuming the message was respectful and the reasons are genuine, the parents aren't being inconsiderate. The family's response is more about their feelings than the parents' actions. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). The parents are protecting their child, and the family's overreaction is the issue here.\n"
