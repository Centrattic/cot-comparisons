We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. They mentioned it's flu season and they wanted to keep the baby safe. The family got upset and threatened to not come to Christmas. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the baby's health. A 37-week preemie is still considered early, right? They might have some health concerns. The parents are probably worried about infections or overstimulation. Flu season is a real risk for newborns. \n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The user's message was polite, explaining their concerns. They invited everyone over but just didn't want the baby passed around. The family's response was harsh, leading to a potential Christmas fallout. \n\nIs the user at fault? They're making a decision to protect their child. New parents often have strict rules to ensure safety. The family might not understand the risks, but the parents are acting in the baby's best interest. \n\nBut maybe the way it was communicated? The text seems respectful. They provided a reason and an alternative. The family's overreaction is more concerning. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parents are doing what's necessary for their baby. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
