We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but maybe still a little early. The parents decided not to pass the baby around during a family gathering, citing concerns about the flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel. The parents are now asking if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. First, I need to recall if 37 weeks is considered full term or not. From what I know, a full term pregnancy is 40 weeks, so 37 is three weeks early. However, some sources say that 37 weeks is considered early term, and while the baby is generally okay, there can still be some increased risks compared to full term. So the parents' concern about health issues might be valid, especially during flu season.\n\nThe parents wanted to prevent the baby from getting sick or being overstimulated. They communicated their decision politely, saying the family can come over and hang out but not pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh, threatening to exclude them from Christmas if they don't comply. That's a heavy response. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' health precautions and the family's reaction. Are the parents justified in their decision? Yes, because a newborn's immune system is still developing, and even a 37-week baby might be more vulnerable. Not passing the baby is a common precaution to prevent illness. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for newborns.\n\nThe family's threat to exclude them from Christmas because of this seems like an overreaction. The parents are not being unreasonable; they're protecting their child. The way they phrased their message was polite and offered an alternative (family can come over and meet the baby without passing around). So the parents acted appropriately. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
