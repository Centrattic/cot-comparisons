We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not letting family pass around their nearly full-term newborn. The baby was born three weeks early at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe they're still cautious because of flu season. They sent a message to the family explaining they don't want to pass the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The family reacted strongly, threatening to exclude them from Christmas if they won't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is technically full term, but preemies can sometimes have more health risks, even if they're close to full term. The parents are concerned about the flu, which is a valid precaution, especially with infants. Newborns are more vulnerable to infections, so limiting exposure might be a reasonable decision. \n\nNext, the social aspect. The parents communicated their decision in a polite way, inviting the family over but setting boundaries. However, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling someone they shouldn't come to Christmas if they don't allow a baby to be passed around is extreme. Family gatherings can be stressful for new parents, especially with a new baby. Setting boundaries is important for the baby's well-being and the parents' mental health.\n\nPossible angles: The parents are acting in the baby's best interest by avoiding unnecessary handling and potential illness. The family's response is over-the-top and dismissive of the parents' concerns. Alternatively, maybe some family members felt left out or misunderstood the parents' reasoning. But from a health and safety standpoint, the parents' decision makes sense. \n\nIs there a possibility the parents could have explained better? Maybe, but they did send a message. The family's reaction is more about their own expectations or unmet needs, not the parents' actions being wrong. The key here is whether the parents had a valid reason to set the boundary. Since they did, and the family is reacting with exclusion, the parents aren't in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, they're not in the wrong). The family overreacted, and the parents have a legitimate reason to protect their newborn.\n"
