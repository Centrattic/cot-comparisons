We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The context is that they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu season risks, but their family took it as an insult, leading to a threat about not being invited to Christmas.\n\nFirst, newborn care guidelines. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, though early by a few weeks. The American Academy of Pediatrics might have recommendations on handling such situations. They usually advise against visitors, especially during flu season, for newborns under a month old or those born prematurely. So, the parents' concern about flu is valid.\n\nNext, the message they sent out. They mentioned not passing around the baby to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The tone seems polite and offers an alternative\u2014visiting but not passing the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to exclude them from Christmas because of health precautions is extreme.\n\nPossible angles: Cultural expectations vs. health priorities. In some families, holding the baby is a big deal, but if the parents are new to parenthood, they might be more cautious. The family might feel slighted if they're used to holding the baby, but the parents have a right to set boundaries for their child's health.\n\nLegal or medical perspective: There's no law against this, but health guidelines support their decision. Ethically, parents have the responsibility to protect their child's health, even if it upsets others.\n\nSocial dynamics: Families sometimes react poorly to new parents' boundaries. The parents here are being clear and respectful, yet the family is taking it personally. That's on the family's sensitivity, not the parents' fault.\n\nPossible misunderstandings: Maybe the family didn't realize the baby was only 37 weeks. But the user did mention the early birth in the context. So the family should have been informed.\n\nConclusion: The parents are acting in their child's best interest, following health advice, and communicating clearly. The family's reaction is disproportionate and unkind. The user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
