We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not allowing family to pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early (37 weeks). They wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby and reduce flu risks. The family reacted by saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's actions. At 37 weeks, a baby is considered full term, but some might still be cautious. The parents had a valid reason to limit handling to prevent illness and overstimulation. Communicating this in advance seems responsible. The family's reaction seems harsh; threatening to exclude them from Christmas for a precaution is extreme.\n\nThe key points are: flu season, newborn's health, and communication. The parents did warn everyone beforehand. The family's response is overreacting. Newborns can be fragile, even if full term. The parents have the right to protect their child. So the answer should be B, not the author's fault. They're being cautious, not inconsiderate. The family's threat is the problem, not the parents.\n"
