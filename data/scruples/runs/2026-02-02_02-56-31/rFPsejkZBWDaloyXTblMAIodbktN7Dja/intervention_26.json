We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. The family is upset and even mentioned cutting off Christmas if they stick to that decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered early term, but it's still a term baby. However, they might be more vulnerable to illnesses compared to full-term babies. Flu season is a real concern here. The parents might be doing the right thing by limiting exposure to protect the baby's health.\n\nNext, the way they communicated this. The text they sent out was polite, explaining their reasons: not wanting the baby overstimulated and flu concerns. That seems reasonable. They invited the family to come over, which shows they still wanted to celebrate together without the baby being handled by everyone.\n\nBut why did the family take it so badly? Maybe there's cultural or familial expectations about meeting a new baby. Some families might feel excluded or think the parents are being overly cautious. It's possible the family didn't anticipate such a strict policy, leading to hurt feelings. The threat about Christmas is extreme, suggesting underlying tensions or high expectations.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? They're prioritizing their baby's health, which is a valid reason. However, the family's reaction is disproportionate. The user's decision is justified, but maybe the approach could have been more inclusive or with more explanation. But given the circumstances, they have a right to set boundaries for their child's well-being.\n\nSo, the answer is B. They're not in the wrong. Health concerns are valid, and setting boundaries is okay. The family's reaction is the issue here, not the parents' decision.\n"
