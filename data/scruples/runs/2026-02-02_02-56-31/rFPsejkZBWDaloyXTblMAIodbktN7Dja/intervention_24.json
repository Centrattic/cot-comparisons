We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not letting family pass around their barely full-term newborn. The baby was born 3 weeks early at 37 weeks. The user wanted to be safe because it's flu season. They sent a message to the family explaining their decision, but the family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. A 37-week baby is considered full-term, but some sources say 37-38 weeks are \"early term.\" Even though it's technically full-term, the parents might be concerned about potential vulnerabilities. Flu season is a real risk because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until 6 months. So the parents' concern about germs and overstimulation makes sense.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. The parents are setting boundaries for their child's health and well-being. The message they sent was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's response of cutting them off Christmas for a health precaution is extreme. It's important to prioritize the baby's safety, especially since they can't control who brings what germs. The parents aren't being selfish; they're being responsible.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the parents could have been more open to compromise. Maybe the family expected to hold the baby and felt excluded. But the parents did invite them to hang out, just not to pass the baby around. That's a reasonable boundary. The family's reaction of threatening to cancel Christmas is over the top. \n\nIn conclusion, the parents are justified in their decision to protect the baby. The family's response is the issue here, not the parents. So the answer should be B (No, the user is not in the wrong).\n"
