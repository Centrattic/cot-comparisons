We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got upset and threatened to not come to Christmas. The user's message says they wanted to keep the baby safe from flu season and avoid overstimulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A 37-week pregnancy is still considered full-term, but some might argue it's borderline. However, the parents are making a conscious choice for their child's safety. Flu season is a real concern, and newborns are more vulnerable to infections. Also, overstimulation is a valid reason as newborns need rest.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might have felt excluded or not trusted to handle the baby. But the parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their child. They clearly communicated their reasons, so it's not like they were being unreasonable. The family's reaction seems extreme. Threatening to skip Christmas over this seems harsh. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health, which is a common-sense approach. The user isn't being selfish; they're being cautious. The family should respect that choice. So the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
