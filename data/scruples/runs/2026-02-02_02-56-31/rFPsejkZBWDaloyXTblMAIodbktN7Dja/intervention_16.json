We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby is at 37 weeks, which is early but not super preterm. The parents wanted to be cautious because of flu season. They sent a message explaining that they wouldn't be passing the baby around but still invited the family over. The family reacted strongly, saying if that's how they feel, don't come to Christmas.\n\nSo the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. From a medical standpoint, 37 weeks is considered full term, but there's still some risk. Flu season is a real concern, especially for a newborn. The parents are trying to protect their baby's health. The family's reaction seems harsh. They're being defensive and cutting off the parents over a precaution. The message from the parents is polite and gives a reason, so they're not being inconsiderate. The family might be feeling excluded or not respected, but the parents have a valid reason. The key points are explaining the reason, still allowing the family to be present, and the family's overreaction. So the parents aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
