We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks, during a family gathering. The family was upset and even mentioned that if they feel that way, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born three weeks early, which is still full-term in some definitions. However, 37 weeks is considered early term, and such babies might still be more vulnerable to illnesses compared to those born at 39 weeks or later. The parents are concerned about the flu season and want to limit exposure. They also mention not wanting the baby overstimulated, which is a common reason for limiting handling in early weeks.\n\nThe parents sent a message explaining their decision, which is important because they're setting boundaries. The family's reaction seems harsh, threatening to not come to Christmas if they can't hold the baby. That's a strong response. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and comfort, which is a valid concern. \n\nNow, considering the options: A says the author is in the wrong, B says not. The key here is whether the parents' decision is reasonable. Since they explained their reasons (flu season, overstimulation), they're not being inconsiderate. The family's reaction seems over the top. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
