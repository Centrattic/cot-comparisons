We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole here after not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but just barely. They mentioned flu season as a concern and wanted to avoid overstimulation. The family got offended and said not to come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, 37 weeks is considered full term, but it's still early. There might be some medical reasons to be cautious. The user's intention was to protect the baby from illness and stress. However, the family took it as a personal slight. The user's message was polite, explaining the reasons and inviting them to hang out. But the family's reaction seems harsh. \n\nIs the user wrong? They had a valid reason. The family might be used to handling babies and feel excluded. But the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health. The key here is whether the parents' decision was reasonable. Since it's their baby's health, they're not in the wrong for setting that boundary. The family overreacted. So the answer should be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
