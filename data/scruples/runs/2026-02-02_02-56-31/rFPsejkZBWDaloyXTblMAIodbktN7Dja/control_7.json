We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born 37 weeks, which is technically full term but maybe considered early by some. They mentioned flu season and didn't want the baby overstimulated. The family took offense and said not to come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if their actions were reasonable. Newborns, even 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable. Flu season is a real health concern. Parents have the right to protect their child's health. Limiting contact to prevent illness is a common precaution. People might feel hurt if they're not allowed to hold the baby, but the parents' priority is the baby's well-being. The text message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's overreaction seems unkind. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
