We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's son was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They decided not to let the family pass around the newborn during a family gathering, especially because it's flu season. The message they sent was to inform everyone in advance that they wouldn't be passing the baby around but welcomed the family to visit. The family reaction was strong, leading them to say that if they feel that way, they probably shouldn't come to Christmas. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but sometimes there can be complications. The parents might be cautious to protect the baby from illnesses, especially in flu season. The parents are trying to balance family time with the baby's health. Their reasoning is understandable because newborns have weaker immune systems, and exposure to a lot of people during flu season could be risky.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel that the parents are being overly cautious or not trusting them to handle the baby. The parents' message might have come across as a complete refusal to let them interact with the baby, which could be seen as excluding them. The family's response of cutting off Christmas contact seems extreme, but maybe they felt hurt or disrespected.\n\nThe key points here are: the parents' intention to protect the baby's health versus the family's feelings. The parents did inform everyone in advance and invited them to come over and hang out with the baby. They mentioned concerns about over-stimulation and flu. So, they're not keeping the baby away entirely but just not passing him around. \n\nI need to check if there's a cultural or social expectation here. In some families, not passing around a newborn might be seen as impolite or not sharing the joy. However, given the health concerns, especially in flu season, the parents have a valid reason. \n\nThe parents' message was clear and considerate, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. Cutting off contact over not passing a baby might be too harsh. The parents aren't refusing interaction entirely, just limiting it for health and safety. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parents are acting in the baby's best interest. They communicated their decision respectfully. The family's response is more about their own feelings rather than the parents' actual wrongdoing. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
