We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The family was offended and even mentioned not coming to Christmas. The user sent a text explaining their decision because of flu season and the baby not being overstimulated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full term, but barely. Some sources say 37-38 weeks is early term. However, the parents chose not to let people pass the baby around, citing health concerns and overstimulation. Flu season is a valid worry, especially for newborns, who can't get the flu vaccine until 6 months. So their reasoning is plausible.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas for this reason might be overreacting. The parents' message was polite and explained their stance, so the offense taken by the family might stem from misunderstanding or not respecting the parents' decision. The parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health and well-being. Newborns need time to adjust, and limiting handling can be necessary. The family's response seems disproportionate. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
