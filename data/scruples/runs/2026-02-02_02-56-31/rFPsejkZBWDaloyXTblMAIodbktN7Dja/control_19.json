We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family members hold their newborn who was born three weeks early. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but some people might argue it's \"barely full term.\" The parents wanted to protect the baby from the flu, so they declined passing him around. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical aspect. A 37-week pregnancy is considered full term, but some sources say that 37-38 weeks is early term. The baby might still be vulnerable, especially during flu season. So the parents' concern about the flu is valid. Newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months, so exposure could be risky.\n\nNext, the family's reaction. They took offense and made a threat about not attending Christmas. That's a strong reaction. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to visit, just not to pass the baby around. The family might feel excluded or not respected, but the parents are making a health decision.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, as a new parent, their primary concern is the baby's health. The flu can be severe for infants. The parents communicated their decision in advance, which is considerate. The family's threat seems harsh, possibly because they don't understand the medical risk. But the parents aren't wrong for prioritizing their child's safety. So answer B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
