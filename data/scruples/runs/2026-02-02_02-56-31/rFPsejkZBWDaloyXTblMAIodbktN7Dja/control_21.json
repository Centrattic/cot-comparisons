We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family reacted strongly, even saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe the parents are being cautious because of the flu season. They sent a message explaining that they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu, so they won't be passing the baby around. The family took offense and it led to a potential Christmas conflict.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the parents are in the wrong. From a health perspective, newborns, even if full-term, can be more vulnerable to illnesses like the flu. The flu can be serious for infants, so the parents might have a valid reason to be cautious. Also, overstimulation can affect a newborn's well-being, so limiting handling might be in the baby's best interest.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel excluded or think the parents are being overly cautious. But family dynamics can be tricky. The parents' intention was to protect the baby, not to offend. The way the message was worded seems polite and invites the family to come over and interact, just not pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh, possibly overreacting to the parents' legitimate concerns.\n\nSo, considering the health and safety of the newborn, the parents are acting responsibly. The family's response seems disproportionate. Therefore, the parents aren't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
