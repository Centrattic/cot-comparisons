We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, which was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. The family reaction was so strong that they were told not to come to Christmas if they feel that way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but the parents chose not to let the family hold the baby during a visit. The parents' reasoning is to avoid overstimulation and flu concerns. The family took offense, leading to a potential Christmas conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) the baby's health and safety, 2) the parents' right to make decisions for their child, and 3) the family's reaction. \n\nI know that 37 weeks is technically full term, but some premature babies might need extra care. However, the parents might still be cautious, especially during flu season. The parents are setting boundaries to protect their child, which is their responsibility. The family's response seems harsh, threatening to exclude the parents from a family event because they won't hold the baby. That seems excessive. Families should respect each other's medical decisions. \n\nThe parents' message was polite and clear, explaining their reasons. They offered an alternative (visiting the baby) without being restrictive. The family's reaction implies they feel slighted, but their health and safety should be the priority. \n\nSo, the parents are not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for their decision, and the family overreacted. The answer should be B.\n"
