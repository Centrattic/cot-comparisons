      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a new parent who didn't want family to pass around their baby because the baby was born three weeks early, which is 37 weeks. They mentioned flu season as a concern. The family got offended and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but maybe \"barely full term\" means the parents are cautious. Flu season is a real concern for newborns because their immune systems are weak. Passing a baby around can expose them to germs and overstimulation. \n\nThe parents sent a message explaining their decision, saying the family is welcome to visit but not to pass the baby around. The family took offense and made a dramatic statement about not coming to Christmas. \n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. From a health perspective, protecting a newborn from illness is standard practice. Doctors often advise limiting contact with newborns, especially in the first few weeks, to prevent infections. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for babies, causing stress or disrupting sleep.\n\nThe parents clearly communicated their reasons, so it's not like they were being arbitrary. The family's reaction seems exaggerated. Maybe they felt slighted or didn't take the health concerns seriously. But the parents have a valid reason. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents are protecting their baby's health and well-being, which is a legitimate concern. The family's reaction is unreasonable. The parents made their intentions clear, and the responsibility here is on the family for overreacting.\n"
