You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born 3 weeks early (at 37 weeks), and they decided not to let the family pass around the newborn during a family gathering around Christmas because they wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby and due to flu season. The family took offense and said that if they feel that way, they shouldn't come to Christmas. The author is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. 37 weeks is considered full term in some definitions, but others might consider it early. However, medical guidelines often say that 37 weeks is considered full term, but there can still be some risks associated with early delivery, even by a few weeks. The parents are concerned about the baby's health, especially with flu season being a potential risk. They communicated their decision in advance, saying people can come over and hang out but not pass the baby around.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. The parents are trying to protect their newborn, which is a common concern. The text message they sent out was polite and gave a reason. The family reacted strongly, cutting off Christmas plans entirely. The parents didn't say not to come at all, just not to pass the baby around. The family's response seems disproportionate to the request. \n\nPossible angles: Are the parents being reasonable in their request? Is the family overreacting? In most cases, people are understanding about newborn precautions, especially given health concerns. The parents are not restricting the family from attending, just how they interact with the baby. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas because of this seems extreme. \n\nMedical perspective: Even if the baby is considered full term, there's still a higher risk in the first few weeks. Flu season is a legitimate concern. The parents are making a precautionary measure. The family might not have considered the health risks, leading to offense taken where they shouldn't have.\n\nSocial norms: It's common for new parents to set boundaries, especially with a new baby. People usually respect that. The family's reaction could stem from not understanding the parents' concerns or feeling excluded, but the parents aren't keeping the baby away entirely. They just want to manage the interactions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's request is reasonable. The family's reaction is disproportionate and inconsiderate of the parents' health concerns. The author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
