      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not allowing their family to pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation involves the parents setting a boundary to protect their baby's health, especially considering flu season, but this decision caused a rift with the family, leading to a Christmas invitation being rescinded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. They mention that their son was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but not extremely preterm. However, the parents are concerned about overstimulation and the flu season. These concerns are valid because premature babies, even those born just a week or two early, can have underdeveloped immune systems and may be more susceptible to illnesses. Overstimulation can also be a concern for newborns, especially if they're not used to a lot of activity or handling.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision clearly, inviting the family to visit but specifying that they wouldn't be passing the baby around. This is a reasonable way to set boundaries. The family's reaction, however, was to withdraw the Christmas invitation, which seems harsh. The parents' actions were about protecting their child's health, which is a primary responsibility of any parent.\n\nOn the other hand, family gatherings can be important for social bonding and support, especially after a new addition. The family might have felt excluded or that their traditions were being ignored. But in this case, the parents made an exception by allowing the family to visit the baby, just not to pass him around. The family's response of cutting off holiday plans seems excessive given the parents' efforts to accommodate while maintaining necessary precautions.\n\nFrom a health perspective, the parents are making a responsible choice. They have a right to prioritize their child's safety. The family's reaction could stem from misunderstanding the parents' concerns or feeling that their traditions are being dismissed. However, the parents' request is not unreasonable. It's important to note that in similar situations, medical professionals often advise limiting exposure for preterm infants, especially during flu season.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are acting in their baby's best interest, and their communication was clear and respectful. The family's response appears to be an overreaction. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
