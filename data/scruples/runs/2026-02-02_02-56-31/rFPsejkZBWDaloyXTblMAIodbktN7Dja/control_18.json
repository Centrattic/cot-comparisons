We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family reacted by threatening to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe just barely. The parents are worried about flu season and not overstimulating the baby. Their message says they don't want to pass the baby around but are open to the family coming over to hang out. The family took offense and said if that's how they feel, don't come to Christmas.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the parents' decision is unreasonable. Newborns, even if they're full term, can be fragile. Flu season is a real concern, and limiting exposure to germs is common advice. Also, not passing a newborn around is standard practice to prevent the baby from being overstimulated or dropped. The parents are setting boundaries for their child's health and well-being.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to cancel Christmas over health precautions seems extreme. The parents aren't refusing to see the family; they're just limiting physical contact with the baby. The message was polite and explained the reasons. It's possible the family was expecting to hold the baby, maybe not realizing the parents' concerns. But the parents have the right to make decisions they see fit for their child.\n\nI think the parents are justified in their decision. They're prioritizing the baby's health, which is a valid reason. The family's threat to cancel Christmas seems like an overreaction. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
