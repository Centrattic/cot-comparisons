We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby was delivered at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and it's flu season. They sent a message explaining they don't want the baby overstimulated or exposed to the flu, so they won't be passing him around. The family was upset and even threatened not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the newborn. 37 weeks is technically full-term, but some sources say 39 weeks is considered full-term. So a baby born at 37 might still be a bit early. The parents are concerned about overstimulation and illness, which are valid reasons. Newborns, even if born early, can be more vulnerable to infections, especially in flu season.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision in advance, which is a good step. They invited the family over, just not to pass the baby. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014threatening to not come to Christmas over this. It's possible they felt excluded or that the parents are being overly cautious, but the parents are acting in the best interest of the baby.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From a health perspective, it's reasonable to avoid passing a newborn around to prevent illness. Overstimulation is also a common concern for new parents. The parents made their intentions clear, so they're not being inconsiderate without explanation. The family's reaction might be a communication issue rather than the parents' fault.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, they're not in the wrong). They're making responsible choices for their baby's health, and they communicated it respectfully.\n"
