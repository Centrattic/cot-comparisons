We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user had a baby born three weeks early, right? That's 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe early enough that some people might still be cautious. They wanted to avoid passing the baby around during Christmas to prevent overstimulation and because it's flu season. The family was upset and even threatened not to come if they don't pass the baby around. The user is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. They mentioned flu season as a reason, which is a valid health concern. Premature babies, even if born at 37 weeks, might have slightly lower immunity compared to full-term babies. Plus, overstimulation could be a real issue for a newborn. So from a health and safety perspective, their request makes sense.\n\nBut maybe the family felt excluded or hurt. The way the message was phrased might have come off as dismissive. They said \"we aren't going to be passing him around,\" which could be perceived as not respecting the family's desire to hold the baby. The family might have expected some interaction, even if just brief. The parents might not have considered the emotional impact of not allowing any contact, even if it's out of concern for the baby's health.\n\nAnother angle: cultural or family expectations. In some families, holding the newborn is a big deal, especially during holidays. The parents might not have communicated this in a way that showed they valued family traditions but also needed to set boundaries for the baby's well-being. Perhaps a more empathetic approach, explaining the medical reasons and inviting other interactions, could have helped.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents' decision was reasonable and communicated effectively. The fact that the baby was born three weeks early might be a red herring since 37 weeks is generally considered full term. However, the parents' genuine concern about the flu and wanting to avoid overstimulation is valid. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe there's more context about previous interactions or cultural norms that aren't mentioned here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are not in the wrong for prioritizing their baby's health. However, they could have handled the communication better. The family's threat to avoid Christmas seems extreme, but the parents might need to reflect on how they presented their decision. Still, the main issue is about protecting a newborn's health, which takes precedence. So the answer is B (Not the asshole), but with a note about communication.\n"
