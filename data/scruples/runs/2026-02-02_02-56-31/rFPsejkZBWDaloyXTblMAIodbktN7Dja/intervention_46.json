We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole here after refusing to let their family pass around their newborn son who was born 37 weeks early. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas. \n\nFirst, the baby was born three weeks early, which is technically a preterm birth. Even though 37 weeks is considered \"full term\" in some contexts, it's still early enough that the baby might be more vulnerable to illnesses like the flu. The parents were trying to protect their child's health, which is a valid concern, especially during flu season. \n\nThe message they sent out was polite and explained their reasons: not wanting the baby over-stimulated and worrying about the flu. They even invited the family to come over and hang out, so it wasn't a complete shutout. But the family took it as an offense, which seems a bit harsh. \n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. Well, they made a reasonable request to protect their newborn's health. New parents often set boundaries for their child's well-being. The family's reaction of cutting off Christmas contact seems excessive. The parents aren't being selfish; they're prioritizing their baby's safety. The family's response is more about their own feelings being hurt rather than the parents' actions being malicious. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parents are not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
