We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family reacted strongly, even threatening to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is just a week before the full term. So technically, it's still considered full-term, but some people might think 37 weeks is early. The parents are worried about the flu season and not overstimulating the baby. Their message was polite, explaining they don't want to pass the baby around but invite everyone to hang out. \n\nThe family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. The user is wondering if they're the asshole here. \n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, preemies or early-born babies can be more vulnerable to illnesses. Avoiding exposure to sick people and limiting stress is common advice. So the parents' reasoning is valid. The family's reaction seems extreme. \n\nHowever, family dynamics can be tricky. Maybe the family felt slighted because they expected to hold the baby. But the parents had a legitimate reason. The message was clear and polite, so the user isn't being inconsiderate. The family's response is more about their own feelings rather than the parents' decision. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the user is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason, and the family overreacted.\n"
