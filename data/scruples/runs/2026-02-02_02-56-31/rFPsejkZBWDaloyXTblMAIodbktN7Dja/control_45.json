      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing family to pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby was born three weeks early, which is considered a full term, but sometimes preterm babies can have more health risks. The parents wanted to be cautious because it's flu season, so they decided not to let the family pass the baby around. The family took offense and made a threat about not coming to Christmas. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong.\n\nSo, the parents are trying to protect their newborn from potential illnesses and overstimulation. That seems reasonable. Premature babies can have weaker immune systems, and flu season is a real concern. Overstimulation from a lot of people handling the baby might also be a valid concern for the parents' peace of mind.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel that the parents are being overly cautious or not trusting them. However, the parents clearly communicated their decision beforehand and invited the family to hang out with the baby. They didn't say not to come at all, just not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems a bit harsh because the parents are exercising their right to make decisions about their child's care.\n\nThe text message the parents sent was polite and explained their reasons. They mentioned safety and avoiding overstimulation. The family's response of threatening to not attend Christmas seems like a disproportionate reaction. The parents are not being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their baby's health, which is a common concern for new parents.\n\nConsidering all this, the parents are not in the wrong. They communicated their stance clearly and respectfully, and their reasons are valid. The family's threat is more about their own feelings of being excluded rather than the parents having done something wrong. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
