We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They sent a message explaining they don't want the baby overstimulated and worried about the flu. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby is full-term, but maybe there's some confusion about 37 weeks being considered early? Wait, full-term is typically between 37-40 weeks, so 37 is still full-term. The parents might have thought it's early, but actually, it's normal. Maybe that's part of the issue? The parents were worried about the flu season and not wanting the baby around too many people. They didn't say no visitors, just not passing the baby around. The family felt offended and pulled the Christmas invite.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? The parents are trying to protect their newborn. Newborns have fragile immune systems, and flu season is a real concern. Limiting handling by multiple people can be a reasonable precaution. The message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe they felt excluded or that the parents are being too controlling. \n\nBut the parents aren't refusing visitors entirely, just not passing the baby. It's a common practice to set boundaries with new babies, especially for health reasons. The family's response of cutting Christmas off seems over the top. The parents have the right to set their own rules for their home. So the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their needs and had valid reasons. The family overreacted. Answer B.\n"
