We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They mentioned flu season as a reason. The family got offended and even said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some sources say 37-38 weeks are considered \"early full term.\" However, the parents might have a valid concern about the baby's health, especially with flu season. Newborns are more vulnerable to infections, and the flu can be serious for them. So, the parents' decision might be based on real medical advice.\n\nThe text they sent was polite, explaining that they don't want the baby over-stimulated and are worried about flu. They invited the family to come over and hang out. The problem arose because the family felt offended. The parents were trying to protect their child, which is a common parental instinct. \n\nBut why would the family take offense? Maybe they didn't understand the health risks, or they felt excluded. The family's reaction seems extreme. The parents didn't refuse to see them entirely; they just set boundaries for the baby's safety. The family's response about not coming to Christmas if that's the case seems like a punishment for trying to protect the baby. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, parents have the right to make decisions that they believe are best for their child's health. The key here is whether the parents acted unreasonably. The text was clear and polite, so there's no indication of rudeness. The family's reaction is more about their own feelings being hurt rather than the parents being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They made a reasonable decision based on health concerns and communicated it respectfully. The family's overreaction doesn't make the parents wrong; it's the family's misunderstanding or overreaction that's the issue here.\n"
