We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn. The baby was born 37 weeks, which is just a week early. They mentioned they wanted to protect the baby from the flu. The family got upset and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. Newborns are vulnerable to infections, especially with the flu. Even though 37 weeks is considered full term, some sources might say that the first few weeks are critical. The parents might have a legitimate concern here. \n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The user's message was polite and offered an alternative (family can come over and hang out). But the family took it as a personal offense. Maybe they didn't expect the refusal and felt unwelcome. However, the parents did set boundaries for the baby's well-being.\n\nI need to check if the user's actions were reasonable. Setting health boundaries is generally acceptable. The key is whether their refusal was communicated clearly and respectfully. The user did mention the reasons and invited the family to visit, which shows they wanted to maintain the relationship. \n\nThe family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas seems overreactive. It's possible they felt excluded or not considered, but the parents did explain their decision. So the user might not be in the wrong here. \n\nAlso, considering cultural norms around family gatherings and babies, some families might expect to hold the baby. However, parents have the right to prioritize their child's health. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The user's main intent was to protect their baby, communicated politely, and offered alternatives. The family's reaction seems harsh. Answer B (Not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
