We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is during Christmas, and the family reacted strongly, even saying not to come if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but being three weeks early might still mean the baby is a bit fragile. The parents are concerned about the flu season and overstimulation. From a health perspective, protecting a newborn from illnesses is important. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so avoiding exposure to germs is standard advice. Overstimulation can also be a valid concern for a new baby, as they need time to adjust.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The parents communicated their wishes in advance, which is reasonable. They didn't say the family couldn't come at all, just that they wouldn't pass the baby around. The family's response seems harsh, possibly misinterpreting the request as a rejection rather than a health precaution. The parents are trying to balance family time with the baby's well-being.\n\nThe text the author sent was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to hang out but wanted to limit handling the baby. The family's backlash to a Christmas gathering exclusion seems extreme. The core issue is whether the parents' decision is selfish or a reasonable precaution.\n\nIn similar situations, it's common for new parents to set boundaries to protect their baby. The key points are the parents' communication of their needs and the family's overreaction. Since the parents gave a heads-up and provided a valid reason, they aren't being inconsiderate without cause. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas seems disproportionate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
