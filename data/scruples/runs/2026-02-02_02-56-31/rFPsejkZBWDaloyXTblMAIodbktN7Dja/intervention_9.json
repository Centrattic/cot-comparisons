We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. They mentioned flu season and wanted to be cautious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. 37 weeks is considered early term but still a full-term baby. However, some sources say that 37-38 weeks might have slightly higher risks compared to 39-40 weeks. The parents are being cautious, which is common, especially during flu season. Parents often want to protect their newborns from infections because babies can get very sick from the flu. \n\nThe family reacted strongly, even threatening to not come to Christmas if they don't get to hold the baby. That's a big reaction. The user's message was polite and explained their reasons. They invited the family to come hang out, just not pass the baby around. The family's response seems disproportionate. \n\nIs the user wrong? Well, they're making a reasonable decision for their child's health. It's their choice how they manage their baby's care. The family's reaction is more about their feelings being hurt than the decision itself. So, the parents aren't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their baby. The answer should be B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
