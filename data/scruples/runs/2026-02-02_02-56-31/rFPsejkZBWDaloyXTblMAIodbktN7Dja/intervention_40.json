We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation started with a Christmas message where they informed the family they wouldn't be passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The family then reacted strongly, saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early term, but still within the full-term range (37-42 weeks). However, even early term babies can be more vulnerable to infections compared to full-term. Flu season is a legitimate concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until 6 months old, so they rely on others to protect them. Overstimulation is also a valid reason, as newborns need a lot of rest and can get overwhelmed by too much interaction.\n\nThe user's message was respectful, explaining the reasons and inviting the family to visit the baby. The family's reaction seems harsh, using a threat about Christmas. That's a strong and hurtful response. The parents are trying to balance family traditions with the health and well-being of their newborn. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Probably not. They have valid, health-based reasons for their decision. The family's response is over the top and unkind. The parents are being responsible, and while family dynamics can be tricky, the parents aren't being unreasonable. They're setting boundaries for the baby's safety. So the answer should be B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
