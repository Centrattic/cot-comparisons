We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but they mention it's barely full term. They decided not to let the family pass around the newborn because of flu season and overstimulation. Their message was meant to be polite, but it caused offense, leading to a family member threatening to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning: they want to protect the baby's health (flu season) and avoid overstimulation. That seems reasonable. Newborns need rest, and exposure to illnesses is a valid concern. The family's reaction seems harsh. The user's message was clear and offered an alternative (visiting instead of passing the baby), which is considerate.\n\nNow, the family's perspective: maybe they felt slighted because they expected to hold the baby. But the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. The family's response of threatening to miss Christmas over this seems over the top. The user isn't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing the baby's health and comfort.\n\nPossible issues: Did the user communicate this in a respectful way? The message starts with a greeting and thanks, then explains the reason. It seems appropriate. The family might have misinterpreted the message as a rejection rather than a precaution. However, the parents have the right to make decisions for their newborn.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user isn't in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision with a valid reason and communicated it politely. The family's reaction is disproportionate. So the answer should be B.\n"
