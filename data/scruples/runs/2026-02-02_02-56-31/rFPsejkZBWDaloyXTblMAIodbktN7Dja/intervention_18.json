We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's newborn was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They texted their family that they wouldn't be passing the baby around during Christmas, citing overstimulation and flu season as reasons. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, 37 weeks is considered full term, but some guidelines might still consider it early. However, the parents are concerned about the baby's health. Flu season is a valid concern, as newborns are more vulnerable to infections. Limiting contact to protect the baby's health seems reasonable.\n\nThe text message was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to hang out. The family's reaction seems harsh. Insisting on passing around the baby despite the parents' wishes could be seen as dismissive of their health concerns. New parents often have boundaries for their child's well-being, and respecting that is important.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents' decision was unreasonable. Since they provided a clear reason and left the door open for interaction, their stance isn't inconsiderate. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems excessive. So, the user isn't the asshole; the answer should be B.\n"
