We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks. They mentioned flu season as a reason. The family got offended and said not to come to Christmas.\n\nHmm. 37 weeks is considered early term, but still within the full-term range. Wait, technically, full term is 37-40 weeks. So 37 is the earliest, but still full term. But the parents are worried about flu season. That makes sense, especially with a newborn's immune system being weaker. However, the family's reaction seems harsh. \n\nThe user's message says they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu exposure, and that the family was welcome to visit. So they're not keeping the baby from the family entirely. The user's request is reasonable. But the family taking it as an offense is a problem. Maybe the user didn't phrase it clearly? Or maybe the family didn't consider the health reasons. \n\nBut the user's actions are protective of their child. It's their right to set boundaries, especially with a newborn. The family's reaction seems excessive. So the answer would be B, the user is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason, even if the family is upset. The user isn't an asshole here.\n"
