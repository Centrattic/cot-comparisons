We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The family is upset and even mentioned they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, right? Wait, actually, full-term is usually between 39 to 41 weeks. So 37 weeks is considered early term. That means the baby might be more vulnerable than a full-term baby, especially during flu season. So the parents' concern about the baby's health is valid. \n\nThe parents sent a message explaining they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. They invited the family to come over, just not to pass the baby around. But the family took offense, leading to the Christmas threat. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have a legitimate reason based on the baby's health. They communicated their decision in advance, which is good. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. Parents have the right to make decisions for their child's well-being. Not allowing people to hold the baby is a common precaution, especially with a slightly premature baby. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems harsh. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Their actions are reasonable and protective. The family overreacted.\n"
