We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The context says it's flu season, so they wanted to keep the baby safe. The family reacted strongly, even threatening to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, 37 weeks is considered a full-term baby. Wait, actually, full term is typically 37 weeks and up. So maybe the user called it \"barely full term\" as a way to justify not letting people hold the baby. But 37 weeks is still full term. However, the user's main reason was flu season and avoiding overstimulation. \n\nNewborns, even full-term, can be vulnerable to illnesses. Especially in flu season, it's common for parents to be cautious. But 37 weeks might not be as fragile as, say, a 34-week preemie. Still, any newborn is susceptible to germs and stress from too many people handling them. \n\nThe user's message was clear and polite, explaining their reasoning. They invited everyone to come over but set boundaries. The family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not attend Christmas because of health precautions seems like overreacting. It's possible the family felt slighted or didn't understand the reasoning. Maybe they were used to holding babies at gatherings and this was a new approach. \n\nBut the parents' priority is the baby's health. They have the right to set those boundaries, especially if they're a new parent. The user didn't say they were refusing all contact, just not passing around the baby. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. Their actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The family's response is the issue, not the user's decision.\n"
