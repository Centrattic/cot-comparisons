We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born at 37 weeks. They mentioned it's flu season, so they wanted to be safe. The family was upset and even said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reason behind their decision. The baby is born three weeks early, which is still considered full term, right? Wait, technically, full term is 37-42 weeks, so 37 weeks is considered early term. But maybe the parents are being cautious because of the flu season. That makes sense because newborns are vulnerable to illnesses.\n\nThe parents' message says they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. They're inviting the family to come over and hang out with the baby, just not to pass him around. The family took it as an offense, leading to a possible Christmas holiday conflict.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they have a valid concern for the baby's health. Flu season is a real risk for infants. Not wanting the baby to be passed around is a common precaution to prevent germs and overstimulation. The parents are setting boundaries, which is their right as caregivers. \n\nHowever, maybe the family didn't understand the reasoning. Perhaps there's a cultural expectation or family tradition around holding the newborn during gatherings. The parents might not have explained the situation clearly enough. But the message they sent does explain their reasons, so it's not like they were being unreasonable without cause.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas for setting a boundary is extreme. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and well-being, which is a responsible decision. They're not being selfish; they're being cautious. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, they're not in the wrong). The parents have a legitimate reason to set that boundary, and the family's reaction is over the top. It's the family's responsibility to respect the parents' wishes if they want to maintain the relationship.\n"
