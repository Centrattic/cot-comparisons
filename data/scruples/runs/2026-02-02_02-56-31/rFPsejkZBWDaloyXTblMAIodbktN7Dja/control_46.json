We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and the parents decided not to let family pass around the baby during a holiday gathering because of flu season. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. 37 weeks is technically full term, but some sources say it's considered \"early term.\" However, the parents are concerned about the flu and not overstimulating the baby. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family reacted strongly, cutting off Christmas plans.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The key points are the parents' right to set boundaries for their child's health and the family's overreaction. The parents aren't being unreasonable; they're taking precautions. The family's response seems harsh and possibly not considering the parents' valid concerns. So, the parents aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
