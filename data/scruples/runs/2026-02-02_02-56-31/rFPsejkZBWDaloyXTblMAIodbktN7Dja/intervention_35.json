We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term or just barely preterm depending on the source. They mentioned it's flu season, so they wanted to limit people holding the baby to keep him safe.\n\nThe family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. The user's message was meant to be polite, explaining they don't want the baby overstimulated and are concerned about the flu. They invited the family over to hang out, just not to pass the baby around.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user was wrong. From a health perspective, protecting a newborn from illness is important. A 37-week baby is still developing, especially the immune system. Even though it's considered full term in some definitions, others say 37 weeks is early. The flu season is a valid concern.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. The user was trying to be cautious, not to be rude. They invited people over, just not to hold the baby. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems extreme. The user's message was clear and polite, so maybe they're not the asshole. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
