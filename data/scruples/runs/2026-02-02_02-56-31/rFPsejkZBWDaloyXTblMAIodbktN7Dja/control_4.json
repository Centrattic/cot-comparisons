We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that their son was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, and they decided not to let the family pass around the newborn during a Christmas visit. The family was offended and even threatened to not come to Christmas if that's how they feel. The author's message was meant to be a heads-up to avoid overstimulating the baby and to be safe during flu season.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered \"barely full term,\" but technically, full-term is 37-40 weeks. So it's a bit premature, but not extremely. The parents are concerned about overstimulation and flu season. Flu season is a real health concern, especially for newborns, whose immune systems are not fully developed. \n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. They felt that the request not to pass the baby around was offensive and even threatened to exclude the parents from Christmas. The parents' message was polite, explaining their concerns and inviting the family over to see the baby. So the author's intention was to protect the baby's health and well-being, which is a common-sense precaution.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. From a health perspective, it's reasonable to avoid passing a newborn around, especially if they were born early. Overstimulation and exposure to potential illnesses are valid reasons. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. Maybe they took it personally, thinking the parents didn't trust them or wanted to keep the baby away, but the parents clearly stated their reasons.\n\nHowever, I should consider cultural or family norms. Some families might expect to hold the baby immediately, and the parents not allowing that could be seen as a slight. But the baby's health should be the priority. The parents have the right to make medical decisions for their child, and flu season is a legitimate health risk. \n\nThe message from the parents was clear and polite, so they didn't act out of spite. The family's response of threatening to not attend Christmas seems excessive. The parents didn't say they weren't inviting them or that they couldn't see the baby; they just asked not to pass him around. The family might need to understand that the parents are being cautious, not rude. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They are making a responsible decision to protect their newborn. The family's reaction is unreasonable. So the answer should be B.\n"
