We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early, exactly at 37 weeks. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas. The user sent a message explaining they were avoiding passing the baby around because of flu season and not over-stimulating the baby.\n\nFirst, 37 weeks is considered full term, but still a bit early. The parents are being cautious, which is understandable, especially with flu season. They didn't say no to the family coming over, just not passing the baby around. But the family took it as an insult. \n\nI need to evaluate if the user's decision was reasonable. Newborns, even at 37 weeks, can be fragile. Parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health. However, family might feel excluded or hurt, thinking they're not trusted or not welcome. The user's message was clear and polite, explaining the reasons. The family's reaction seems extreme, using a Christmas threat. \n\nThe key points are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus family's feelings. Since the parents are being cautious and communicated their reasons, they're probably not in the wrong. The family's response was more about taking it personally rather than the actual decision. So the answer is B.\n"
