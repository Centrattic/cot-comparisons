We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The family was offended and even canceled Christmas plans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but sometimes early by a few weeks. However, the user mentions \"barely full term,\" which might mean they're treating the baby as more fragile. Flu season is a real concern because newborns can get very sick from viruses. \n\nThe user's message was polite and explained their reasons\u2014avoiding overstimulation and flu risk. They invited the family over to meet the baby, just not to hold or pass around. But the family took it as an insult. That's a common issue in family dynamics where boundaries are misunderstood.\n\nIs the user wrong? Well, protecting a newborn's health is a valid reason. Medical advice often suggests limiting exposure for newborns, especially if they're slightly premature. The user isn't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing the baby's safety. The family's reaction seems over the top, but maybe they feel excluded or untrusted. \n\nSo, the user's stance is reasonable, and the problem might lie in the family's inability to understand the boundaries. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because their actions are justified for the baby's well-being.\n"
