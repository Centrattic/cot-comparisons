We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered early. The parents chose not to let the family pass around the baby during a Christmas visit, citing concerns about overstimulation and flu season. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby is born 37 weeks, which is technically full-term, but some might consider it \"barely full term.\" The parents are worried about flu exposure and the baby being overstimulated. They communicated their decision in advance, saying the family can come over but not pass the baby around. However, the family was offended and made a comment about not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, they have valid health concerns. Flu season can be dangerous for newborns, and overstimulation can be a real issue for a new baby. Communicating this in advance is responsible. On the other hand, the family might feel excluded or that their tradition is being disrupted. The parents' message says they can come over and hang out, just not pass the baby around. So they're still inviting the family, but setting boundaries.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because of this decision seems like an overreaction. The parents are making a reasonable request for their baby's safety. The text message from the parents is polite and clear, explaining their reasons. They are not banning the family from the event, just limiting the interaction with the baby. \n\nI think the parents are in the right here. They have a legitimate reason to protect their newborn's health. The family's reaction is the issue, not the parents' decision. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
