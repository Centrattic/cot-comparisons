We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early, during flu season. They sent a message explaining their decision, but the family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas. The user is wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but still slightly early. The parents are concerned about flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction was to say they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nNow, evaluating both sides. The parents have a legitimate concern for the baby's health and well-being. Newborns, even if full-term, can be vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real risk. Also, newborns need time to adjust and may not handle large gatherings well. The parents' decision seems reasonable and responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the family felt offended. Maybe they expected to hold the baby as part of the celebration. Cultural or family traditions might play a role here. However, the parents communicated their stance clearly and politely, which is important. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas over this seems harsh. It's possible the family didn't expect to be excluded from holding the baby and felt it was a personal slight.\n\nBut is the parents' decision really the problem? They made their wishes known upfront to avoid hurt feelings later. They're prioritizing the baby's health, which is a valid reason. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. The parents aren't refusing to see family; they're just limiting physical contact for health reasons. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the parents aren't being selfish for the sake of their own comfort. They have a legitimate concern. The family's response is more about being hurt or feeling dismissed, but the parents' actions don't seem to be in the wrong. So, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
