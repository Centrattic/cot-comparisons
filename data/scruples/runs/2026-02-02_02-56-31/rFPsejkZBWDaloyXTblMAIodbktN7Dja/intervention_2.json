We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born early, even though 37 weeks is considered full term, it's still a bit early. The parents are concerned about the flu season and don't want the baby overstimulated. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh, threatening to not come to Christmas. \n\nIs the user wrong? Well, parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health and safety. Flu season is a valid concern, and not wanting the baby to be passed around can prevent the risk of illness. Overstimulation is also a common concern with newborns. The user's message was clear and offered an alternative (visiting the baby). \n\nThe family's reaction seems over the top. Maybe they didn't expect the refusal and took it personally. But the user isn't obligated to let others handle their baby if they're uncomfortable. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
