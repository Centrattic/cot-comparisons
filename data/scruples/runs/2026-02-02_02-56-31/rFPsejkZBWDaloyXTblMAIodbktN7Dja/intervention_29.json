We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, so 37 weeks. They mentioned flu season and wanted to avoid passing the baby around. The family got offended and said if that's the case, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user is wrong. The key points here are the reasoning behind their decision and the family's reaction. The user's text says they wanted to protect the baby from over-stimulation and the flu. 37 weeks is considered full term in some definitions, but it's still early. Newborns, even at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable to infections. Flu season is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel excluded or not respected. Maybe they were expecting to hold the baby and seeing it as a normal part of family gatherings. The user's message was polite, explaining their reasons. But the family's response was harsh, threatening to exclude them from Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nSo, the user's actions were based on health concerns for their child. The family's reaction seems overly harsh. The user isn't being inconsiderate; they made a reasonable request. The family should understand the health precautions. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
