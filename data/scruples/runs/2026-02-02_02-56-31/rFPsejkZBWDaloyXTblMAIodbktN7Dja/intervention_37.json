We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, so he's a preterm baby. The parents sent a message explaining they don't want to pass him around because of the flu season and overstimulation. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas. The user wants to know if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. Preterm babies can be more vulnerable to infections, right? Flu season is a real concern. Passing around a newborn, especially one born early, could expose them to germs. Also, overstimulation from a lot of people might stress the baby. So from a health and safety perspective, the parents' decision makes sense.\n\nBut then, the family's reaction seems harsh. Throwing out Christmas plans because the parents wanted to protect their baby seems extreme. Maybe the family felt left out or didn't understand the medical reasons. Maybe there was a communication issue. The message the parents sent was polite and offered an alternative\u2014letting the family come over and hang out with the baby. They didn't exclude them, just set a boundary.\n\nThe key points here are the health of the baby versus family expectations. The parents have a valid reason, and the family's response is overreacting. So the answer is likely B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
