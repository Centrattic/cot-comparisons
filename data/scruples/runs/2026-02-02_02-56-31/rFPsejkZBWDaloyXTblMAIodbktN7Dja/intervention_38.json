We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. They sent a message explaining their reasons\u2014flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. The family reacted strongly, saying if that's their choice, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A 37-week baby is considered preterm, even if it's close to full term. Premature babies have higher risks, especially with their immune systems and respiratory issues. Flu season is a valid concern because even a common flu can be dangerous for a preterm infant. Parents have the right to prioritize their child's health and safety, especially when medical advice might support keeping the baby away from crowds and potential illnesses.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel excluded or hurt. They might see the request as them not being trusted or wanted to interact with the grandchild. Cultural or family expectations could play a role here. However, the parents' decision is about the baby's well-being, so their stance is justified.\n\nThe user's message was polite and gave an option for the family to visit, which shows they didn't want to entirely exclude them. The family's reaction seems harsh. It's possible they didn't expect the parents to set such boundaries, but that doesn't mean the parents are wrong. The key here is the parents' responsibility to protect their newborn. Unless there's a cultural context I'm missing where this practice is expected, the parents aren't the asshole. They're making a health-conscious decision for their child.\n"
