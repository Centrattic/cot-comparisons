We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks, which is considered full term but a bit early. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents want to protect the baby from the flu and overstimulation. They communicated their decision in advance, but the family was upset. The key points here are the health and safety of the newborn, the communication of the decision, and the family's reaction.\n\nNewborns, even those born at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable to infections like the flu. It's common for parents to set boundaries regarding visitors and handling of a new baby, especially to prevent the spread of illness. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for newborns' well-being.\n\nThe parents sent a message in advance explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over, just not to pass the baby around. This suggests they were proactive in setting expectations and providing context. The family's reaction seems harsh because they took offense, possibly expecting to hold the baby as part of the celebration.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while family traditions and excitement about a new baby are important, respecting the parents' wishes regarding their child's health is crucial. The parents aren't being unreasonable; they're making a responsible decision. The family's response of threatening to skip Christmas over this seems excessive and could indicate they didn't prioritize the baby's well-being in their reaction.\n\nSo, considering the health of the baby, the communication from the parents, and the family's overreaction, the user isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible choice, and the family's response was unwarranted.\n"
