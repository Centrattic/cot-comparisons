We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family not wanting to pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early, during a family gathering at Christmas. They sent a message explaining their decision due to flu season concerns and the baby being overstimulated. The family felt offended and threatened to exclude them from Christmas if they didn't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. The baby is barely full-term, so maybe the parents are worried about health risks, especially during flu season. Not passing a newborn is common advice from doctors to protect the baby from germs and stress. So their decision is based on medical advice and wanting to protect their child.\n\nOn the other hand, the family reacted strongly, suggesting that the parents shouldn't come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby. That's a harsh response. Family gatherings can be stressful, and not passing the baby might be a reasonable precaution. The parents did invite the family to hang out, so it's not like they're excluding them entirely. They just don't want the baby handled by everyone.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to make decisions about their newborn's health and safety versus the family's expectations. The parents are taking precautions, which is responsible. The family's reaction is over the top, using Christmas as a threat. That doesn't seem fair. So, the parents aren't in the wrong. They communicated their decision politely and still want the family to come. The other side is being unreasonable. So the answer should be B.\n"
