      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family's reaction was pretty strong\u2014they were told not to come to Christmas if that's how they felt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but maybe \"barely\" full-term. The parents are concerned about over-stimulation and the flu season. The message they sent was to let the family know they wouldn't be passing the baby around, but invited them to come over. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' reasons for their decision. Health and safety of the newborn are usually a top priority. Flu season can be a legitimate concern for infants, as they have weaker immune systems. Over-stimulation might also be a valid reason, as newborns can get overwhelmed by too much activity and people.\n\nThe family's reaction seems a bit over the top. Reacting with a threat not to come to Christmas because the parents wanted to protect their baby could indicate that the family didn't take the parents' concerns seriously. The parents were trying to set boundaries for the baby's well-being, not to exclude their relatives. \n\nHowever, maybe the family felt slighted. The message was meant to be polite and informative, but perhaps the family misinterpreted it as a rejection. The parents did invite them over, so they weren't entirely excluding them. \n\nIn terms of whether the parents were in the wrong, their actions were to protect their child's health. It's important to consider that newborn care guidelines often recommend limiting exposure to crowds and sick individuals. The parents made a reasonable, cautious decision. The family's negative reaction seems unwarranted given the parents' good intentions and valid reasons.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents made a responsible choice for their baby's health, and the family's response was inappropriate.\n"
