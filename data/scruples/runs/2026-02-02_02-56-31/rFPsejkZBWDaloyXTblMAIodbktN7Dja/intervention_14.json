We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early, during flu season. The situation escalated to a Christmas argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A 37-week baby is considered a full-term, but some might argue that being three weeks early could make the baby more vulnerable, especially in flu season. Parents might be cautious about exposing the baby to germs, which is a legitimate health concern. Their message was clear and polite, stating they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. They also invited the family to come over, which shows they still wanted to spend time together.\n\nOn the family's side, they felt offended and took it as a personal slight. Maybe they weren't expecting the refusal and took it as a rejection of their presence or a lack of trust in their hygiene. It's possible they didn't consider the health risks as seriously or thought the parents were being overly cautious.\n\nNow, the key points: The parents made a reasonable request to protect their newborn's health. The message was polite and offered an alternative. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. The user's actions are in the best interest of the baby, so it's unlikely they're in the wrong. The family's response might stem from misunderstanding or not valuing the health concerns enough. So, the answer should be B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
