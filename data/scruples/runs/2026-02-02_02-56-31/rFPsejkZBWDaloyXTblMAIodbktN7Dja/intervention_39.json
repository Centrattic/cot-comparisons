We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby is at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but technically a bit early. The user sent a message explaining they don't want to pass the baby around due to flu season and overstimulation. The family took offense and mentioned they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is still considered full-term in many medical definitions, but some hospitals might have different protocols. However, the user's main concern is about the flu season and avoiding overstimulation. That seems reasonable, especially if the baby is still adjusting to life outside the womb.\n\nThe user's message was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to come over. They didn't refuse interaction entirely, just not passing the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh, turning it into a holiday conflict. The user's intentions were protective, not exclusionary. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family felt excluded or thought the user was being overly cautious. But considering flu season and a slightly early birth, the user's concerns are valid. The key here is whether the user's actions were reasonable. Since they provided an alternative (visiting) and explained their reasons, they might not be in the wrong. The family's response seems disproportionate. \n\nSo, probably answer B (not in the wrong). They took precautions, communicated clearly, and offered an alternative. The family's reaction is the issue here, not the user's decision.\n"
