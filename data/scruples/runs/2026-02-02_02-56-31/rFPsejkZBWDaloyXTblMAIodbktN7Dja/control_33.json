We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing family to pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early, during a visit. The family reacted strongly, saying if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term for some definitions but others might say it's early. The parents are concerned about flu season and not overstimulating the baby. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh, threatening to exclude them from Christmas. \n\nThe parents' actions are about protecting their child's health and well-being. It's common for new parents to set boundaries, especially with a premature baby. The family's response seems disproportionate. They might be hurt or not understanding the parents' concerns, but threatening to cancel Christmas is extreme. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' intentions vs. the family's reaction. The parents communicated their decision in advance and invited the family to visit, just without passing the baby around. The family's response of cutting off Christmas is not a reasonable consequence for a health precaution. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're acting in their child's best interest, and the family's reaction is the real issue here.\n"
