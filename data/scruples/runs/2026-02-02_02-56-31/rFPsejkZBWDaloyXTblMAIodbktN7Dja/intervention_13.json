We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn son, who was born three weeks early. The context is that they mentioned this in a message, and it led to a family conflict where they were essentially told not to come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but still early. The parents are concerned about the flu season and don't want the baby overstimulated. That makes sense because newborns, even if born at 37 weeks, are vulnerable. The flu can be dangerous for infants, and overstimulation isn't good for them either.\n\nThen there's the family reaction. The parents just wanted to let everyone know in advance, but the family took it as an insult or a personal slight. The message they sent was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to come over. They didn't say \"no\" outright, just that they wouldn't pass the baby around. The family's response was quite harsh, telling them not to come to Christmas if they feel that way. That seems disproportionate.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, the parents are making a reasonable decision to protect their baby's health. Socially, they communicated their decision politely, which is important. The family's reaction, however, seems overly sensitive. It's common for new parents to have rules about handling their babies, especially in the early weeks. The key here is that the parents explained their reasoning and kept the door open for the family to visit. The family's response doesn't take into account the parents' concerns and instead treats the parents' decision as a rejection.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are in the right for prioritizing their baby's health and safety. The family's reaction is unreasonable, making the parents not the asshole in this situation.\n"
