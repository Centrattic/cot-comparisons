We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is just a bit before the full term. The parents wanted to be cautious because it's flu season, so they informed the family they wouldn't be passing the baby around. The family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical advice. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically considered full-term, but some sources say that 37-38 weeks are considered early term. Even so, premature babies can be more susceptible to infections. The flu season being a factor here is important. Parents might want to protect their newborn from illnesses, so limiting handling by others could be a precaution.\n\nHowever, the parents' message might have been perceived as exclusionary. They invited the family over but mentioned not passing the baby. The family might feel offended because they expected to hold the baby, especially if they're grandparents or close relatives. The way the message was phrased could come off as dismissive or not considering the family's feelings. Maybe the parents didn't frame it as a health concern but more as a personal choice, leading to misunderstandings.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have a right to make decisions about their child's health. If they have medical reasons, they should prioritize that. The family's reaction seems harsh, but the parents could have handled the communication better. Maybe they should have explained the medical concerns more clearly or offered alternatives, like limiting handling or ensuring visitors are healthy.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit of a gray area. The parents are acting in the baby's best interest, which is valid. However, the way they communicated it might have hurt feelings. The family's overreaction is extreme, but the parents could have been more empathetic in their message. So the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe they could have handled it differently to avoid conflict.\n"
