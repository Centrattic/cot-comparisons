We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn during Christmas. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The parents mentioned flu season as a reason. The family reacted strongly, threatening to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. A 37-week premature baby is considered \"barely full term\" but still, preemies are more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real concern. The parents are trying to protect the baby from overstimulation and potential sickness. \n\nOn the other hand, the family might have felt excluded or insulted. Family gatherings can be important, and not being able to interact with the newborn might feel like a barrier. The parents' message seems polite and gives options to come over and hang out, just not to hold the baby. But the family took offense, which might be due to different expectations or sensitivity around family traditions.\n\nThe key points here are the health and safety of the baby versus the family's feelings. The parents are acting in the baby's best interest. The message was clear and respectful, offering alternatives. The family's reaction seems excessive, but maybe they felt disrespected or not considered. However, the parents have a right to set boundaries for their child's health. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and if the action was reasonable. Here, the parents' intent is to protect the baby, which is reasonable. The family overreacted. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
