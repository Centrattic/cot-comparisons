We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about not allowing family to pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They mentioned it's flu season, so they wanted to keep the baby safe. The family got offended and even said not to come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A newborn, even if born at 37 weeks, is still considered early. The parents are concerned about overstimulation and flu risks. It's common for new parents to set boundaries to protect their baby's health, especially during flu season. They clearly communicated their decision in a friendly manner, saying the family can come over but not pass the baby around. That seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not come to Christmas over this decision is extreme. The parents didn't say no to visiting; they just wanted to limit handling. The family's response might stem from not understanding the health concerns or feeling excluded. But it's important to consider the baby's well-being here.\n\nNew parents have the right to prioritize their child's health. Flu can be dangerous for infants, and overstimulation can stress the baby. The initial message was polite and gave an option to hang out. The family's reaction of cutting off Christmas seems like an overreaction. So, the parents aren't in the wrong. They made a logical decision for their baby's safety, and the family's response was inappropriate. Answer B.\n"
