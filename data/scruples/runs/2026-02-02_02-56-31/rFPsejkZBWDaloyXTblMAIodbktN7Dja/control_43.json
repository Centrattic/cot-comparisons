You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing family to pass around their nearly full-term newborn during Christmas. The baby was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. The parents sent a message saying they won't be passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and because of flu season concerns. The family was offended and threatened to not come to Christmas if they feel that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasons. 37 weeks is considered full-term, but it's still a bit early. The flu season is a valid health concern. New parents might be cautious, especially with a preterm baby. They might be worried about infections or the baby being overwhelmed by too much handling.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might have felt excluded or not trusted. Maybe they expected a certain tradition, like passing around the baby as a way to celebrate. The parents' message was clear and polite, but perhaps the family took it as a slight. The threat about not coming to Christmas seems harsh, but maybe the parents didn't realize how important this tradition was to the family.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and well-being. They communicated their decision in advance. They invited the family over, just not to handle the baby. That's reasonable. The family's reaction seems over the top. However, maybe the parents could have explained more or been more flexible. But given the health concern, their stance is understandable. So the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
