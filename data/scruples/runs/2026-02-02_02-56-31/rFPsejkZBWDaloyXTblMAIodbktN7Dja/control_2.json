      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is just a week before the typical full term (which is 40 weeks). They wanted to be cautious because it's flu season and didn't want to let family pass around the baby. They sent a text explaining this, but the family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for this decision.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically considered full-term now, right? Wait, I remember that full-term is from 37 to 40 weeks. So 37 weeks is still considered full term, but maybe some people think it's not quite full yet. But the parents are concerned about the flu season. Flu season means more people might be carrying the virus, and newborns have weaker immune systems, so it's common for parents to be cautious.\n\nBut why would the family take offense? Maybe they felt excluded or thought the parents were being overly cautious. The text the author sent was polite, saying they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. That seems reasonable. However, maybe the family interpreted it as the parents not trusting them with the baby, or thinking the family is a risk. That could lead to hurt feelings, especially around a holiday when people expect to celebrate with their families.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting this boundary? On one hand, the parents have the right to protect their newborn, especially if they have medical concerns. On the other hand, the family might feel that the parents are being exclusionary without a valid reason. But since the baby is at 37 weeks, which is full term, maybe some family members thought the baby was healthy enough. However, even full-term babies can be at risk for flu, especially if they're very young. Newborns under 6 months can't get the flu vaccine, so they're more vulnerable.\n\nThe key here is the parents' decision to prioritize the baby's health. They didn't say no to the family coming over, just not passing the baby around. They still want everyone to come and hang out. So maybe the family took it as a rejection rather than a precaution. But the parents are not wrong for wanting to protect their child. The family's reaction is more about their own hurt feelings than the parents' right to set a boundary.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents are acting in the baby's best interest, and their message was polite and justified given the flu season and the baby's age. The family's response seems overreactive and unnecessary.\n"
