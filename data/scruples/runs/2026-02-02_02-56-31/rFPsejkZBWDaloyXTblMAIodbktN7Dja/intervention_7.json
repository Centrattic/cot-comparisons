We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user had a baby born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They decided not to let family pass around the newborn during Christmas, citing flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. The family took offense and threatened to exclude them from Christmas if they weren't allowed to pass the baby. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the newborn. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term in some definitions, but still might be more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a valid concern, especially for a newborn's immune system. The parents are making a decision to protect their child's health, which is a common and responsible action.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. They were told beforehand, and the parents invited them over to hang out with the baby, just not to pass him around. The family's response of cutting off contact over this seems disproportionate. The parents communicated their reasons clearly and offered an alternative (visiting but not handling the baby), which is reasonable.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to make medical decisions for their child and the family's overreaction. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing their baby's health. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas is more about them being upset rather than the parents being in the wrong. So, the answer is B; the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
