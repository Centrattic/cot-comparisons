We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but maybe a bit early. The author decided not to let the family pass around their baby because of flu season concerns and to prevent overstimulation. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mentioned flu season as a reason, which is a valid health concern, especially for a newborn. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so exposure to a lot of people could be risky. Also, overstimulation is a common concern with new babies, as they need a lot of rest and can get overwhelmed by too much activity.\n\nThe author's message was polite and explained the reasons. They invited the family to come over and hang out, just not pass the baby around. So, they're not cutting off interactions entirely, just limiting direct handling. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014threatening to not attend Christmas if the author doesn't change their mind. That seems like an overreaction. The family might be taking it personally, maybe expecting a certain level of interaction that the parents are trying to avoid for valid reasons.\n\nAnother angle: cultural or family expectations. Maybe the family is used to holding the baby right away, and the parents' refusal felt like a rejection. But the parents have a duty to their child's well-being, so their decision should be respected. It's their choice how to manage their baby's care, even if it upsets others.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They provided a clear reason, which is health and safety. The family's response is more about their feelings than the baby's needs. The key points are flu season risks and overstimulation, both legitimate. The author is not being unreasonable here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
