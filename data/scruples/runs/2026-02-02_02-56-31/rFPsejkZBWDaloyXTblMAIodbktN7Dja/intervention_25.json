We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. The family got offended and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks. That's considered full-term, right? Wait, but some sources say 37-38 weeks is \"early term,\" which is slightly earlier than the full 39-40 weeks. So maybe there's some medical consideration here. The parents didn't want to pass the baby around because it's flu season and they wanted to be safe. They sent a message explaining this, but the family took offense and there's a threat about not coming to Christmas. \n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole here. The options are A for yes (in the wrong) and B for no. \n\nHmm. From a health perspective, newborns, even those born at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable to infections like the flu. So the parents' concern about not passing the baby around is medically sound. The message they sent seems polite and explains their reasons. They're not being unreasonable, just cautious. \n\nOn the other hand, the family reacted negatively. Maybe they felt excluded or that their presence is being questioned. Maybe they didn't expect the parents to set such a boundary, especially around a family event. The threat about Christmas is a bit heavy-handed. \n\nSo the parents are making a reasonable request for their baby's health. The family overreacted. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
