      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but barely. The family was upset and even threatened to not come to Christmas if they couldn't hold the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what's considered a full-term pregnancy. I think full-term is usually 37 to 41 weeks. So 37 weeks is technically full-term, but some sources might say 39 weeks and up for optimal health. But even if it's full-term, being 37 weeks might mean the baby is slightly more vulnerable. The parents are concerned about flu season and overstimulation. That makes sense because newborns have underdeveloped immune systems and need to avoid germs. Also, too much handling can be stressful for a baby.\n\nThe parents sent a message saying they won't pass the baby around but are open to family coming over. The family took offense. The parents are now asking if they're the asshole. \n\nSo, the main points here are health concerns and family expectations. The parents are acting in the best interest of their baby's health. Flu season is a real risk, and not wanting the baby to be overstimulated is a common precaution. However, the family might feel excluded or hurt, especially during a family-oriented time like Christmas. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a health perspective, they're making a responsible decision. They didn't completely exclude the family; they invited them to hang out. The issue is the family's reaction. The parents communicated their reasons clearly and offered an alternative. The family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas seems excessive. \n\nBut maybe some people might think that having a new baby is a time to share joy with extended family, and not allowing them to hold the baby could be seen as snubbing. However, the parents have a valid medical reason, even if the baby is full-term. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They prioritized the baby's health and safety, which is their responsibility. The family's reaction is more about their own feelings than the baby's well-being. The key is that the parents didn't prevent the family from being present, just from handling the baby. That's a reasonable precaution, especially in flu season.\n"
