We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The family reacted strongly, threatening to not come to Christmas if they didn't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is considered early term but still technically full term. However, some sources say that babies born between 37-38 weeks can have slightly higher risks compared to those born at 39 weeks or later. But the line between term and preterm can be blurry. The parents' concern about the flu season is valid because newborns are more vulnerable to infections. \n\nThe parents' message was clear: they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. They invited the family to come over but set a boundary about not passing the baby. The family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening not to attend Christmas because of this policy seems like an overreaction. The parents are making a reasonable health and safety decision for their child. \n\nI should also think about social norms. While family traditions and interactions are important, the parents' health concerns should take precedence. It's their right to set boundaries for their newborn's well-being. The family's response might stem from not understanding the risks or feeling excluded. However, the parents are not being inconsiderate; they are making a responsible choice.\n\nAnother angle is the communication. The message was polite and explained their reasons. They didn't shut out the family completely but set a specific boundary. The family might have misinterpreted the message or felt their traditions were being ignored. But the parents are not in the wrong for prioritizing their baby's health. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The parents are not in the wrong. They made a responsible decision based on health concerns. The family's reaction is excessive. The answer should be B.\n"
