      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born 37 weeks, which is just a bit early, and they wanted to avoid passing the baby around during Christmas because of flu season. They sent a message explaining this, but their family took offense and said not to come to Christmas if that's how they feel. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born 3 weeks early, which is 37 weeks. While 37 weeks is technically full term, it's still considered early, and preemies can be more vulnerable to illnesses. The parents are worried about the flu, which is a valid concern, especially during flu season. They wanted to prevent the baby from being overstimulated, which is common for new parents to want, especially with a newborn.\n\nThe message they sent was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family over to hang out. They didn't say the family couldn't see the baby, just that they wouldn't be passing him around. The family's reaction seems extreme. Telling them not to come to Christmas because of this seems like an overreaction. The parents were trying to protect their baby's health, which is a responsible and caring action.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family felt slighted because they wanted to hold the baby, which is a common desire for relatives. But the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. The key here is that the parents are not being inconsiderate; they're making a health decision. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems harsh and unnecessary.\n\nSo, the parents are not in the wrong here. They communicated their decision clearly and respectfully, and their reasons are valid. The family's reaction is the issue, not the parents' decision. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
