      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is the asshole or not. Let me start by reading the details again carefully.\n\nThe user had a son born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They told their family in advance that they wouldn't be passing the newborn around during Christmas. The family got offended, and some even said they shouldn't come to Christmas. The user is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, let me recall that 37 weeks is considered a late preterm birth. These babies can have some health risks compared to full-term babies (which is 40 weeks). Even though 37 is close to term, it's still slightly premature. The parents' concern is about the flu season and overstimulation. They wanted to keep the baby safe and calm, which makes sense given the early birth.\n\nThe text they sent was: \"Merry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\"\n\nSo the parents are setting boundaries, which is common when a new baby is born. They\u2019re not refusing visitors, just not allowing the baby to be passed around. They explain the reasons\u2014flu season and overstimulation. The family's reaction was that they felt offended and pulled the Christmas invitation. \n\nNow, the user is asking if they are in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the key here is that the parents are prioritizing the health and well-being of their newborn. Even if the baby is doing okay, medical advice often tells parents to protect preemies from crowds and germs, especially in flu season. Also, newborns, even full-term, can be overstimulated by too much noise and handling. So the parents are being cautious. \n\nBut their family took it as an offense. Maybe the family didn't understand the reasons, or perhaps they felt excluded. However, the parents made it clear they were open to visitors and wanted to see them. The family's response seems a bit harsh. It's their choice to not have the baby handled, and if the family can't respect that, even if they're upset, then maybe the parents aren't in the wrong. \n\nI should also consider cultural aspects. In some families, not allowing them to hold the baby might be seen as a slight, but the parents' message was polite and explained the reasons. The family's reaction might stem from feeling that their wishes are being ignored, but the parents are making a responsible decision for their child's health. \n\nSo, in my view, the parents are not in the wrong. They are taking precautions for their baby's well-being, and the family's overreaction seems unwarranted. The parents didn't say they wouldn't see the family, just that the baby wouldn't be passed around. That's a reasonable boundary. The family should respect that. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
