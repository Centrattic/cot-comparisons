We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby is at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe slightly early. The parents sent a message saying they wouldn't be passing the baby around because they want to keep him safe from the flu, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's their stance. The question is if the parents are the asshole here.\n\nHmm. First, I need to think about the context. Newborns, especially if they're even a bit early, are more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real risk, so the parents have a legitimate health concern. They're not being unreasonable by wanting to protect their baby. \n\nOn the other hand, the family took offense. Maybe they felt excluded or that their presence was being restricted. But is the right to protect a newborn more important than family expectations? Probably yes. The parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health. \n\nThe text they sent was polite and explained the reason. They invited the family over, so it's not like they're avoiding interaction entirely. They just don't want the baby passed around. The family's reaction seems harsh. They're using the baby's presence as a reason to exclude the parents from Christmas, which is an overreaction. \n\nSo, the parents aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
