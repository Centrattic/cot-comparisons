We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who didn't let their family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. They mentioned flu season as a concern and wanted to avoid overstimulation. The family took offense and threatened to exclude them from Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but maybe there's still some concern because it's early. Flu season is a legitimate health concern, especially for infants who can't get vaccinated until they're six months old. Parents are often advised to limit exposure to prevent illness. So the author's reasoning seems valid from a health perspective.\n\nThen there's the cultural aspect. In some families, passing around a newborn is a tradition. The parents might have felt that the author was being exclusive or not trusting them with the baby. However, the author did explain their reasons, so maybe the family's reaction was too harsh. The author's message was polite and invited the family to visit, just not to pass the baby. \n\nThe family's response was to say not to come to Christmas if that's how they feel. That seems like a heavy-handed reaction. The parents made a reasonable request for their child's safety, and the family took it personally. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their baby's health. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas is the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They had valid reasons and communicated them clearly. The family's reaction was over the top.\n"
