You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is during flu season, and the family got offended, leading to a Christmas issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health of the newborn. Since the baby was born early, even if it's just three weeks, there might be health concerns. Early babies can be more vulnerable to infections, so avoiding exposure to a lot of people, especially during flu season, makes sense from a medical standpoint. The parents might be trying to protect their child's health.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The parents sent a message explaining their decision, saying they don't want the baby over-stimulated and are worried about the flu. The family took offense and mentioned not inviting them to Christmas. That seems harsh. The parents are not refusing to see family entirely; they're just not letting them pass the baby around. They still want the family to come over and hang out. So the main issue here is the family's reaction versus the parents' precaution.\n\nI should think about cultural norms too. In some cultures, not passing the baby around might be seen as rude or untrustworthy. But given the health concerns, it's a reasonable precaution. The parents are prioritizing their child's safety, which is a valid reason. The family's response seems excessive. The parents are being clear and polite, so they're not being inconsiderate. They're setting boundaries for a good reason.\n\nAnother angle: the parents could have offered alternatives, like a safer time to meet or a smaller gathering. But in the message, they did invite the family over to hang out, just not with handling the baby. That seems balanced. The family might feel excluded or hurt, but the parents are not being unreasonable. The flu risk is real, and over-stimulation for a newborn is a legitimate concern, especially if the baby is still recovering from being born early.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents aren't in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision to protect their baby's health, and the family's reaction is disproportionate. The answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
