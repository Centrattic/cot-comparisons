We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early (37 weeks). They mentioned it's flu season, so they wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby and protect him from germs. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term or late preterm. But the parents are being cautious. Flu season is a real concern, especially for infants. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so exposure to germs can be risky. The parents' message was about not passing the baby around but still inviting the family over. \n\nThe family reacted strongly, threatening to exclude them from Christmas if they won't pass the baby. The author is questioning if their stance is wrong. \n\nIs 37 weeks considered full term? Yes, generally 37-42 weeks is full term. However, even late preterm babies might need extra care. The parents are prioritizing their child's health. The family's reaction seems harsh. It's possible they didn't take into account the health concerns. \n\nThe parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. They still invited the family. The family's response of not attending Christmas over this seems extreme. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common to have boundaries with newborns, especially in terms of health and stimulation. The parents have the right to set these boundaries. The family's reaction might stem from not understanding the medical reasons or feeling excluded. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents aren't in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision to protect their child's health, communicated it politely, and the family's reaction is what's problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
