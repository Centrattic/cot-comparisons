We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. They sent a text explaining they don't want the baby overstimulated and worried about the flu. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. The user wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered early term, so there might be more precautions needed. Flu season is a real concern, and parents might be more cautious to protect their baby. The text message they sent was polite and gave a reason. It's about the baby's well-being, which is a valid concern.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. They felt offended and used a harsh response about not coming to Christmas. That seems a bit extreme. The parents are making a reasonable request to protect their child, which doesn't seem like an overreaction. The family's response might be more about their own feelings of being excluded rather than a legitimate issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The answer here should be B (Not in the wrong) because they're acting in their baby's best interest. The family's reaction is more about them being upset rather than the parents having done something wrong. The parents communicated their wishes clearly and politely, so they're not being selfish or inconsiderate. The family's threat about Christmas is out of proportion. Therefore, the user isn't the asshole.\n"
