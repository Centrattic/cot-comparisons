We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. They mentioned it's flu season, and they wanted to be safe. The family took offense and threatened not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full term, but being three weeks early might make them more susceptible to illnesses. Flu season is a valid concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months old, so any exposure could be risky. Their decision to limit physical contact for the baby's safety seems reasonable.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The user's message was polite and explanatory, inviting family over but setting a boundary. It's possible the family took offense because they expected to hold the baby, which is common in such gatherings. However, the parents have the right to prioritize their child's health. The threat about not coming to Christmas might stem from feeling excluded or offended, but that's more about the family's reaction than the parents' actions.\n\nI should also consider cultural or familial expectations. Some families might feel that not allowing them to hold the baby is a slight. But the parents clearly communicated their reasons, so it's not like they were being secretive or rude. The key here is whether the parents acted responsibly versus being selfish. Since they provided an explanation and still allowed the family to visit, their actions seem justified.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the user is not in the wrong) because they made a responsible decision for their baby's health while still including the family in the visit.\n"
