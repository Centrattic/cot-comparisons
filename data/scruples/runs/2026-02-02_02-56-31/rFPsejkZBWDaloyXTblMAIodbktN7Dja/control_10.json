We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is technically full-term, but maybe the parents are being cautious because of flu season. They sent a message explaining they wouldn't pass the baby around, just wanted family to visit but not handle him. Then the family took offense and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical advice. 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some sources might say that even a few weeks early can have risks. However, the parents' concern about flu season is valid. Newborns, especially those born early, have underdeveloped immune systems. So the parents are trying to protect the baby's health.\n\nBut the family felt offended. Maybe they expected to hold the baby, and the parents' message came off as excluding them. The parents' message says they don't want the baby over-stimulated and have flu concerns. They invited the family to come over, just not to pass the baby around. So the parents set boundaries, which is reasonable.\n\nIs there a misunderstanding here? The family might have interpreted the message as not wanting them to visit at all, but the parents did invite them. The parents are being cautious, which is responsible. However, maybe the way they communicated could have been clearer or more empathetic. They might have considered the family's feelings or offered alternatives, like hand sanitizer or masks if flu is a concern.\n\nBut even so, the parents have a right to set boundaries for their child's health. It's not about being selfish but protective. The family's reaction seems harsh. Ending the Christmas gathering over this seems extreme, but the parents could have anticipated some pushback and addressed it more gently.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, sometimes family expectations can clash with new parents' needs. The parents are trying to balance safety with family time. Their actions are in the baby's best interest. So, the parents are not in the wrong. The family's reaction is unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
