We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but maybe they're being cautious because of flu season.\n\nThe family reacted strongly, even threatening not to come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around. The user's message seems polite and clear, explaining their reasons. They mention wanting to keep the baby safe from the flu and not overstimulating him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is technically full-term, but it's still early. Some babies born at 37 might need more care. However, the main issue here is the family's reaction. The parents are making a reasonable request to protect their newborn, which is a common concern. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation of passing the baby around during family gatherings? Maybe in their family, that's a tradition, and they feel excluded or insulted. But the parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their child. Choosing not to have others hold the baby for safety isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe family's response seems harsh. Threatening to exclude them from Christmas is a big reaction. The parents explained their reasons upfront, so it's not like they were rude or dismissive. The family might be taking it personally, but the parents' priority is their baby's health. \n\nSo, the parents aren't in the wrong here. They communicated their decision clearly and had valid reasons. The family overreacted, so the parents aren't the asshole. Answer B.\n"
