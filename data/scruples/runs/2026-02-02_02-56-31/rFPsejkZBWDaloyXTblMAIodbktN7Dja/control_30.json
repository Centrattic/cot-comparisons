      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who had their baby born at 37 weeks and decided not to let family pass around the newborn during a family gathering. The family reacted strongly, cutting off Christmas plans. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born three weeks early, which is still considered full-term, but maybe there's some concern about the baby's health. The parents mentioned wanting to avoid overstimulation and flu season risks. They invited the family to come over but set a boundary about not passing the baby.\n\nNow, the question is whether setting that boundary is wrong. From a health perspective, new parents often have valid reasons to limit handling of a newborn, especially if there are health concerns. Flu season is a legitimate worry, as newborns can't get vaccinated and are more vulnerable. Overstimulation is also a common concern for new parents trying to adjust.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because they didn't want to pass the baby around might be an overreaction. It's possible the family didn't consider the parents' reasons or felt slighted. However, there's a cultural aspect here too\u2014some families might see not passing the baby as a slight, especially if they're excited to meet the newborn.\n\nBut the parents did communicate their decision in advance and invited the family to visit. They didn't say no one could see the baby, just that they wouldn't be passing him around. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems extreme and possibly hurtful. The parents were trying to be considerate and safe, not to exclude people maliciously.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the parents were protecting their child's health and their own ability to manage the situation. The family's reaction was more about taking offense rather than a valid reason. So the parents aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
