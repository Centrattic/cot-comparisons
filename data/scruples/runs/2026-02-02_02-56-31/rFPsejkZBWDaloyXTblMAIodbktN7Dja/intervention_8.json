We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not letting their family hold their newborn during Christmas. The baby was born 3 weeks early, so 37 weeks, which is still considered full term, but maybe they wanted to be cautious. They sent a message explaining they don't want to pass the baby around because of flu season and overstimulation. The family reacted badly and said if that's the case, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nHmm, first, I need to determine if their actions are justified. The parents are worried about the baby's health. Flu season can be a valid concern, especially for a preterm baby. Even though 37 weeks is full term, some doctors might still be cautious because preemies can be more vulnerable. They also mention overstimulation, which is common for newborns, especially in a busy family gathering.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because they won't hold the baby seems extreme. The parents are setting boundaries for their child's well-being. It's common for new parents to be protective, especially with a preterm baby. The message they sent was polite and explained the reasons, so they didn't act out of spite.\n\nHowever, maybe the family felt excluded or that their relationship was being rejected. But the parents didn't say no visitors; they just didn't want the baby passed around. The family could still come over and be with the baby in a way that's comfortable for the parents. The key here is whether the parents' concerns are reasonable and if the family overreacted.\n\nIn the AITA community, the focus is usually on whether the person acted wrongly. Since the parents are prioritizing their baby's health and using common sense, especially in flu season, their decision seems reasonable. The family's response is more about their own feelings of being snubbed rather than the parents' actions. So the answer would likely be B (No, not in the wrong). They're not being inconsiderate; they're being cautious for their child's sake.\n"
