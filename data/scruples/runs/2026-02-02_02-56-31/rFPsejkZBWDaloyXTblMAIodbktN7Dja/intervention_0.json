We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby is at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but still slightly early. The user's message was intended to be a heads-up during flu season, but it caused offense, leading to a family member suggesting they shouldn't come to Christmas if they feel that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health of the newborn. While 37 weeks is considered full term in many places, some doctors might still have concerns about exposure to germs, especially during flu season. The parents' decision to limit handling could be protective. However, the user's message might have come across as dismissive or not open to discussion, especially if the family felt excluded or not given options.\n\nThe text they sent was polite, but maybe the wording could have been more inclusive. Phrases like \"you're welcome to come over and hang out\" might not have been clear enough. Maybe the family felt it was a refusal rather than a suggestion for a safer interaction. Also, cultural expectations around family gatherings might play a role. Some families might feel that not allowing them to hold the baby is a form of exclusion, especially during a significant holiday like Christmas.\n\nAnother angle is the reaction itself. The family's response was to cut off Christmas plans if the parents didn't allow passing the baby around. That seems extreme. It's possible the parents' message was misinterpreted, or the family felt disrespected. The user might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries for their child's health, but the way it was communicated and the family's reaction could both be points of contention.\n\nIn terms of medical advice, 37 weeks is still a viable term, but depending on the baby's health, avoiding overstimulation and germs is a common precaution. The parents have the right to make decisions in the child's best interest. However, the family's reaction might stem from feeling that the message was too strict or not accommodating enough. The user could have offered alternatives, like designated times for interaction or specifying how to handle the baby safely.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the parents are trying to protect their newborn, which is reasonable, and the family's reaction is over the top. The user isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, but maybe there's room for better communication to prevent misunderstandings. Since the question is whether they're an asshole, the answer would lean towards B (they are not in the wrong) because the parents are acting in their child's best interest, even if the communication could be improved.\n"
