      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family then took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some doctors might still say they're at a slightly higher risk for certain issues compared to a baby born at 39 weeks or later. So, the parents' concern about the flu and overstimulation is understandable. Premature babies, even by three weeks, might need extra care in their first few weeks.\n\nBut wait, the baby was born exactly at 37 weeks. The line between preterm and full-term is sometimes a bit blurry. Some sources say 37 weeks is considered early term, but it's still full term. However, the parents' decision to limit handling might be a precaution. They mentioned flu season, which is a valid concern since newborns can't get the flu vaccine until 6 months, and they're more vulnerable to infections.\n\nThe parents' message was polite. They said the family could come over and hang out, just not pass the baby around. They mentioned overstimulation and flu concerns. So, the parents were clear and respectful in their request. The family's reaction of being offended and threatening to exclude them from Christmas seems harsh. Family dynamics can vary, but in this case, the parents had a legitimate reason to set boundaries for their child's health.\n\nHowever, maybe the family felt slighted because they expected to hold the baby, which is a common practice. But the parents had a medical reason to be cautious. The key here is whether the parents' actions were reasonable. Since 37 weeks is still full term, but the parents are being cautious, it's their right to set those boundaries. The family's reaction might stem from not understanding the medical reasoning or feeling that their traditions are being ignored.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's becoming more accepted to prioritize a newborn's health by limiting visitors or handling, especially in the first few weeks. So, the parents aren't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The family's response is more about their feelings than the actual medical risk. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
