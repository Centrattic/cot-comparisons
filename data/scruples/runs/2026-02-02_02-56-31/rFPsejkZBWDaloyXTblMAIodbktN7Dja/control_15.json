      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. The situation is that the parents wanted to be safe during flu season and communicated their decision, but the family was offended and mentioned not coming to Christmas. The text they sent was polite, explaining their reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered early term, which is still technically full term but just a week early. However, even though they're full term, early-term babies can sometimes be more vulnerable to illnesses compared to those born at 39-40 weeks. So the parents' concern about the flu is valid from a health perspective. \n\nThe parents didn't say no to the family being around the baby; they just didn't want the baby passed around. They invited the family to come over and hang out, just without holding the baby. That seems reasonable. The family took offense, which might be because they felt excluded or not part of the celebration. But the parents' primary concern is the baby's health, which is a common concern with newborns, especially in the first few months. \n\nNow, whether the parents are in the wrong. The key factors here are the health of the baby versus the family's feelings. The parents communicated their decision respectfully and gave a clear reason. They didn't ban the family from the event, just limited the interaction with the baby. The family's reaction seems harsh, but does that make the parents right or wrong? \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for new parents to have rules about handling their newborns, especially for health reasons. So the parents are not being unreasonable. The family's response is more about their own feelings being hurt rather than the parents' actions being objectively wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents are justified in their decision to protect their baby's health, especially during flu season, and they communicated it politely. The family's reaction is overly punitive and not based on the parents' actions being in the wrong.\n"
