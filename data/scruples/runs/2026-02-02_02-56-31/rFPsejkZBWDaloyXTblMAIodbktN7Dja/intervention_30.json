We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not letting family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby is at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe slightly early. The family said they wouldn't be passing the baby around to protect him from the flu, but then the family got upset and mentioned not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is generally considered full term, but some sources say that 39 weeks is optimal. However, the user might be cautious because the baby is a bit early. Flu season is a real concern, as newborns are more vulnerable. The parents' decision to limit handling to protect the baby's health could be seen as responsible.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The user's message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's response was harsh, suggesting they might not come to Christmas. That seems over the top. The parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being, especially as new parents who might be learning what's best for their baby.\n\nCultural factors might play a role too. In some families, not allowing immediate family to hold a newborn could be seen as a slight, even if the parents have good reasons. However, the user's message was clear and offered an alternative (visiting the baby without passing him around), so the family had the choice to visit without touching the baby. The family's reaction of cutting off the holiday seems extreme and possibly inconsiderate of the parents' wishes.\n\nI think the parents are in the right here. They have a legitimate reason to protect their newborn. The family's reaction is the problem, not the parents' decision. So the answer should be B.\n"
