We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The family got offended and threatened not to come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around. The author sent a message explaining their decision due to flu season and wanting to avoid overstimulating the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are reasonable. 37 weeks is considered full term, but it's still a bit early. Newborns, even full-term, can be vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real concern, especially for infants. Parents often take precautions to protect their babies from germs, which is common practice. The message the author sent was polite and explained the reasons, so it's not like they were being rude or dismissive. They even invited the family to hang out with the baby, just not pass him around. \n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not attend Christmas over this seems like an overreaction. Parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health. The family might be used to more open interactions with babies, but the author's priorities are the baby's well-being. It's possible the family didn't take the explanation well or felt slighted, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The key points are the health concern and the clear communication. The author isn't being selfish; they're being cautious. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
