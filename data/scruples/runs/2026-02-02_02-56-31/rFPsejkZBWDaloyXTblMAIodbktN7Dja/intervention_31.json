We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby is at 37 weeks, which is considered preterm, but not extremely early. The user sent a message explaining their decision to avoid passing the baby around during Christmas due to flu season and over-stimulation. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A 37-week baby is still a preterm infant, so they might be more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a valid concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months old. Also, handling a newborn too soon can be risky if the baby hasn't fully developed their immune system. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's family might feel hurt or excluded. The user's message might have been perceived as dismissive or not welcoming. The key here is whether the explanation provided by the user was clear and respectful. They mentioned wanting to keep the baby safe and not being overstimulated, which are reasonable reasons. However, the family's reaction is extreme\u2014threatening to not come to Christmas seems like an overreaction to a precautionary measure.\n\nI should evaluate if the user acted appropriately. Setting boundaries for the baby's health is important. The user didn't say to not come over, just not to pass the baby around. They still invite the family to hang out. The family's response seems disproportionate. The user's main goal was to protect the baby, which is a parent's priority. \n\nPossible alternative perspectives: Maybe the family was expecting more flexibility or didn't realize the baby's vulnerability. But the user did explain their reasons in advance. The message was polite and offered an alternative. \n\nSo, the user is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
