We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born 37 weeks, just three weeks early. They texted the family beforehand to explain their decision, but it caused a big conflict, even leading to being told not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term in some places but still early enough that the parents might be cautious. The parents wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu exposure, so they didn't let family pass the baby around. The family took offense and now there's a threat about Christmas.\n\nNow, thinking about cultural norms. In many cultures, especially in Western ones, it's common for new parents to be cautious with their newborns, especially if they're not fully term. However, family expectations might vary. The parents communicated their decision in advance, which is good, but maybe their explanation wasn't enough or the family felt disrespected.\n\nThe user's text is polite, mentioning they hope the family understands and invites them to hang out. So, the problem isn't the message content but possibly the family's reaction. New parents often have valid reasons for being cautious, especially with health concerns like flu season. On the other hand, family might feel excluded or disrespected, thinking the parents are treating them like a threat.\n\nLegally or medically, 37 weeks is still considered full term in some contexts, but others might consider it late preterm. The parents' caution might be justified, given that even a few weeks early can affect a baby's health. The main issue here is the family's reaction, which seems overly harsh. Threatening to exclude them from Christmas seems like a disproportionate response.\n\nSo, the parents are acting in their baby's best interest. They communicated their decision, so they aren't being inconsiderate. The family's response is more about their own feelings being hurt rather than the parents' actions being wrong. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
