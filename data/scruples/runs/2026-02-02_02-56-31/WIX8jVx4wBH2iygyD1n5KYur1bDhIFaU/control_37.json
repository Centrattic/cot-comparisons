One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The key points are:\n\n1. The author had a friend, Annie, over for drinks before a party. They ended up in his room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't there at the time.\n2. The girlfriend found out later and was upset about the sleepover and previous incidents where Annie might have been too close (like holding hands at a festival). The author hadn't noticed these things bothered her.\n3. The girlfriend also mentioned a past conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the author had mentioned Annie. The girlfriend feels this made the situation more sensitive.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. Even though the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, not checking in with his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a misstep. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt hurt and there was a lack of consideration for her perspective. The fact that they had joked about threesomes involving the same friend might have added to her insecurity. However, the author didn't act with malice. It's more about not being aware of how his actions affected his girlfriend. In relationships, even if unintentional, actions can have emotional consequences. So, while the author isn't necessarily malicious, he might be at fault for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not being proactive in communication. The answer is A (yes), but it's a bit nuanced. Wait, the options are A for yes (author wrong) and B for no. Given that he didn't intend harm but failed to consider her feelings, maybe A is correct. But some might argue he's not wrong because he didn't act with intent. Hmm. The site usually leans towards A if the person could have done better. Since he didn't ask his GF and it upset her, even if unintentional, he's partly at fault. So answer A.\n"
