One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The title says he's the one asking if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the situation: the author, a 21-year-old guy, had his friend Annie (22F) over after a friend bailed on a party. They ended up watching TV in his room, smoked some joints, and fell asleep together. His girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and went back to her place. He told her the next day, and she was upset a few days later when they met again. She felt it was inappropriate, especially because there was a past conversation where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie. She also brought up other instances where Annie was close to the author, like holding hands at a festival. The author didn't think much of it but now feels guilty and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. The key points are the sleepover in his room, not telling his girlfriend, and the previous joke about threesomes. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a breach of trust. Even if it was innocent, not discussing it with her might make her feel insecure or neglected. The fact that they had a previous conversation about threesomes and he mentioned Annie could add to her feelings of being disregarded, even if it was just a joke. \n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover. Annie fell asleep there after they both decided not to go to the party. The author didn't mean to overstep, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's upset about the lack of communication and the past comments. She might feel that the author didn't take her feelings into account.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have ulterior motives. He didn't do anything to intentionally hurt his girlfriend. But the act of not telling her and the previous joke about threesomes could be seen as negligent of her feelings. The author is now aware and is trying to adjust his behavior, which is positive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the girlfriend feels hurt and the author didn't communicate properly, then he might share some responsibility. But if the girlfriend overreacted, maybe she's part of the problem. However, in most relationship contexts, not being transparent can be seen as a mistake, even if unintentional. The author should have discussed the situation with his girlfriend beforehand to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, the author might be at least partially at fault.\n"
