One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with their male friend (21M) and female friend Annie (22F), who is in a long-term relationship. The author's girlfriend (20F) found out and was upset, even though the author didn't initiate anything and thought it was fine. The key points here are about the author's actions and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Annie came over for drinks before a party. They ended up not going to the party, watched TV, smoked weed, and fell asleep together in the author's room. The author didn't think to ask their girlfriend about it. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next day, the author told her, and initially didn't realize the issue. Then, when the girlfriend confronted him, she mentioned past instances where Annie had crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The author hadn't noticed these things bothered her, but he admitted to saying Annie's name in a hypothetical threesome conversation, which is probably why the girlfriend is more upset now.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did something wrong. From a relationship perspective, even if the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, the fact that Annie is in a relationship and they ended up in bed together (sleeping) could be seen as problematic. The girlfriend might feel that the author didn't respect her feelings by not considering how the sleepover would affect her. Also, the past comments about a threesome involving Annie might have made the girlfriend feel those lines were being blurred, even if it was just a hypothetical. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't initiate the situation and didn't see it as a big deal. However, being in a relationship often requires communication and consideration of the partner's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt uncomfortable, and the author might have been oblivious to her boundaries. The mention of the past hypothetical threesome could be a red flag, even if it was meant as a joke, because it might imply a level of comfort with Annie that the girlfriend doesn't feel secure about.\n\nIn terms of the friend's perspective, Annie is in a long-term relationship herself, so the author might be in the wrong for allowing a situation where a friend in a relationship is in his bed without considering the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's anger is partly due to the fact that the author didn't ask her and didn't notice her discomfort before. The author now fears that being hyper-aware will affect their friendship with Annie, but maybe the issue is more about the relationship dynamics between the author and his girlfriend.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate with their girlfriend about the sleepover, didn't consider her feelings, and the past comments about threesomes could have contributed to the girlfriend's insecurity. Even if no physical interaction happened, the situation is potentially sensitive in a relationship. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
