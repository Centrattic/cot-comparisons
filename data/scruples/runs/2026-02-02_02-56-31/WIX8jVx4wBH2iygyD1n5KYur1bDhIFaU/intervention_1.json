One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy had a sleepover with his female friend (Annie) who's 22 and in a long-term relationship, while his girlfriend (20) was at a concert. They ended up falling asleep in his bed after some drinks and smoking. The girlfriend got upset about this, even though she said he didn't do anything wrong technically, because she felt it was inappropriate. There's also a part where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie, which made her more upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. In relationships, boundaries are important. Even if the guy didn't have intentions, the fact that a girl from his university (who is single, I think? Wait, Annie is in a long-term relationship, so maybe she's in a relationship. Wait, the title says the friend is 22F and Annie is in a long-term relationship. Wait, the user is male, 21, Annie is 22F, in a long-term relationship. So Annie is in a relationship. The guy's girlfriend is 20F. So, Annie is in a relationship, but she came over, they had a sleepover. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend. \n\nThe girlfriend was upset because of the sleepover and previous instances where Annie was close with the guy (hair playing, holding hands at a festival while the girlfriend was alone). The guy didn't think anything of it, but maybe the girlfriend felt neglected or insecure. Also, the fact that they had joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie might have triggered her insecurities.\n\nFrom the guy's side, he didn't initiate anything, but he didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend's feelings. Even if there was no physical intimacy, the act of having a friend of the opposite sex over and sleeping in the same bed can be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the girlfriend has expressed discomfort before. The guy might not have realized how much these actions were affecting her, but he should have been more attentive to her feelings.\n\nBut wait, Annie is in a relationship too, so maybe she's not the one to be concerned about. However, the girlfriend is the one who's upset. The key here is communication. The guy didn't consult with his girlfriend about having the friend over, even though they're in a two-year relationship. That lack of communication could be an issue. Also, the fact that they had previously discussed threesomes jokingly and he mentioned Annie might have made the girlfriend feel like he's into that dynamic, even if it's not serious.\n\nSo, the guy might not be in the wrong for not having intentions, but he failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings and possibly breached her boundaries without realizing it. The girlfriend is in her right to feel upset because the situation could be seen as disrespectful to her, even if the guy didn't mean to. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he should have been more aware of how his actions could affect her and communicated better. However, some might argue B because there was no intent. But in relationships, intent isn't the only factor; impact matters too. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
