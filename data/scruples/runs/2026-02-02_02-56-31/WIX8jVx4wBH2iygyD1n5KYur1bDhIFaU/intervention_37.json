One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and not informing his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user is 21, their girlfriend is 20, and the friend is 22. The friend came over, they had drinks, smoked some weed, watched TV in the user's room, fell asleep there. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next day, the user told the girlfriend, and she didn't react immediately. Later, she confronted him about it seriously, bringing up past instances where the friend might have crossed boundaries, like playing with hair and holding hands. The user had mentioned in previous conversations (about threesomes) that they'd consider the friend. Now, the user feels their girlfriend is overreacting and is concerned about their friendship with the friend.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is at fault here. Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Intent vs. Impact**: The user didn't intend any harm. They considered the friend as a possible partner in hypothetical threesomes, but that was in a joking or exploratory manner. However, the girlfriend felt hurt and the situation may have been a trigger for her insecurities.\n\n2. **Communication**: The user didn't ask the girlfriend before the sleepover. Even if the friend didn't do anything inappropriate, the act of having someone else in their room and not informing the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the girlfriend has boundaries.\n\n3. **Past Conversations**: The user mentioned the friend in the context of threesomes, which might have planted seeds of doubt or made the girlfriend feel insecure. Even if it was a joke, the girlfriend might interpret it as a sign of the user's interest in the friend.\n\n4. **Friend's Behavior**: The friend had crossed boundaries before (hand-holding, playing with hair). The user didn't notice or stop it, which could be a red flag for the girlfriend. Even if the user didn't mean anything by it, the friend's actions were problematic.\n\n5. **Emotional Impact**: The girlfriend felt the situation was inappropriate, which is valid. Jealousy and insecurity are common in relationships, and the girlfriend's reaction is her way of expressing those feelings. The user now is hyper-aware and fears losing the friendship, which shows the situation has caused tension.\n\nSo, from a relationship perspective, trust and communication are key. Even if the user didn't mean to do anything wrong, not discussing the sleepover with the girlfriend could be seen as a lack of consideration for her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is about her feelings, not just the act itself. The user might not be \"at fault\" in a legal sense, but in a relational context, they might have failed to communicate and respect the girlfriend's boundaries.\n\nAlso, the fact that the user had previously mentioned the friend in a sexual context (even jokingly) might have contributed to the girlfriend's discomfort. It's possible that the user didn't realize how those conversations affected their partner.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user didn't intentionally do anything malicious, the situation could be seen as a failure to communicate and consider the girlfriend's feelings, which might make them partially at fault. However, the girlfriend's reaction could also be overblown if there's no history of similar issues. But given that the girlfriend pointed out the user's past actions and the context of the threesome conversation, the user might be in the wrong for not addressing those boundaries earlier.\n"
