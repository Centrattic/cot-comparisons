One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for a situation involving their girlfriend and a friend. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The author had a friend (Annie) stay over in their room after they both bailed on a party. They watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes involving Annie. Now the author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about their friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the key points here. Did the author do something wrong? Let's consider the girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend is upset not just about the sleepover but also about Annie's other behaviors\u2014like playing with the author's hair and holding hands at a festival. She connects this to the previous joke about threesomes, which might have made her feel insecure. The author didn't initiate any of these interactions but didn't notice the girlfriend's discomfort either. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. They thought the sleepover was innocent. However, relationships require communication and awareness of each other's feelings. Even if the author didn't do anything on purpose, not recognizing the girlfriend's discomfort and the potential for jealousy could be a misstep. Also, the fact that they had previously joked about threesomes involving Annie might have blurred the lines for the girlfriend, making her more sensitive to Annie's presence.\n\nThe author's argument is that the girlfriend overreacted. But the girlfriend's reaction is based on her feelings and past conversations, which the author might not have fully considered. The author's responsibility here is to acknowledge her feelings and work on improving communication rather than dismissing her as overreacting.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in terms of actions (no physical infidelity), but they may have failed in communication and emotional awareness. The answer hinges on whether emotional neglect counts as being in the wrong. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer is about intent vs. impact, the answer might lean towards B (No), but there's a gray area. However, given the typical AITA framework, if the author didn't act with malicious intent, they might not be in the wrong. But the girlfriend's valid feelings about the situation and the author's failure to notice them could mean the author shares some responsibility in the emotional neglect. But the question is about the author's actions, not their emotional intelligence. So, technically, since no rules were broken, maybe B is correct. However, the author's failure to consider the girlfriend's perspective could be a point.\n"
