One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for a sleepover with a friend that their girlfriend found upsetting. \n\nFirst, the situation: The user's friend, Annie, came over for drinks, they ended up not going to a party, watched TV in the user's room, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The user didn't mention this until the next day. The girlfriend was upset about the sleepover and other past interactions where Annie touched the user in ways that made her uncomfortable. She also mentioned a prior conversation where the user joked about Annie in the context of threesomes. \n\nThe user feels the girlfriend overreacted. They mention that they didn't initiate any of the situations and didn't mean to hurt her. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: She's in a 2-year relationship, and her main issue is the sleepover and the prior jokes about threesomes. Even if the user didn't mean anything by the sleepover, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. Trust and communication are big in relationships. The user didn't consider how the sleepover might affect the girlfriend's feelings, especially since they had discussed boundaries before (the threesome joke). \n\nThe user didn't inform the girlfriend beforehand, which could be seen as a lack of consideration. Even if the actions were innocent, the girlfriend's feelings matter. The user should have thought about how the sleepover might be perceived and maybe discussed it with the girlfriend first.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't initiate the sleepover, and the situations described (Annie's actions) might have been innocent. The girlfriend is bringing up past issues, which might indicate there were previous red flags. However, the user's responsibility is to be aware of their partner's feelings and ensure they don't inadvertently hurt them, especially after having discussed boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are communication and the girlfriend's emotional response. The user might not have intended harm, but the action still caused distress. In relationships, actions can have emotional impacts that need to be respected and communicated about. The user's failure to consider the girlfriend's feelings and prior discussion about boundaries could make them at least partially responsible, even if they didn't mean to do anything wrong.\n"
