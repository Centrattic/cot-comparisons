One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing their girlfriend. The situation is that their friend Annie came over, they ended up in bed together after a few drinks and some weed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because of past comments about threesomes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's feelings. Trust is a big part of any relationship. Even if nothing happened, the fact that the friend was in the same bed could be seen as a breach of trust. The user didn't think to inform his girlfriend, which might make her feel left out or not respected.\n\nThen there's the history of joking about threesomes and mentioning Annie. Even if it's just playful talk, bringing that up later could make the girlfriend feel like the user is actually considering it, which adds to her insecurity. The user's friend Annie had crossed boundaries before, like holding hands and playing with hair while the girlfriend was nearby. The user didn't notice these things, which shows a lack of awareness of how their actions affected their girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't initiate the sleepover. They were hanging out, got distracted, and fell asleep. They didn't have any intention of being inappropriate. The problem might lie more in communication. The user didn't think to check in with their girlfriend about boundaries regarding friends, especially in situations like this. Also, not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a lack of transparency.\n\nBut is the user actually at fault? They didn't do anything intentionally wrong. However, their lack of awareness of the girlfriend's feelings and not setting clear boundaries with Annie might contribute to the girlfriend's anxiety. The user's friend Annie's behavior, combined with the user's past comments, even if joking, could have made the girlfriend feel insecure. The user's reaction of feeling hyper-aware and fearing the friendship's end shows they care about both their girlfriend and Annie, but maybe they need to better navigate the situation by communicating more clearly with their girlfriend about boundaries.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It's a bit of both. They didn't mean harm, but they didn't consider their girlfriend's perspective enough. The answer might be a mix, but according to the options, it's either A or B. Since the user didn't intend to do anything wrong, but the situation could have been handled better with communication, maybe B is the answer. But the girlfriend's valid feelings about trust and boundaries might mean the user is partially at fault. Hmm.\n"
