One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, and didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, especially because there was a previous conversation where they joked about possible threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Now, the author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, and even though the author didn't initiate the interaction with Annie, the fact that Annie was in his bed and there were prior jokes about threesomes with her might have made her feel insecure. Trust and communication are crucial in relationships. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of consideration for her feelings, even if it was unintentional.\n\nThen there's the part about Annie crossing boundaries before\u2014like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The author didn't notice this bothered his girlfriend, which might indicate he wasn't fully aware of how his actions affected her. The girlfriend's reaction might not just be about the sleepover but the accumulation of these incidents, especially since they had discussed threesomes jokingly. This could have made her feel that the author isn't fully committed to their relationship's exclusivity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend and has been with Annie for a long time as a friend. However, in relationships, it's important to be mindful of the partner's feelings and boundaries. The fact that the girlfriend explained her side and the author now feels hyper-aware suggests that there's a need for more communication and setting boundaries between the author and Annie to prevent misunderstandings.\n\nSo, while the author might not have had malicious intent, not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the prior context (joking about threesomes with Annie) could mean he's partially at fault for not being more attentive to her potential insecurities. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), but I need to check if the key points support that.\n"
