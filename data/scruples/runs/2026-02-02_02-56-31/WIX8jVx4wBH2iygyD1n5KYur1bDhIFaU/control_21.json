One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy (21M) who had a sleepover with his female friend (22F, Annie) in his bed while his girlfriend (20F) was at a concert. He didn't inform his girlfriend, and she found out later, which led to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for allowing Annie to sleep in his bed without informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and brought up past instances where Annie's actions made her uncomfortable, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. Additionally, there was a conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend thinks contributed to her feeling.\n\nThe author claims he didn't initiate anything with Annie and that they just fell asleep. He also says he didn't notice her discomfort before. The question is whether his actions were wrong, especially in the context of his relationship with his girlfriend.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. Even if he didn't do anything wrong in his eyes, not communicating with his girlfriend about a friend sleeping in his bed might be a red flag for her. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her feelings of jealousy and insecurity, which are valid emotions in a relationship.\n\nHowever, the author didn't have any intention of being disrespectful to his girlfriend. He was with Annie for a social event, and they ended up staying in his room by accident. The fact that they fell asleep without any sexual activity might mitigate the situation, but it's still about how his girlfriend perceives it.\n\nThe mention of the previous conversations about threesomes could also play a role. Even if it was a joke, bringing up Annie in that context might have made the girlfriend feel insecure. The author's hyper-awareness now suggests he's trying to be more considerate, but the initial lack of communication is a problem.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? He didn't do anything physically wrong, but he failed to communicate with his girlfriend, which is a common issue in relationships. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, so he might be at fault for not being more mindful of her feelings and setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
