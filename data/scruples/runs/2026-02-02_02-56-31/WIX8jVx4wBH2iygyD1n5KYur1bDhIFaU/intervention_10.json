One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after a situation where their friend, Annie, slept over in their bed while their girlfriend was out. The girlfriend got upset about it. Hmm. First, I need to break down the details.\n\nThe situation: The user is 21M, their friend Annie is 22F and in a long-term relationship. The girlfriend is 20F. They had a sleepover, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was affectionate, like holding hands or playing with hair, which the user didn't see as an issue. Also, the user had jokingly mentioned Annie in the context of hypothetical threesomes.\n\nSo, the user's question is whether they did something wrong by not considering the girlfriend's feelings beforehand. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate because of the close proximity and past interactions. The user didn't intentionally do anything wrong but didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective. \n\nNow, the key points here. The user and the friend fell asleep in the same bed. Even if it was innocent, the girlfriend might feel insecure or that boundaries were crossed. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly might have added to her discomfort, making her think that the user is open to such possibilities, which she might not be okay with. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is crucial. The user didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings when they had the sleepover. Even if the intention was just to spend time with a friend, the girlfriend might feel neglected or that the user is too close to someone else. The past behavior with Annie (holding hands, etc.) could have been red flags that the user overlooked. \n\nThe user argues that they didn't do anything wrong because they didn't initiate it and meant nothing by the interactions. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Even if the user didn't have ill intentions, the actions could be seen as crossing boundaries. The user's hyper-awareness now shows that they understand the potential impact, even if they didn't realize it before.\n\nIn terms of fault, the user wasn't malicious, but they didn't consider their girlfriend's perspective. That lack of consideration could be seen as a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction, while possibly intense, is rooted in her feelings about boundaries and the previous joking about threesomes. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They didn't do anything intentionally harmful, but they didn't think about how their actions might affect their girlfriend. In relationships, being mindful of each other's feelings is important. The user's actions, while innocent, might have been insensitive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance. However, the girlfriend might have overreacted if there's no history of jealousy or if the user's actions were truly innocent. \n\nWait, but the user had already mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes, which could have planted seeds of doubt. Even if it was a joke, that might have contributed to the girlfriend's insecurity. So, the user's past comments combined with the sleepover created a situation where the girlfriend felt her boundaries were disrespected. \n\nIn conclusion, the user might not be entirely wrong, but they did make a mistake by not considering their girlfriend's feelings and past experiences. The answer would depend on whether the user should have known better. Since they had discussed threesomes and Annie's behavior, they should have been more cautious. So, Answer A (Yes, I'm wrong) is more appropriate.\n"
