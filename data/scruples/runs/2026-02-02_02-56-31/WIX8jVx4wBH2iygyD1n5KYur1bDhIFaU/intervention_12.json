One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend when their girlfriend found out. The girlfriend is upset, even though the user didn't do anything intentionally wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The user's friend Annie came over, they had drinks, watched TV in his room, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over. The user told her the next day, but she was upset about the sleepover and other past incidents where Annie touched the user. The user had previously mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome conversation, which the girlfriend points out as a reason for her hurt feelings.\n\nNow, considering the user's perspective: They didn't intend to cross any boundaries. They thought the sleepover was innocent. The girlfriend is upset because of past behavior she found inappropriate, and the user didn't realize it bothered her. The user is now anxious about their friendship with Annie.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The girlfriend felt that the user was unaware of her discomfort with Annie's actions. Even if the user didn't mean anything by it, the girlfriend is in a relationship and expects the user to be considerate of her feelings. The mention of Annie in a hypothetical threesome might have made the girlfriend feel like the user had a particular interest in her, which could explain her reaction. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are crucial. The user didn't ask the girlfriend about the sleepover, which might have been a mistake. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt the boundaries were crossed. The user's lack of awareness about Annie's previous actions (like holding hands) shows a lack of attention to the girlfriend's possible discomfort.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the user didn't act with malice, but they didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective and boundaries as much as they should have. It's about being considerate in a relationship. So, even though the user didn't do anything intentionally wrong, their negligence in considering their girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, Answer A (Yes) might be appropriate because the user could have communicated better and been more mindful of their partner's feelings.\n"
