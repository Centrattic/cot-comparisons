One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room after some drinks and a party. His girlfriend found out and got upset. The key points here are the context and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the guy mentions that Annie is in a long-term relationship, so maybe that's a factor. They were at his place, watching TV, smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. He told her the next day, but didn't think much of it. The girlfriend was upset because she felt Annie had crossed boundaries before, like playing with his hair and holding his hand when she was walking alone. \n\nThe girlfriend also mentioned a past conversation where they jokingly discussed possible threesomes, and he mentioned Annie. That's probably what made this incident more problematic for her. The guy didn't initiate the sleepover, but he also didn't notice her discomfort before. Now he's worried about his friendship with Annie because he's hyper-aware.\n\nSo, the question is: is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. From the girlfriend's point of view, even if the guy didn't do anything intentionally, the act of having a friend sleep in his bed after they had discussed possible threesomes might feel like a breach of trust. Even if it was just a sleepover, the context of previous boundaries and the past joke about threesomes could make her feel insecure. The guy didn't consider her feelings enough when Annie was around, not just in the sleepover but also in those previous instances where Annie held his hand and played with his hair. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy didn't do anything intentional. He thought the past discussions about threesomes were just jokes, and the sleepover was accidental. He didn't ask Annie to come over, and they fell asleep together unintentionally. However, sometimes being unaware of how your actions affect a partner can still be a problem. The fact that the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and that he didn't notice her discomfort before might mean he was negligent in being considerate of her feelings.\n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. It depends on whether the guy should have been more aware of his girlfriend's boundaries, even if he didn't mean to cross them. Since he was in a relationship and had discussed such topics, he might be expected to be more cautious about his interactions with friends to avoid hurting his partner's feelings. Therefore, he might share some responsibility for not being more considerate, even if he didn't do anything deliberately wrong. \n\nBut if the actions were truly unintentional and the girlfriend is overreacting, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the fact that the girlfriend felt it was a big issue means that he should have been more attentive to her feelings. So, there's a case for both sides. But in relationships, it's important to consider how your partner feels, even if you don't see an issue. So, maybe he is in the wrong for not being more considerate and for not addressing her concerns earlier.\n"
