One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend without informing their girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author (21M) had a friend, Annie (22F), over to watch TV after a friend bailed on a party. They ended up falling asleep in his room. The girlfriend (20F) was at a concert with a friend and later found out. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially because the couple had joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which is a point of contention. Even if it was accidental or innocent, not discussing it beforehand could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction stems from feeling that boundaries were crossed, particularly because of past conversations about threesomes involving Annie. \n\nThe author claims he didn't initiate any of the interactions and thought nothing of it. However, the girlfriend felt neglected and that the situation was a trigger for her insecurities. The fact that they had previously discussed threesomes (even jokingly) might have made her more sensitive to Annie's presence. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the lack of communication can lead to misunderstandings. The author didn't consider how the girlfriend might feel about Annie being in his room or the previous jokes about threesomes. \n\nAdditionally, the author now feels anxious about his friendship with Annie, which shows that his actions affected more than just the current situation. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because her feelings matter in the relationship. \n\nSo, while the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, the lack of communication and consideration for his girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, he might be at least partially at fault.\n"
