One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend in his university dorm, and his girlfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author, a guy in a 2-year relationship, had his friend (a girl in a relationship) come over to drink and then they fell asleep in his bed. His girlfriend found out, got upset, and mentioned past instances where the friend might have overstepped. The author says he didn't do anything wrong but feels his girlfriend overreacted.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend is upset because her partner had his friend sleep in his bed, and there's a history of discussions about possible threesomes, where the author mentioned the friend. The girlfriend is feeling insecure or jealous because of this.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he didn't mean anything by it and thought it was just a friendly sleepover. He also mentions that he didn't initiate any of the interactions that his girlfriend pointed out, like the friend holding his hand. However, he didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and awareness in a relationship. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not being aware of how his actions impact his girlfriend's feelings could be a problem. The girlfriend brought up things he hadn't noticed, which suggests that he might not have been as attentive to her perspective as he should be.\n\nAlso, the fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly and he mentioned the friend in that context might have planted seeds of insecurity in his girlfriend. Even if it was a joke, it's important to consider how such discussions might affect a partner's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be seen as over-the-top if the author had no intention of being unfaithful or making his girlfriend feel insecure. But in relationships, perceptions and feelings matter a lot. The author's failure to notice her discomfort could indicate a lack of emotional awareness.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If being inconsiderate of a partner's feelings is considered wrong, then yes. But if the intention was innocent and the girlfriend is overreacting, then maybe not. However, in relationship advice, it's often emphasized that actions should consider the partner's feelings, even if the intent is good.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't consider how his actions and past comments could affect his girlfriend's sense of security, even if he didn't mean harm.\n"
