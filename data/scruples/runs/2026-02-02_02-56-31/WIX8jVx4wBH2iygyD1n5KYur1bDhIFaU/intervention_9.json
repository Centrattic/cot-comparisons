  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for a situation involving their girlfriend and a female friend. The key points are:\n\n1. The user had a friend, Annie, sleep over in their room after a party fell through. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about potential threesomes and the user mentioned Annie.\n\n2. The user didn't think it was a big deal initially but now feels the girlfriend overreacted. The user is worried about their friendship with Annie because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user and Annie were friends, and they had a sleepover. The fact that they fell asleep in the same bed might be a red flag for the girlfriend, especially if there's a history of discussing boundaries. The girlfriend brought up past instances where Annie held hands or played with hair, which the user didn't see as issues. The user's girlfriend might feel those actions were crossing boundaries, especially since they had joked about threesomes and the user named Annie. That context is important because it could make the girlfriend feel insecure.\n\nThe user didn't initiate the sleepover but also didn't consult their girlfriend. Even if it was accidental, not discussing it with his girlfriend first could be a problem. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling her boundaries were ignored. The user's lack of awareness about Annie's actions in the past might indicate they were too dismissive of her feelings.\n\nHowever, the user didn't intend anything inappropriate. The main issue here is communication. The user didn't consider how his actions might affect the girlfriend, even if it was unintentional. The girlfriend's sensitivity to the situation, given the previous conversation about threesomes, makes her reaction a valid concern about trust and boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, even if actions are innocent, the perception and the impact on the partner matter. The user needs to recognize that their girlfriend's feelings are valid, even if they didn't mean anything by it. The fact that they didn't notice the previous boundary crossings suggests they might have been inconsiderate of her perspective. So, while the user might not be \"at fault\" in a malicious sense, they are in the wrong for not considering their girlfriend's feelings and boundaries, especially given the prior context.\n"
