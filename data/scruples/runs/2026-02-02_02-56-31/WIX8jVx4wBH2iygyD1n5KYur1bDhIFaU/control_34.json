One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is at fault. The scenario involves a guy who had a friend sleep over in his bed without asking his girlfriend. The girlfriend later confronted him because she felt it was inappropriate, especially after previous instances where the friend crossed boundaries, and there was a prior joke about threesomes involving that friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy didn't do anything intentionally to cross boundaries, but he didn't check in with his girlfriend beforehand. The girlfriend was upset not just about the sleepover but also because of past behaviors she found uncomfortable. The friend had previously touched him in ways she found overstepping when she was nearby. Plus, there was a joke about threesomes where he mentioned the friend, which adds to her feelings of insecurity.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. Even if the actions themselves weren't malicious, not discussing with his girlfriend beforehand could be a breach of trust or boundary-setting. The girlfriend had valid reasons to feel insecure, given the prior incidents and the joke. So, while he might not have intended harm, his lack of communication and awareness of her feelings could make him at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as overreacting if the actions were innocent. But considering the context of previous issues, her reaction might be justified. The fact that he didn't notice her discomfort before and only realized later might mean he wasn't attuned to her feelings enough, which is a responsibility in a relationship. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author might be in the wrong for not being proactive in communication and for not being more aware of his girlfriend's feelings, even if his intentions were innocent. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
