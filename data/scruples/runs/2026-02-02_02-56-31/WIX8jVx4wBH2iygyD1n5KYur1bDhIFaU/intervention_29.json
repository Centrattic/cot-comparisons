One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their friend Annie and not informing their girlfriend. So, the situation is that Annie came over to their room, they had drinks, smoked, watched TV, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend was at a concert and wasn't there. The next day, the user told the girlfriend, but she was upset because she felt it was inappropriate and mentioned other instances where Annie might have overstepped boundaries. The user admitted that they hadn't done anything intentional, but their girlfriend was hurt, especially because earlier they had joked about threesomes and the user had mentioned Annie. Now the user is conflicted between their friendship with Annie and their girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user and Annie ended up sleeping in the same bed without the girlfriend's knowledge. Even though they didn't plan it, sharing a bed with a friend, especially when the girlfriend isn't aware, can be seen as crossing a boundary. The girlfriend's discomfort comes from not being informed and previous instances where Annie's actions might have been overstepping. The user's mention of Annie in the context of threesomes, even in jest, might have contributed to the girlfriend's feelings of being disregarded.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if the user didn't intend to do anything wrong, not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a lack of communication. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid because she felt her boundaries were not respected. The user's argument is that they didn't act with ill intent and that the situation was accidental, but the girlfriend's perspective is that the lack of communication and the prior comments about threesomes made her feel insecure.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't have malicious intent and the sleepover was a result of a friend bailing. They did inform the girlfriend the next day, which shows they didn't keep it a secret. However, the fact that they had previously discussed threesomes involving Annie might have made the girlfriend more sensitive to the situation, even if the user didn't mean anything by it.\n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. The user might not be entirely in the wrong, but they did something that upset their girlfriend. The key here is communication and understanding the girlfriend's feelings. The user needs to consider how their actions, even if unintentional, affected their partner's emotions. The answer might hinge on whether the user should have been more aware of the girlfriend's feelings and preemptively communicated with her about the sleepover, especially given the previous context of discussing threesomes with Annie.\n"
