  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a guy in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. He had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who's in a long-term relationship too. They ended up falling asleep in his bed after some drinks and a couple of joints. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and the user mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the sleepover itself. While both the user and Annie were in their own relationships, the fact that they fell asleep in the same bed could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if there was no intention. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, and that's valid. She mentioned other instances where Annie had crossed boundaries before, like playing with hair and holding hands. The user didn't realize these things bothered her, which shows a lack of awareness of her feelings. \n\nThe key point is the girlfriend's perspective. Even if the user didn't do anything wrong on purpose, not considering how his actions affected her is a problem. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding of each other's boundaries. By not checking in with his girlfriend before the sleepover, he might have ignored her feelings. Also, the previous conversation about threesomes and mentioning Annie definitely contributed to her feeling that the situation was a breach of trust. \n\nThe user now feels guilty and is worried about his friendship with Annie, but his girlfriend's feelings were valid. He should have been more considerate of her feelings from the start. The fact that he didn't notice her discomfort before shows a lack of attention to her needs, which is a mistake in the relationship. So, the answer would be A because he's in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries and not being aware of her feelings.\n"
