One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did something wrong by having their friend stay over in their bed without informing their girlfriend. The situation involves a few key points.\n\nFirst, the friend in question is a guy, but the user mentions Annie is 22F. Wait, the user is 21M, Annie is 22F, and the girlfriend is 20F. So the friend is female. They had a sleepover where they fell asleep together in the user's room. The girlfriend found out and was upset, partly because of a past conversation where they jokingly discussed threesomes and the user had mentioned Annie.\n\nThe user thinks maybe the girlfriend overreacted. The key here is whether the user did something wrong. The main issue is about boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend felt uncomfortable because of the friend's presence in the bed, even if it was unintentional. The user didn't inform the girlfriend, which might have been a mistake because transparency is important in relationships. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries (like holding hands at a festival), which the user didn't notice. This suggests the user might not have been aware of how their friend's actions affected their partner. \n\nThe user's argument is that they didn't intend anything wrong and that the friend sleeping over was accidental. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and not checking in with her about such a situation could be seen as neglecting her feelings. \n\nThe fact that they had a previous joke about threesomes involving Annie might have triggered the girlfriend's unease, making her more sensitive to the situation. The user's not noticing Annie's past boundary crossings could indicate a lack of awareness of how their actions impact their girlfriend.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate the situation with their girlfriend beforehand, and they didn't take into account her feelings about Annie's previous actions. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the lack of communication and awareness of the girlfriend's perspective is a problem.\n"
