One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy (21M) who had a sleepover with his female friend (22F) and didn't inform his girlfriend (20F). The girlfriend got upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and he mentioned that friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the sleepover. The friend stayed over, fell asleep in the author's bed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, bringing up past incidents where the friend had touched the author. The author didn't think it was a big deal but hadn't considered that it made his girlfriend uncomfortable. The girlfriend forgave him but the author is now conflicted about his friendship with Annie.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a breach of trust, even if he didn't have any intentions. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling insecure or not respected. The fact that they had joked about threesomes and he chose that friend adds to her feelings of betrayal.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover, and the friend was in a long-term relationship. The author's intention was just to have a friend sleep over. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt uncomfortable and the situation could be seen as crossing boundaries, even if unintentionally. The author's lack of awareness of his girlfriend's discomfort is a problem. He should have communicated better and considered her feelings more.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the actions but for not being more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings. The answer would be A (Yes) because he didn't communicate and didn't take her feelings into account, leading to the situation being blown out of proportion. Alternatively, maybe B if the girlfriend overreacted. But given the girlfriend's valid concerns and the prior jokes about threesomes, the author's lack of communication is a mistake. So the answer is A.\n"
