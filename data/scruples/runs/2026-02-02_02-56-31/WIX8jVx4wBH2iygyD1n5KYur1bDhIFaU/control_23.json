One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not asking his girlfriend about having a sleepover with his female friend. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe setup is that the author's friend, Annie, came over to his place to drink before a party. They ended up watching TV in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because there was previous talk about threesomes and the friend being flirtatious.\n\nFirst, the author didn't invite Annie over; she came by herself. He didn't initiate the sleepover. However, the fact that they were in bed together could be a red flag for the girlfriend. The girlfriend brought up past incidents where Annie was affectionate, which the author didn't notice. The main issue seems to be the lack of communication between the author and his girlfriend about boundaries with friends, especially after they had discussed threesomes jokingly.\n\nThe girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she felt the situation was inappropriate. The author didn't consider her perspective beforehand, even though they are in a two-year relationship. The key here is whether the author should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings and set boundaries with Annie. Since the author didn't ask for her opinion and the situation made her uncomfortable, even if he didn't mean anything by it, he might be in the wrong for not being considerate enough. Also, the fact that they had previously talked about threesomes (even jokingly) adds a layer where the girlfriend might feel insecure. So, the author's failure to communicate and consider her feelings could make him at fault. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But wait, the author didn't initiate the sleepover, just let it happen. Maybe he's not entirely to blame. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. But in relationships, communication is key. Since the girlfriend felt upset and the author didn't check in with her before, maybe he's at fault. So likely A.\n"
