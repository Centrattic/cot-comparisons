One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his friend Annie had a sleepover. They drank, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't realize these made her uncomfortable until she brought it up.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The girlfriend felt that the sleepover was inappropriate, especially since they had previously talked about hypothetical threesomes and the author had mentioned Annie. Even if the author didn't have any intention, the act of having Annie sleep over without informing his girlfriend might have made her feel insecure or disrespected.\n\nThe author didn't initiate the sleepover, but he also didn't check in with his girlfriend beforehand. His lack of awareness about her feelings regarding Annie's actions could be a problem. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid because the situation could be perceived as crossing boundaries, especially in a relationship context. The author's friend Annie's past behavior, like holding his hand while the girlfriend was alone, might have contributed to her anxiety.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to hurt her, he could be at fault for not being more considerate of her feelings and boundaries. The fact that they had discussed threesomes hypothetically, even jokingly, might have made her feel that the sleepover was a step towards that, which she wasn't comfortable with. The author's failure to communicate and his unawareness of her discomfort are key factors here. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and for not being more attentive to her emotional needs.\n"
