One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a friend sleep over in their bed without informing their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset because of past comments about threesomes involving that friend.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. The user's friend came over, they ended up watching TV and smoking, then fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't involved because she was at a concert. The user didn't think to mention it, which might be a problem. Even if it was accidental, in a relationship, transparency is key. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially considering past jokes about threesomes. Even if the user didn't mean anything by it, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. She brought up other instances where the friend crossed boundaries, like holding hands and playing with hair. The user not noticing these things might indicate a lack of awareness of the girlfriend's insecurities. \n\nThe user's argument is that they didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but relationships require communication and consideration of each other's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction, while maybe intense, stems from feeling disregarded. The user's subsequent hyper-awareness and fear of affecting their friendship with Annie suggest that there's a need to balance both relationships. \n\nSo, the user might not be entirely wrong, but they could have handled the situation better. However, since the girlfriend's feelings were valid and the user didn't consider her perspective, maybe they are partially at fault. But the question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" The answer hinges on whether the user's actions (even if unintentional) disregarded the girlfriend's feelings. The past comments about threesomes likely exacerbated the situation. So, the girlfriend's reaction is understandable, but the user's lack of communication might make them partially wrong. However, since the title is asking if they're in the wrong, and the girlfriend did say they didn't do anything wrong, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but with a note that communication could have been better. But given the girlfriend's valid concerns, maybe A (in the wrong) because they didn't consider her feelings enough.\n"
