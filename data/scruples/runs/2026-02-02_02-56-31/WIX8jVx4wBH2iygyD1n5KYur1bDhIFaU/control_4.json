One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, and didn't consider how his girlfriend might feel. The girlfriend was upset because the friend had crossed boundaries in the past, like playing with his hair and holding hands, which he didn't notice. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes, and he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether the author acted inappropriately by not considering his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend felt the boundaries were crossed, especially since there was a history of her being uncomfortable with Annie's behavior. The author didn't have intentions, but his lack of awareness might be the problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication and respecting boundaries are crucial. Even if the actions seem innocent, the girlfriend's perspective matters. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of consideration. The fact that he had previously mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes, even jokingly, might have contributed to her feelings of being disrespected. \n\nThe author admits he didn't notice the signs that his girlfriend was upset about Annie's behavior before. That shows a lack of attentiveness to her feelings. Even though he didn't intend to hurt her, the impact of his actions is what matters here. In many relationship advice contexts, being mindful of a partner's insecurities is important. \n\nHowever, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense. He didn't have bad intentions, but his lack of awareness and communication might have caused harm. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because her feelings are real. The question is whether the author's actions, though unintentional, were negligent.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong for not having bad intentions, but he did neglect to consider his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction is a valid expression of her discomfort. Therefore, the author's mistake was not being more communicative and aware, but not in a malicious way. So the answer might lean towards B (No), but there's a nuance here. However, in AITA terms, sometimes the perspective of the girlfriend is prioritized, so maybe A. Wait, but the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author didn't consider them, then technically he might be in the wrong for not being considerate enough. But since he didn't act with ill intent, it's complicated. In AITA threads, often the consensus is that the person isn't in the wrong if their intentions are good. So perhaps B is the answer here.\n"
