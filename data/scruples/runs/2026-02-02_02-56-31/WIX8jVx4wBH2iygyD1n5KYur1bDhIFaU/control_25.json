One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author, a male, had a sleepover with his female friend Annie. The girlfriend found out and got upset. The key points are: they had drinks, watched TV, smoked pot, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend. The author didn't tell her immediately. Then, the girlfriend brought up past instances where Annie was affectionate, which the author didn't realize were a problem. Also, there's the mention of joking about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and boundaries are important. Even if the author didn't have intentions, not informing his girlfriend about Annie sleeping over might be a breach of trust. Also, the past behavior with Annie (hand-holding, etc.) could be seen as overstepping in her eyes. The threesome joke might have added fuel to her insecurities.\n\nBut the author didn't initiate anything, which is a point in his favor. He didn't do anything wrong intentionally. However, the fact that he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover could be the issue. In relationships, communication is key. Even if the actions were innocent, not discussing it with his girlfriend might have caused unnecessary hurt.\n\nAlso, the author's friend Annie was in a long-term relationship too, so maybe there's a pattern of behavior here. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling ignored and not being considered in the author's actions. She might feel that even though he's not cheating, his actions are disrespectful to their relationship's boundaries.\n\nSo, while the author might not be at fault for the actual sleepover, the lack of communication and not considering his girlfriend's feelings could make him partially responsible. The girlfriend has a right to feel upset if she perceived the situation as a breach of trust or boundaries, even if unintended. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the communication issue, not the actions themselves.\n"
