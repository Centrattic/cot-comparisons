One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for a situation involving their girlfriend and a friend. They had a friend over, they watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out and was upset. The user says they didn't mean anything by it and thought it was fine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user and their friend were in the TV room (which is in the user's room), had drinks, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't there at the time. The user didn't ask their girlfriend beforehand, which might be a point of contention. The girlfriend was upset because of past instances where the friend might have overstepped, like holding hands or playing with hair. The user had also mentioned the friend in a hypothetical threesome scenario, which the girlfriend brings up as a reason for her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. Even if the user didn't have bad intentions, the girlfriend felt her boundaries were crossed. The user didn't consider how the situation might make his girlfriend feel, especially given the history. The fact that they had discussed hypothetical scenarios about sleeping with friends might have made the girlfriend feel like the user was being disloyal or not respecting her feelings.\n\nAlso, the user didn't think to check in with their girlfriend before having the friend over. While the friend didn't do anything intentionally to harm the relationship, the lack of communication could have been avoided. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels her concerns weren't acknowledged, even if the user didn't mean to cause harm.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider the partner's feelings and perspectives, even if the actions seem harmless. The user's friend might not have intended to overstep, but the situation and past comments contributed to the girlfriend's distress. So, the user might be in the wrong for not being more considerate of their girlfriend's feelings and for not communicating about the plans beforehand.\n"
