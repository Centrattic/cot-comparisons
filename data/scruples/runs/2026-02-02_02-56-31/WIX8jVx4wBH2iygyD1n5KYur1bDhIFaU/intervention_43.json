  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user had a sleepover with his 21-year-old male friend and a 22-year-old female friend, Annie. His girlfriend found out and got upset. The key points here are the context of the situation, the communication between the user and his girlfriend, and the history of their conversations about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that Annie came over to his place before a party, they had drinks, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend wasn't at the party because she went to a concert with a friend. The next day, he told her, and she didn't seem to mind at first. But later, when they met, she was more serious about it. She brought up past incidents where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The user didn't think those were issues, but he loves his girlfriend.\n\nThen there's the part about discussing threesomes jokingly. The user had mentioned Annie in that context, which the girlfriend now sees as a red flag. She's upset because the combination of the sleepover and the previous joking about threesomes made her feel insecure. The user is now worried about how this affects his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, the main issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. Even if the user didn't intend anything wrong, the girlfriend's feelings matter. The fact that they had joked about threesomes involving Annie might have contributed to her feeling that the sleepover crossed a line. The user didn't consult his girlfriend about having Annie over, which could be seen as a lack of communication. However, if the sleepover happened without any intent to be inappropriate, the user might not be in the wrong. But the girlfriend's perspective is valid because her feelings are hurt, and the user didn't consider how she might feel about Annie's previous actions. The user's answer should balance both perspectives: he might not be at fault for the sleepover itself, but he could have been more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings and the context of their past conversations.\n"
