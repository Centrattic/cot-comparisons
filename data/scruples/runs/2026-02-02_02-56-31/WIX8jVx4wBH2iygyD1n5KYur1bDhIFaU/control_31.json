One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, who is in a relationship. The girlfriend found out and got upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes involving that friend. The guy didn't think it was a big deal, but the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and brought up past behaviors like the friend playing with his hair and holding his hand at an event when the girlfriend was nearby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy didn't initiate the sleepover, and they were just hanging out until they fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert and not home. The guy told her the next day, but he didn't think much of it. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be that the friend crosses boundaries, and the fact that the guy had previously mentioned the friend in the context of threesomes, even if jokingly, made her more upset.\n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, communication is key. The guy might not have realized how the situation looked from his girlfriend's view. Even though he didn't do anything intentionally, the context of their previous conversations about threesomes might have made the girlfriend feel insecure. The fact that the friend is in a long-term relationship herself could also be a red flag for the girlfriend, thinking that the friend might not respect boundaries.\n\nThe guy's argument is that he didn't do anything wrong because he didn't initiate it and he loves his girlfriend. However, relationships often involve not just actions but also how those actions affect the other person's feelings. The girlfriend felt the situation was inappropriate, and even if the guy didn't mean anything by it, he should consider her feelings. Not noticing her discomfort is a sign that he might not be as attentive as he needs to be in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting, especially if the guy didn't have any intention of being unfaithful. But in relationships, trust and boundaries are important. The guy's prior comments about threesomes involving his girlfriend's close friend could have planted seeds of doubt, making her more sensitive to the situation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the guy is in the wrong. If he didn't act with malice but failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings and the potential for misunderstanding, he might not be entirely at fault. However, if his actions, even if unintentional, caused his girlfriend distress, there's a responsibility to address that and adjust behavior moving forward. The answer here would depend on balancing both perspectives, but since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the key is whether the actions were intentional or negligent.\n\nGiven that the guy didn't initiate the sleepover and it was an accidental situation, but he had previously joked about threesomes with that friend, which might have triggered the girlfriend's insecurities, he might be partially at fault for not being aware of how his words and actions could be perceived. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes), but maybe leaning towards B (No) if the actions were unintentional. However, in relationship contexts, being oblivious to a partner's feelings can still be seen as the author's fault. I need to decide based on the information given.\n"
