One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (21M) had a sleepover with his friend Annie (22F) and didn't inform his girlfriend (20F). They were at the university, and they had drinks, smoked some weed, and fell asleep together in the author's room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset because she felt it was inappropriate, especially considering past instances where Annie might have overstepped boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so she probably has certain expectations about how her partner interacts with friends, especially female friends. The fact that they ended up in the same bed without asking her could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if it was unintentional, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. She mentioned that the author had mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome conversation, which probably made her feel insecure or like he was entertaining the idea with someone else. That adds to her concern about boundaries.\n\nOn the author's side, he didn't mean any harm and thought it was innocent. He didn't initiate the sleepover, just didn't ask his girlfriend. But maybe he should have considered her feelings more. Even if the actions themselves were not malicious, not communicating with his girlfriend about such a situation is important in a committed relationship. Trust and communication are key. Also, the author is now hyper-aware of his actions around Annie, which might affect their friendship. He needs to balance his friendship with Annie and his girlfriend's comfort.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and boundaries. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, which might have been a mistake. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the girlfriend's reaction stems from feeling left out or not considered in that moment. The past conversation about threesomes might have made her more sensitive to this situation. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to be transparent about interactions with others, especially when it involves sleeping in the same room. Even if there's no malice, the girlfriend's feelings are significant. The author might not be in the wrong for the actions themselves but for not considering her feelings and not communicating. So, whether he's in the wrong could depend on the relationship's standards and how they communicate about such things. But from an outsider's view, the girlfriend's reaction is valid, and the author could be at fault for not addressing her concerns proactively.\n"
