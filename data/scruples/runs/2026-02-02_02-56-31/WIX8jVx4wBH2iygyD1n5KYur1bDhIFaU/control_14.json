One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with his female friend, who ends up in his bed, while his girlfriend isn't informed. The girlfriend gets upset because she felt this was inappropriate, especially since they had previously joked about threesomes and the friend was mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The author mentions that they had a drink, went to watch TV in his room, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't there at the time. He told her the next day but didn't think much of it. The girlfriend later expressed her feelings, pointing out other instances where the friend crossed boundaries. The key here is that the girlfriend felt uncomfortable, not because the author did something on purpose, but because he didn't notice her feelings and mentioned the friend in previous jokes about threesomes.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. Even if the author didn't intend to cause harm, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The fact that they had previously discussed threesomes and the friend in question might have amplified her reaction. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if unintentional. \n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover or have any sexual intent. He just fell asleep with a friend. The issue here is more about the girlfriend's perception and past conversations. The author's hyper-awareness now is a result of her feedback, which is a normal response. But whether he's in the wrong depends on the boundaries they have. If they hadn't discussed boundaries before, then the girlfriend's reaction is valid but the author isn't necessarily at fault. However, since they did joke about threesomes, the girlfriend's sensitivity is understandable. \n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, if one partner feels hurt and the other didn't consider their feelings, the onus is on the person to communicate better. The author could have been more aware of his girlfriend's possible discomfort, especially given their prior discussions. But since he didn't mean any harm and it was a genuine oversight, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, so the author might not be entirely in the wrong but could have handled communication better. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author didn't act with malintent, but the situation shows a lack of awareness. However, if the girlfriend's reaction is about past jokes, maybe the author should have considered that. It's a tricky balance. But given that he didn't initiate anything and it was a slip-up, the answer leans towards B. However, the girlfriend's valid feelings mean the author should have been more considerate, which might tip it towards A. But the key is the author didn't do anything intentional. So, likely B.\n"
