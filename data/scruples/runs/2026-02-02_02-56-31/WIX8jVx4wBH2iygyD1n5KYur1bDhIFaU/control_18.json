One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a guy, had his friend Annie (a girl in a relationship) over. They ended up in his room watching TV, smoking, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out and is upset. The key points are whether the author did something wrong by not considering his girlfriend's feelings, even if the act itself was innocent.\n\nFirst, the author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might be an issue. Even though they weren't at the party anymore, the fact that Annie slept in his bed could be a problem in a relationship. The girlfriend mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding hands and playing with hair. The author didn't notice these things were bothering her, which shows a lack of awareness.\n\nAlso, there's that conversation they had about threesomes where he mentioned Annie. Even if it was just hypothetical, that might have planted seeds for the girlfriend's insecurity. Now, after the incident, the author feels hyper-aware and worried about the friendship. \n\nThe girlfriend is feeling hurt because her boundaries weren't respected. Even if the author didn't do anything on purpose, not considering her feelings and the past behavior of Annie could be seen as neglecting her emotional needs. The author should have been more mindful of how his actions might affect her, especially with the history of Annie's actions. So, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but he did overlook his girlfriend's feelings. But according to the girlfriend's perspective, he should have been more aware. So it's a bit of a gray area. However, in relationships, communication is key. The author didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover, and didn't consider her past concerns. So maybe he is partially at fault for not being more considerate. But the girlfriend might also be overreacting. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's feelings are valid, even if the action was innocent, the author should have thought about her perspective. So answer A.\n"
