One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and not informing their girlfriend. The scenario involves the author's friend, Annie, staying over after a party plans fall through, and both falling asleep in the author's room. The girlfriend later confronts the author, feeling it was inappropriate, especially considering a prior joke about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the key factors here are consent and communication. The author didn't have any intention to be inappropriate, but the girlfriend felt hurt. The author didn't check in with their girlfriend beforehand, which might have been a mistake. In relationships, communication is crucial, especially regarding boundaries with friends of the opposite sex. Even if the actions were innocent, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author's lack of awareness about her discomfort is a point to consider.\n\nAlso, the mention of a previous conversation about threesomes complicates things. Even if it was in jest, the girlfriend might feel that the sleepover situation brings up those insecurities. The author's not noticing Annie's boundary-crossing behaviors (like playing with hair, holding hands) shows a possible lack of mindfulness about the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and wasn't in a physical relationship with Annie. The situation was accidental, and the author clarified they love their girlfriend. However, the problem isn't just the sleepover but the lack of communication and consideration for the girlfriend's feelings. The author should have been more attentive to her past concerns and perhaps discussed the sleepover with her, even if it seemed innocent.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for the sleepover itself, their failure to communicate and consider their girlfriend's perspective is where they might be in the wrong. The answer might lean towards A, but I need to check if the actions were indeed a mistake regardless of intent.\n"
