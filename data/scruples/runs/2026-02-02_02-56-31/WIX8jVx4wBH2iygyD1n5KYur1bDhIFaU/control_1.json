One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his female friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his friend Annie had a sleepover in his room after a night of drinking and smoking. They fell asleep together, and the author didn't mention it to his girlfriend at the time. The girlfriend later confronted him, upset about the situation and some previous boundary-crossing by Annie. The author feels his girlfriend overreacted, especially since they had joked about threesomes before, and now he's worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The girlfriend felt uncomfortable because Annie was crossing boundaries. The author didn't realize it bothered her until she pointed it out. The sleepover happened without the girlfriend's knowledge. Also, the author had previously mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes in a joking manner.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid because she felt the boundaries were being tested, especially with Annie's other actions like playing with hair and holding hands. The fact that they had discussed threesomes before, even jokingly, might have added to her insecurity.\n\nThe author's mistake might be not checking in with his girlfriend about his plans, especially something as intimate as a sleepover in his bed. Even if it was just friends hanging out, in a relationship, certain actions can be perceived as crossing lines. The girlfriend's main issue could be the lack of communication and not the act itself, especially since the author didn't initiate anything with Annie.\n\nHowever, the author didn't have malicious intent. He thought nothing of it initially. The girlfriend brought up past issues where Annie overstepped, which the author hadn't noticed. It's possible the girlfriend was already feeling insecure about Annie's behavior, and the sleepover was the last straw.\n\nBut in most relational ethics, both partners need to be on the same page about boundaries. The author might have failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings and perspectives, even if unintentionally. He didn't ask for permission or inform her, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the lack of communication can lead to mistrust.\n\nSo, while the author may not have intended harm, the act of not informing his girlfriend and the context of previous boundary issues might place some responsibility on him. Therefore, he could be at least partially in the wrong for not being transparent and not recognizing his girlfriend's concerns sooner.\n"
