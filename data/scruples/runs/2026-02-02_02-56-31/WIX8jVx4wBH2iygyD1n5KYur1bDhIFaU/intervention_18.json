  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and not informing their girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the user and their friend Annie ended up in the same bed after a night of drinking and smoking. The girlfriend found out later, and while the user didn't think much of it, the girlfriend was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. Also, there was a conversation where they joked about threesomes and the user mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend brought up as a reason for her reaction.\n\nSo, the main points are: the sleepover, past boundary issues, and the past joke about threesomes. The user didn't inform his girlfriend, and now he's worried about his friendship with Annie. The girlfriend feels it's inappropriate, but the user thinks she's overreacting.\n\nI need to determine if the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user didn't think to ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might have been a mistake. Even if the sleepover was innocent, not informing her could be a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is based on past concerns and the context of the previous joke about threesomes, which adds to her insecurity. \n\nThe user might not have intended to hurt her, but the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. The past behavior with Annie (holding hands, etc.) shows a pattern that the girlfriend found concerning. The user didn't notice these red flags before, which might be why he's in the wrong. His actions, while not malicious, contributed to the girlfriend's discomfort. Also, the fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly and he mentioned Annie could have made the situation more sensitive. \n\nSo, even if the user didn't mean to cross any lines, his lack of communication and not being aware of his girlfriend's boundaries might make him at fault. The answer might be A. But I should also consider if the girlfriend is overreacting. However, given the context, her reaction seems justified based on the cumulative issues. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not being considerate enough.\n"
