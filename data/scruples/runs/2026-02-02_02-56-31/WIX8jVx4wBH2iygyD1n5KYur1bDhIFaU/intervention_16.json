One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user had a sleepover with their friend Annie, who is 22 and in a long-term relationship, and their girlfriend found out and is upset. The user didn't inform the girlfriend beforehand, and now the girlfriend is upset about the sleepover and some past interactions between the user and Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user and Annie were hanging out, had drinks, watched TV, smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend. The user didn't think to inform the girlfriend, but when asked, he told her the next morning. The girlfriend is upset not just because of the sleepover but also because of previous instances where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival while the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there's a mention of a past conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the user mentioned Annie.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on the accumulation of these incidents. Even though the user didn't intend anything, the girlfriend feels that the sleepover combined with the previous behavior and the past joke about threesomes is problematic. Trust and communication are big parts of a relationship. The user didn't consider how his actions might make his girlfriend feel, even if he didn't mean anything by it. \n\nThe user might not have done anything malicious, but the lack of consideration for his girlfriend's feelings and the fact that he didn't check in with her could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, if they had discussed boundaries before, especially regarding friends of the opposite sex, the user might have breached those unspoken or spoken boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user and Annie are close friends and there's no indication that they have a romantic relationship, the sleepover might not be inherently wrong. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and if she's uncomfortable, the user should acknowledge her perspective. The fact that the user didn't realize how his actions affected her until she explained it suggests a communication gap in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might not be intentionally wrong, but he did overlook his girlfriend's feelings and didn't communicate properly. The answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the lack of consideration for her emotions and the failure to maintain boundaries she finds important. However, if the girlfriend's reaction is seen as overly sensitive or if there were no prior discussions about such boundaries, then maybe B (No) would be the case. But given the context, it's more about how his actions impacted her, so it's more likely A.\n"
