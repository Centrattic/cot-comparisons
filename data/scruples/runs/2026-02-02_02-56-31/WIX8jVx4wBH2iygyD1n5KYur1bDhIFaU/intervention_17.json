  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their female friend when their girlfriend wasn't there and didn't know about it. The main issue seems to be that the girlfriend was upset because of past behavior with the friend, like hand-holding and playing with hair, which the user didn't realize were making her uncomfortable. Also, there was a previous conversation where they jokingly discussed threesomes and the user mentioned the friend.\n\nFirst, the user didn't intentionally do anything wrong. They had a friend over, ended up sleeping in the same bed, and didn't inform their girlfriend. But the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially considering the past jokes about threesomes. The user didn't mean to hurt her feelings but maybe overlooked her perspective. \n\nThe key points are communication and consideration. Even if the user didn't do anything on purpose, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The user should've been more aware of how their actions might be perceived, especially since they had discussed the friend in a context that could be sensitive. The friendship with Annie might need careful handling now to avoid similar situations.\n\nSo, was the user in the wrong? They didn't act with malice, but they didn't consider their girlfriend's feelings properly. It's more about the impact of their actions rather than the intention. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they failed to communicate and consider their partner's boundaries.\n"
