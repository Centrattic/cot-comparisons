  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user had a friend, Annie, sleep over in his room after a party. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially since there was a past conversation about threesomes involving Annie. The user is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the girlfriend's perspective. Even though the user didn't intend anything inappropriate, the girlfriend felt hurt and insecure. The fact that they have discussed fantasies involving Annie in the past probably made the situation more sensitive. The user didn't ask the girlfriend about the sleepover, which might be a point of contention because communication is crucial in relationships. \n\nThe user didn't have any physical contact with Annie, but the act of sleeping in the same bed could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the girlfriend was already feeling insecure. The user's lack of awareness about Annie's previous overstepping (like holding hands) also contributed to the girlfriend's feelings of being disregarded.\n\nHowever, the user didn't initiate anything, and Annie was a close friend. The main issue here seems to be a communication breakdown. The user didn't consider how the girlfriend might feel about a friend of the opposite sex sleeping in his bed, especially after discussing threesomes with her. \n\nSo, while the user might not have intended to cause harm, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. He should have discussed the sleepover with her beforehand and been more mindful of her insecurities. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
