One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author (a guy) had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who is in a long-term relationship. His girlfriend found out and got upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie. The author is now feeling like his girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author did something wrong by having Annie stay in his bed. The girlfriend's reaction is based on past conversations where they jokingly discussed threesomes and the author mentioning Annie. Even though the author didn't initiate anything, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially considering the previous comments. \n\nSo from the author's perspective, he might not see it as wrong because he didn't do anything intentionally. He thought it was just a friend staying over after a party plan fell through. However, the girlfriend's feelings are important in the relationship. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the fact that he had talked about Annie in the context of threesomes might make the situation more sensitive. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend felt that the actions crossed a boundary she had set, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her feelings and boundaries, even if unintentionally. The key here is communication. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, which could be seen as a failure to respect her potential discomfort, especially given their past discussions. \n\nBut then again, the girlfriend is the one who brought up the issue after the fact. The author might not have known she was upset until she explained. However, even if the author didn't know, the fact that they had discussed threesomes and he mentioned Annie could imply that he was comfortable with the idea in some way, which might have set expectations that the girlfriend didn't want. \n\nIt's also about the girlfriend's feelings and how the author's actions affected her. Even if there was no intent, the outcome caused distress. So the answer might hinge on whether the author should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings, given their previous conversations. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend before the sleepover, and now the girlfriend is upset. Even if the action itself was innocent, the context of their past discussions might have made it more problematic. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and setting clear boundaries, especially given their previous talks about threesomes. But the argument could also be made that the girlfriend is overreacting. However, given the context, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing potential issues beforehand.\n"
