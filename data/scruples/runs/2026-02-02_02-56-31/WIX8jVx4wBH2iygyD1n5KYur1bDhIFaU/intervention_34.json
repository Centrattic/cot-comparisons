One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves his friend, Annie, sleeping over in his room after they watched TV and smoked. The girlfriend found out and was upset, mentioning past instances where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with his hair and holding hands.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about boundaries in a relationship. The user didn't do anything intentional, but the girlfriend feels hurt because of the sleepover and previous interactions. The user had mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome conversation, which the girlfriend brought up. \n\nNow, the girlfriend is the one who addressed the issue, so she's not happy. The user thinks she's overreacting. But in relationships, communication and respect for boundaries are important. Even if the user didn't have bad intentions, not informing the girlfriend about such a situation could be seen as a breach of trust. Also, the previous comments about the threesome involving Annie might have added to her feelings of insecurity.\n\nAnnie's actions, like holding hands with the user while the girlfriend was nearby, could be perceived as crossing boundaries. The user might not have realized how these actions affected his girlfriend. However, the user didn't initiate the sleepover, and both parties were friends. The main issue is that the user didn't check in with his girlfriend before the sleepover, leading to her feeling ignored or not respected.\n\nSo, while the user didn't act with malicious intent, the lack of communication and the girlfriend's valid concerns about Annie's behavior might mean the user is somewhat at fault. However, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as disproportionate if there's no history of similar issues. But given the context, respecting a partner's feelings and maintaining open communication is crucial. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because the user didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and didn't communicate the sleepover, which is a basic expectation in a relationship. However, the girlfriend's reaction also seems intense. But since the user didn't address her previous concerns about Annie's behavior, it's a shared issue. However, the question is about the user's responsibility. So, the answer is A.\n"
