One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a friend over, and they ended up sleeping in his bed without telling his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset about it, and now the guy is wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy's friend, Annie, came over, they didn't go to a party, ended up in his room watching TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out the next day. She was upset because of past instances where Annie might have crossed boundaries, like holding his hand or playing with his hair when she was nearby. Also, there was a conversation where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie. Now the girlfriend is upset, and the guy is feeling like she's overreacting.\n\nThe main question is whether the guy is in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, boundaries are important. Even if the guy didn't have ill intentions, the girlfriend's comfort is crucial. The fact that they ended up in the same bed could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the girlfriend wasn't informed beforehand. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about the lack of communication and past incidents rather than the actual sleepover. Also, the mention of the threesome joke might have triggered her because it tied into the current situation. \n\nEven though the guy didn't intentionally do anything wrong, not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the potential discomfort she might feel from past actions (like Annie's hand-holding) could be a point where he missed her cues. The fact that the girlfriend mentioned she didn't think he did anything wrong because he didn't initiate it, but he didn't notice her being bothered, suggests that communication was an issue. \n\nSo, while the guy might not have had malicious intent, he didn't take the time to consider his girlfriend's perspective and feelings, especially considering their previous discussions. The key here is about being aware of one's partner's feelings and respecting their boundaries, even if the actions themselves weren't malicious. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the guy being somewhat in the wrong for not being more attuned to his girlfriend's concerns.\n"
