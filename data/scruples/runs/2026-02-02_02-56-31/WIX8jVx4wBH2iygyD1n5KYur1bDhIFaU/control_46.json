One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author is a guy in a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. He had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who is in a long-term relationship. They ended up falling asleep together in his room. The girlfriend found out and was upset because of past instances where Annie had crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair or holding his hand while the girlfriend was alone nearby. Also, they had joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend might have taken into consideration.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and blowing it out of proportion. \n\nFirst, even though the author didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend, the fact that they fell asleep in the same bed could be seen as crossing a boundary. The girlfriend was upset not just about the one incident but also about previous behaviors. The author hadn't realized these actions were bothering her. Also, the mention of threesomes and choosing Annie might have added to her insecurity. \n\nRelationships require communication and awareness of each other's feelings. The author might not have done something malicious, but he failed to see how his actions affected his girlfriend. His friend Annie was in a relationship too, which might complicate things further. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as overreacting if the author had no intention of being inappropriate. However, the combination of past behaviors and the threesomes joke likely made her feel insecure. The author's lack of awareness here is a problem because even if the actions were innocent, they can be perceived as hurtful.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean anything by it, he is partially at fault for not being considerate of his girlfriend's perspective. The answer might lean towards A, but I need to check if the key factors like prior discussions and the impact on the relationship are considered. The author's justification that he didn't initiate anything doesn't absolve him from acknowledging his girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
