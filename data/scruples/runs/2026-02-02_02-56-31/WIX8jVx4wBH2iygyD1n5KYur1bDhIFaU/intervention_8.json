  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The guy is asking if he's in the wrong for having a sleepover with his friend Annie and not informing his girlfriend. They had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend, and he didn't mention it until the next day. She got upset, especially because there was a past conversation where they jokingly discussed threesomes and he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. Even if the actions themselves weren't malicious, not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, maybe because of their previous discussion about Annie. The fact that she brought up past interactions where Annie overstepped (like playing with his hair) suggests that this sleepover was the last straw for her feelings of insecurity.\n\nHe might not have done anything intentionally wrong, but the lack of communication and not considering her feelings after knowing Annie's previous behavior could make her feel neglected. The answer might depend on whether the friend was in a relationship or not. Wait, Annie is in a long-term relationship, so maybe the girlfriend felt jealous even though she knew Annie was taken. The guy didn't initiate anything, but the situation could be seen as creating a scenario that's close to cheating, hence the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nThe guy's defense is that he thought nothing of it and didn't mean anything by it. However, in a relationship, partners have different boundaries. If the girlfriend expressed discomfort about Annie before, then the guy should have been more mindful. The fact that they had discussed threesomes in a joking way might have made it more hurtful because it showed a lack of seriousness in considering her feelings.\n\nSo, while he didn't mean to hurt her, not checking in with her about the sleepover and not being aware of her past concerns could make him at fault for not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not communicating and not being attentive to her feelings.\n"
