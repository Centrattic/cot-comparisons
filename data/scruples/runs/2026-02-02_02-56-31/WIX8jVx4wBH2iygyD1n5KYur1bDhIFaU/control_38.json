One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and not informing their girlfriend. The situation involves a few key points.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Annie came over before a party, they ended up watching TV in his room, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The author didn't think much of it initially, but the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. She also brought up past instances where Annie had crossed her boundaries, like playing with his hair or holding hands at a festival. The author didn't see these as issues, but the girlfriend was upset because there was a prior conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie. Now the girlfriend is angry, and the author feels she overreacted and is worried about their friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a relationship and might feel jealous or insecure when her partner has a close friend, especially a female friend, sleeping over in the same bed. The fact that they had talked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie could exacerbate those feelings. Even if the author didn't intend anything, the act of having a friend sleep in the same bed without informing the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust or boundary. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling that the author didn't consider her feelings or the implications of their actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate anything, and Annie was in a relationship herself. The author might not have realized the potential for jealousy, especially if they've discussed casual topics like threesomes before. However, relationships require communication and respect for each other's boundaries. The author might have a point in feeling the reaction was excessive, but the act of not informing the girlfriend is a valid point of contention. The girlfriend's concern is about the cumulative effect of Annie's actions and the prior conversation, which the author didn't take into account.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author didn't act maliciously, but they failed to consider their girlfriend's feelings and the history of the situation. The girlfriend's reaction is based on valid insecurities that the author should have been more attentive to. So, the author is partially at fault for not communicating and for not being aware of how their actions affected their girlfriend. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
