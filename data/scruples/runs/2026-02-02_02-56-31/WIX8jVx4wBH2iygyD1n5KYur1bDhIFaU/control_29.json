One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend while his girlfriend was at a concert. The main points are:\n\n1. The author's friend (Annie) came over, they had a few drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The author didn't inform his girlfriend.\n2. The girlfriend later confronted him, feeling it was inappropriate and brought up past instances where Annie had touched the author in ways she found bothersome. The author didn't realize these made her uncomfortable.\n3. The key point the girlfriend mentioned was a past conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie. This seems to have triggered her feelings of betrayal.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nFirst, the act of not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover is a red flag. Even if they were just friends, not communicating such details can be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt excluded and the situation could be perceived as crossing boundaries, especially given the past joking about threesomes. The author didn't consider her feelings during these interactions, even if unintentionally.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and didn't have any physical relationship with Annie. The main issue is the lack of communication and the girlfriend feeling that her boundaries were ignored. The author's hyper-awareness now and fear for the friendship with Annie might be due to the girlfriend's valid concerns. \n\nSo, considering that communication is key in relationships and the girlfriend felt her trust was compromised, the author is somewhat in the wrong for not being transparent. But the girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by the past joke about threesomes, which adds complexity. The answer is a bit nuanced, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong due to the lack of communication and not addressing the girlfriend's feelings proactively.\n"
