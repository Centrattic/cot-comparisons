One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy having a sleepover with his 21-year-old male friend, but in the story, the friend is actually a 22-year-old female named Annie. The user is the guy, and he's in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. The key points here are the sleepover, the fact that Annie is in a long-term relationship, and the girlfriend's reaction based on past conversations about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about Annie coming over. While they both decided not to go to the party, they ended up in his room watching TV and smoking. They fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out the next day, and she was upset. Now, the girlfriend points out that the author didn't notice her being bothered by previous interactions where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival when the girlfriend was alone. The author didn't mean anything by it, but he had mentioned Annie in the context of hypothetical threesomes, which the girlfriend found significant.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, communication is key. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a red flag. Even if it was a spontaneous thing, not mentioning it before or after might be an issue. The girlfriend's anger is partly due to the unspoken conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned his friend. That's a crucial point because even if he didn't act on it, the mention could have caused insecurity.\n\nThe author claims he didn't initiate anything inappropriate, but the girlfriend felt hurt. The fact that he wasn't aware of her feelings about previous interactions shows a lack of awareness. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be honest and considerate of each other's feelings. The author might not have done anything malicious, but neglecting to communicate and being oblivious to her concerns could be seen as a mistake. However, since he didn't act on the hypothetical threesome conversation and didn't have intentions with Annie, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But the girlfriend's perspective is valid because he wasn't transparent, and the mention of Annie in that context might have planted seeds of doubt. So the answer might be A, but considering all factors, I think the answer is B.\n"
