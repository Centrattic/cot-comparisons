  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his friend, Annie, in his bed while his girlfriend was out. The girlfriend was upset about it. \n\nFirst, the guy didn't initiate anything, just fell asleep with his friend. The girlfriend found out the next day. The main points here are about boundaries in relationships. The girlfriend felt uncomfortable because Annie had previously crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival when the girlfriend was nearby. But the guy didn't see those actions as problematic.\n\nThe key issue seems to be communication and mutual understanding of boundaries. The girlfriend felt that the sleepover went too far, especially considering they had joked about threesomes before. Even though the guy didn't have ill intentions, the girlfriend felt her boundaries were violated. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners need to agree on what's acceptable. If the girlfriend expressed discomfort before about Annie's behavior, the guy should have been more aware. Even if he didn't mean anything by it, not being sensitive to her feelings could be a problem. Also, not asking her about the sleepover might have been a mistake because it shows a lack of communication.\n\nHowever, the guy didn't initiate anything, and Annie was in a relationship too. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by past jokes about threesomes, which could have made her more sensitive. Still, the guy's responsibility is to consider his partner's feelings and avoid situations that could make her uncomfortable, even if he doesn't see the issue. \n\nSo, while the guy didn't act with malicious intent, he might have overlooked his girlfriend's boundaries. Being hyper-aware of his actions towards Annie is a sign he's trying to respect her feelings now. The main question is whether he should have considered her perspective earlier. Since the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and the guy didn't check with her before the sleepover, he might be at fault for not being more attentive to her feelings.\n"
