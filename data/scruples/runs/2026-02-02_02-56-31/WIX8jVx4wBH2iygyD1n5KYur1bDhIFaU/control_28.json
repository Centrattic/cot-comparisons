One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend (GF) getting upset because the author had a sleepover with a female friend (Annie) in his room. The GF was at a concert with her friend, and the author didn't inform the GF about the sleepover. The GF was upset because she felt the author didn't notice her discomfort with Annie's behavior, like holding his hand and playing with his hair when she was nearby. Also, there was a past conversation where they joked about having threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie. The GF now feels the author didn't communicate enough and didn't consider her feelings.\n\nFirst, the main issue is communication. The author didn't ask his GF about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. In relationships, even if something seems innocent, not discussing it can lead to hurt feelings. The GF was upset because she felt the author didn't notice her discomfort around Annie. That suggests the author might not have been fully aware of how his actions affected her, even if he didn't intend anything.\n\nThe author argues that the GF overreacted. However, the GF's reaction stems from past jokes about threesomes and specific incidents with Annie. The fact that the GF pointed out the author didn't notice her discomfort indicates there might be a pattern of behavior she's been dealing with. The author's failure to recognize these signs could be seen as neglecting her feelings.\n\nAdditionally, the sleepover itself, while perhaps innocent, can be a sensitive issue in a relationship. Even if the author didn't initiate anything, the GF might feel that the situation was a boundary issue. The author's lack of communication here is key. Not informing the GF could lead to trust issues, especially if there's a history of discussing boundaries.\n\nThe author's fear of the friendship with Annie changing is valid, but the GF's feelings are equally important. The balance here is tricky. The author might not be entirely at fault for the sleepover itself, but the oversight in considering the GF's perspective and not communicating adequately could place some responsibility on him.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate their boundaries and expectations. The author didn't check in with his GF about the sleepover and didn't seem to notice her discomfort earlier. This could indicate a lack of attentiveness to her feelings. Therefore, even if the actions themselves were innocent, the failure to be considerate and communicate might mean the author is partially at fault.\n"
