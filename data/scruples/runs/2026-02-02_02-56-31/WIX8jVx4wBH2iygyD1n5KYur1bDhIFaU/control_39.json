One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a guy (21M) who had a sleepover with his female friend (22F) and didn't inform his girlfriend (20F). The girlfriend is upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and the guy mentioned the friend.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. The author was with a friend in his room, they drank, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't expecting this. Even if it was innocent, the key here is communication. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, and the author didn't ask if it was okay. In relationships, even if actions are harmless, not communicating can lead to hurt feelings. The fact that the girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and the author didn't mention the sleepover might be a red flag for her. \n\nThen there's the past conversation about threesomes. Even if they were just joking, the fact that the author mentioned the friend by name could make the girlfriend feel that the friend is a potential third wheel in their relationship. The girlfriend might feel that the author's casual mention of the friend in that context led her to question where he stands, especially when the sleepover happened. The author not noticing the friend's boundaries being crossed (like hand-holding and hair-playing) before the incident suggests a lack of awareness about the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe author claims he didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Trust and communication are crucial in relationships. The author didn't consider how the girlfriend would feel about the sleepover, especially after the previous conversation. Even if the author didn't act on any intentions, the girlfriend's perspective is important. The fear of affecting the friendship with Annie might be valid, but the priority should be the current relationship if the girlfriend is upset.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of actions, but he's definitely in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and for not communicating the situation. The answer likely leans towards A, but I need to check if the actions themselves are problematic. Since the sleepover could be seen as crossing a boundary without the girlfriend's knowledge, even if innocent, the author's lack of communication and previous comments about the friend are points against him. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
