One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their friend Annie and not informing their girlfriend. The key points here are the circumstances of the sleepover, the girlfriend's reaction, and the history of discussing threesomes.\n\nFirst, the sleepover happened because their friend bailed on the party, so they didn't go. They watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't there at the time. The next morning, they told the girlfriend about Annie sleeping in the bed. The girlfriend was upset, partly because of previous instances where Annie was overly familiar, like playing with hair and holding hands at a festival. The user mentions that they hadn't noticed these things and thought they were harmless. Also, there was a prior joke about threesomes where the user mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend brought up as a contributing factor.\n\nThe main question is whether the user is in the wrong. The girlfriend's main issues are the sleepover and the prior jokes about threesomes. From a relationship standpoint, transparency is important. Even if they didn't plan for Annie to stay over, not discussing it with their partner could be seen as a lack of communication. The girlfriend felt her boundaries were crossed, especially with the previous jokes about threesomes involving Annie. Even if the user didn't have ulterior motives, their actions might have made the girlfriend feel insecure. The user also mentions being hyper-aware now around Annie, which affects their friendship. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to consider how your actions make your partner feel. Even if the user didn't mean anything by it, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The prior discussion about threesomes adds context that might have made the sleepover situation more sensitive. The user didn't do anything explicitly wrong, but they might have been negligent in considering their partner's feelings and boundaries. So, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and the user's actions could be seen as dismissive of her feelings might lean towards the user being in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
