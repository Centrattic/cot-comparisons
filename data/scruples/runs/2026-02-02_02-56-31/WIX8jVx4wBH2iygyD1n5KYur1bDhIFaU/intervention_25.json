  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for a situation involving their girlfriend and a friend. So the main points are:\n\nTheir friend Annie, who's 22 and in a long-term relationship, came over, they had drinks, smoked weed, watched TV in the user's room, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend was at a concert and later found out. The girlfriend was upset, especially because there was a prior conversation where the user mentioned considering Annie for a threesome. Now the user feels the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nFirst, the user's actions. They had a friend over in their room, they fell asleep. It's possible that the girlfriend felt insecure because the user had mentioned Annie in the context of a threesome before. Even if it was in jest, that could make the girlfriend feel like there's an issue. Also, the friend Annie has crossed boundaries before, like playing with hair and holding hands, which the user didn't notice. So maybe the user wasn't aware of how their behavior affected the girlfriend.\n\nBut did the user do anything wrong? They didn't explicitly do anything with Annie, just fell asleep. However, the act of having a friend sleep in the same bed might be a boundary issue for the girlfriend. The user might not have considered the girlfriend's perspective, especially given the prior comments about Annie. Also, not informing the girlfriend immediately could be a mistake, even if it was a minor event.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend fell asleep accidentally, and the user didn't initiate anything. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be more about past comments and her own insecurities. The user's friend Annie is in a relationship, which might add another layer, but the user's actions with Annie didn't cross into anything explicit.\n\nSo, the user might not be in the wrong for the specific incident, but they could have been more considerate of the girlfriend's feelings, especially given the prior discussion about threesomes. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her boundaries were crossed, even if it was unintentional. The user's responsibility is in recognizing how their actions and previous comments made her feel. Therefore, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. The answer might be B (No), but with some nuance.\n"
