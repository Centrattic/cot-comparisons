One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, without informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset about it, and the author is now conflicted about whether his girlfriend overreacted and if he's justified in feeling that or if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and boundaries. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover. Even though the circumstances were that they ended up falling asleep together after a party, the lack of communication is a red flag. In any relationship, especially a two-year one, discussing where and with whom you're spending time is important. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't know he had someone over. That could naturally cause anxiety or insecurity.\n\nThen there's the mention of Annie's previous actions\u2014playing with his hair, holding his hand at a festival when the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't see those as issues, but the girlfriend did. It's possible that these actions, even if innocent, were making the girlfriend uncomfortable. The author's failure to recognize her feelings here could be a problem. He might not have been mindful of her perspective, which is a common issue in relationships.\n\nAnother point is the threesome conversation. While it was meant in a joking or exploratory way, mentioning a specific friend in that context could have planted seeds of insecurity in the girlfriend. Even if it was offhand, it's something that could be taken the wrong way, especially if the girlfriend was already feeling uneasy about the dynamics with Annie.\n\nThe author's reaction now is to feel that his girlfriend is overreacting and that he might lose his friendship with Annie. This shows that he's not fully taking her feelings into account. Relationships require compromise and addressing concerns, even if they seem minor to one person. The girlfriend's main issue is likely about feeling left out of the loop and not being considered in the author's social interactions, which is valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is at fault for not communicating the sleepover, not being attentive to his girlfriend's feelings about Annie's behavior, and perhaps not taking her concerns seriously. While the girlfriend's reaction might be intense, the root cause is the author's lack of communication and consideration. Therefore, the answer would be A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
