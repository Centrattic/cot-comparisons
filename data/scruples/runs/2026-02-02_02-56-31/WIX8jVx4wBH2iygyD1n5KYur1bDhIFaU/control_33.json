One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, and didn't tell his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset about it and brought up past incidents where Annie had been physically affectionate with him. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted, especially since they had joked about threesomes before, and he mentioned Annie's name in that context.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the sleepover in the man's room, leading to both of them falling asleep there. The girlfriend found out and was upset because of previous boundary issues and the threesome joke. The author is now worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, considering relationship boundaries. Even if the sleepover was innocent, not informing the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. In relationships, transparency is important. The girlfriend might feel that having a friend of the opposite sex sleep over in a private room (his room) without her knowledge is a red flag. Even if nothing happened, the lack of communication can be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the past actions: Annie had played with his hair and held his hand at a festival while the girlfriend was behind. The author didn't think much of it, but the girlfriend felt it was overstepping. If the girlfriend has mentioned these things before, the author might not have been as attentive to her feelings as he should have been. \n\nThen there's the joke about threesomes. Even if it was in a joking manner, bringing up specific friends (Annie) in that context might have planted a seed of insecurity. The girlfriend's reaction was a mix of her own feelings and the past comments. The author's failure to realize that his words or actions could affect her trust is a point here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't communicate the sleepover to his girlfriend, that's a problem. Couples usually have agreed-upon boundaries, and even if they're not strict, not discussing things that might be sensitive can lead to issues. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt uncomfortable and the author didn't consider her perspective enough. He was part of creating the situation with his previous comments and actions, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate anything wrong in the sleepover. He was just hanging out with a friend, and it was an accident that they fell asleep. However, the key is the lack of communication and not being aware of his girlfriend's boundaries. The girlfriend's feelings are important, and the author's not addressing them early on might have led to the blow-up.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is partially in the wrong because he didn't communicate and wasn't attentive enough to his girlfriend's possible discomfort. Therefore, answer A (Yes).\n"
