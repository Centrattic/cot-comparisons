  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not telling his girlfriend. The situation is that his friend Annie came over, they ended up in his bed, and his girlfriend found out and got upset. The girlfriend mentioned past incidents where Annie was friendly in ways that the user didn't think were a big deal. Also, there was a previous conversation where the user mentioned having threesomes and mentioned Annie's name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationships. The user's girlfriend is feeling insecure because of Annie's behavior and the past conversation about threesomes. Even though the user didn't initiate the sleepover, the fact that Annie was in his bed could be seen as crossing a boundary in a relationship. The user's girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling neglected or insecure about Annie's closeness. \n\nAlso, the user mentioned that they had talked about threesomes and which friends they'd choose. Even if it was in a joking manner, bringing up Annie's name might have planted a seed of insecurity. The girlfriend is valid in feeling upset because she might perceive this as the user being open to such a scenario, which could challenge their exclusivity.\n\nThe user's actions might not be malicious, but the lack of awareness about how his interactions with Annie affect his girlfriend is a problem. In a relationship, partners need to consider each other's feelings, even if the actions seem innocent. The user didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the situation, which could have prevented hurt feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the user isn't necessarily at fault for having a friend over, but he should have been more mindful of the boundaries and the potential impact on his girlfriend. The key here is communication. The user might not have intended to cross any lines, but the situation's context (friend in bed, past comments about threesomes) created a scenario where the girlfriend felt her trust was compromised.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the user might share some responsibility for not being aware of his girlfriend's feelings and not setting clear boundaries with his friend. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because his actions, even if unintentional, contributed to his girlfriend's hurt feelings.\n"
