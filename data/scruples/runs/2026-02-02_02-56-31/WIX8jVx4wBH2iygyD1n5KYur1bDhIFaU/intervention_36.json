One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and not telling their girlfriend. So, the situation: he's 21, his friend Annie is 22, his girlfriend is 20. Annie came over to hang out, they watched TV, smoked, fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out and was upset. She mentioned that the user had previously joked about having threesomes with Annie. The user feels the girlfriend overreacted and is now struggling with how to act around Annie, fearing it might affect their friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Trust and communication are key in relationships. Even if the user didn't do anything intentionally wrong, not informing his girlfriend about a sleepover in his own room could be a red flag. The girlfriend might feel insecure, especially since there was a previous conversation about threesomes. Even if that conversation was playful, it could have planted seeds of doubt. The user not noticing the friend's overstepping boundaries (like playing with hair, holding hands) suggests he might be unaware of how those actions could be perceived, which could contribute to the girlfriend's anxiety.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't initiate the sleepover, and there was no physical intimacy beyond sleeping. He informed the girlfriend the next day. The fact that the girlfriend acknowledged he didn't do anything wrong but was still upset might indicate her own insecurities rather than the user's fault. However, the previous discussion about threesomes could have made her more sensitive. The user's hyper-awareness now shows he's trying to adjust, but the question is whether he was in the wrong initially.\n\nThe main issues are communication and the girlfriend's valid feelings due to past conversations. While the user didn't act maliciously, not considering her feelings in the context of their previous talks might make him partly responsible. But it's a nuanced situation. The answer might be B (No) because he didn't do anything intentional, but he should have considered her feelings more. However, the girlfriend also might be overreacting. Maybe the answer is B, but there's a need for better communication from both sides.\n"
