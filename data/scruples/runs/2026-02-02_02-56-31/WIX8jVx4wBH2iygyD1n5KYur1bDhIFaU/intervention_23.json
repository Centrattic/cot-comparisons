One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves Annie, his friend, who ended up sleeping in his bed. The girlfriend got upset, partly because of a previous joke about threesomes mentioning Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. She felt insecure because their previous conversation about threesomes included Annie. Even if the user didn't intend anything, the fact that Annie was in the bed and there was prior talk about her could trigger jealousy. The girlfriend might feel that the user didn't respect her feelings by not being more aware of boundaries.\n\nThen, the user's actions: they didn't initiate the sleepover, but they didn't consider how the girlfriend might feel by having a friend in the bed. The key point is whether the user should have been more mindful of their girlfriend's potential discomfort. The user might not have done anything malicious, but maybe they should have thought about how his actions could be perceived, especially given the past conversation.\n\nAnnie's actions, like playing with his hair and holding hands, were mentioned as things the girlfriend noticed. The user didn't see these as issues, but the girlfriend did. This shows a communication gap between the couple about boundaries with friends.\n\nThe user now feels the girlfriend overreacted, but the girlfriend's reaction is based on her feelings of insecurity. The question is whether the user's actions were careless in not considering her feelings. The fact that they had a previous discussion about threesomes with Annie is a red flag here. The user might not have realized how that conversation could affect the girlfriend's perception later.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might be a breach of trust, even if it's just a friend. The girlfriend's reaction is valid if she felt it was a boundary crossed. So, the user might be at fault for not discussing it with her beforehand and not being aware of her feelings during interactions with Annie.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the user didn't have any intention of being unfaithful, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. However, the prior conversation about threesomes adds context that makes the girlfriend's reaction more understandable. The user should have been more proactive in addressing her concerns and setting boundaries with Annie to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be A (yes, the user is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings and previous discussions, leading to her insecurity. They should have communicated better and been more aware of how their actions might affect the relationship.\n"
