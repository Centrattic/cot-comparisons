  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether he's in the wrong for having a sleepover with his friend Annie without telling his girlfriend. First, I need to look at the details.\n\nHe had a friend over, they had drinks, maybe smoked some weed, ended up falling asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was overfamiliar, and a previous conversation where he joked about having a threesome with Annie. The user didn't think much of it at the time but now feels his girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: communication, boundaries, and past actions. Even if the sleepover itself was innocent, the girlfriend felt her boundaries were crossed. Trust is important in a relationship, and not informing her could be an issue. Also, the past comments about threesomes with Annie might have made the situation more sensitive. The user didn't realize how his actions affected her, which is a communication breakdown. While he didn't have bad intentions, not acknowledging her feelings and not being aware of her discomfort could be where he's at fault. Friendships might need adjustments to respect the girlfriend's feelings, but that doesn't mean the friend is a bad person. The answer would likely be that he's not entirely in the wrong but needs to consider his girlfriend's perspective more. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), but there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
