One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The main points are:\n\n- The author's friend Annie came over to his place, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out later.\n- The girlfriend was upset because of past instances where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with the author's hair or holding his hand while she was alone. The author didn't notice these things.\n- The girlfriend also mentioned a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the author had mentioned Annie. That seems to have triggered her reaction.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. The girlfriend is upset because she felt insecure, even though the author didn't intend anything inappropriate. The key here is the girlfriend's perspective and how communication (or lack thereof) played a role.\n\nThe author didn't actively do anything wrong in terms of initiating something with Annie, but he didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend. Even if it was innocent, not informing his girlfriend about a friend sleeping in his bed could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's feelings are valid even if the author didn't mean to hurt her. The fact that they had a prior conversation about threesomes involving Annie adds another layer, as it might have made the situation more sensitive.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not have realized the impact of his actions, but the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling insecure and not being prioritized. The author's responsibility includes acknowledging her feelings and addressing them, not just his own perspective. So, even if he didn't do anything malicious, he might be at fault for not considering her feelings and not maintaining open communication.\n"
