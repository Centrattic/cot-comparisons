  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their friend Annie and not informing their girlfriend. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the guy and his friend Annie, who's in a relationship, had a sleepover in his room after a party plan fell through. They watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over. He told her the next day but didn't think much of it. Later, the girlfriend gets upset, mentioning past instances where Annie might have been overstepping, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. Also, there was a previous joke about threesomes where he mentioned Annie.\n\nThe main issue here is the girlfriend feeling her boundaries were crossed. Even though the guy didn't intentionally do anything wrong, he didn't consider her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might seem over the top, but relationships are about communication and mutual respect. The fact that they had discussed threesomes in a joking way and he mentioned Annie could have planted seeds of doubt in her mind.\n\nEven if the sleepover was innocent, not asking his girlfriend about it shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. The key points are communication and how his actions, even if not malicious, affected her. Friendships and relationships both require being mindful of each other's boundaries. By not addressing her concerns sooner and not being aware of how his interactions with Annie made her feel, he did contribute to the problem.\n\nSo, while the situation might not be a big deal in isolation, the cumulative effect of past behaviors and the lack of communication on his part probably did play a role in her feelings. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being more attentive to her perspective.\n"
