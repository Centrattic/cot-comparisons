  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend where their girlfriend found out and is upset. The main points here are the nature of the interaction, the girlfriend's reaction, and the context of their relationship.\n\nFirst, the user and their female friend Annie were at a party, then ended up in his room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and felt it was inappropriate. The user didn't think much of it initially. The girlfriend also mentioned past behaviors like Annie playing with his hair and holding his hand, which the user didn't see as issues. Additionally, there's a mention of joking about threesomes and mentioning Annie, which the girlfriend feels is why this upset her.\n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries. Even if the user didn't intend anything, the fact that Annie was in his bed and they fell asleep together might be seen as crossing a line by the girlfriend. She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and boundaries are important. The girlfriend is expressing her feelings about what's appropriate, so the user might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective and for not being more mindful of Annie's actions in the past. Also, the past conversation about threesomes and mentioning Annie could have set expectations that the girlfriend felt were violated, even if it was in jest.\n\nHowever, the user didn't initiate the sleepover, and they had a close friendship with Annie. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her own insecurities or past discussions. The user's lack of awareness about Annie's overstepping in the past (like hand-holding) could indicate a pattern that the user didn't recognize. In healthy relationships, communication is key, and the user might have failed to consider how their actions affected the girlfriend. Even if the actions were innocent, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the user should respect her boundaries. So, the answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong for not being more attentive to her feelings and the boundaries she has in their relationship.\n"
