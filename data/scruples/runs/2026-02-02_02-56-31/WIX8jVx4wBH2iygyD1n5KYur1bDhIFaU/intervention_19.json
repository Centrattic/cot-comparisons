  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend felt uncomfortable after finding out about the sleepover and some past interactions with Annie.\n\nFirst, the key points: The user and his friend Annie were at a party, ended up in his room, fell asleep together. The girlfriend was out with friends and found out later. The girlfriend is upset not just about the sleepover but also past instances where Annie was physically affectionate with the user, which he didn't think were an issue. Additionally, the user mentioned Annie in hypothetical threesome conversations, which the girlfriend points out as a trigger for her feelings.\n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. The user didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a red flag. Even if they were just sleeping, the fact that Annie was in his bed might be a boundary issue the girlfriend has. Also, the past interactions with Annie, like holding hands or playing with hair, might have been overlooked by the user but are significant to the girlfriend. The mention of Annie in threesome discussions, even hypothetically, adds another layer of why the girlfriend feels threatened or insecure.\n\nThe user argues that he didn't do anything wrong since he didn't initiate the sleepover and Annie fell asleep there. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In relationships, transparency and considering the partner's comfort level with friends are important. The user's lack of awareness about how his actions affect his girlfriend's emotions might be why she's upset. \n\nOn the other hand, the user feels that the girlfriend is overreacting and that his friendship with Annie might suffer. But the core issue here is mutual understanding and communication. The user didn't check in with his girlfriend about his plans, which is a basic expectation in many relationships. The girlfriend's reaction is a response to cumulative experiences where she felt her boundaries were not respected, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user might not be in the \"wrong\" in terms of intent, but he's definitely in the wrong for not being considerate of his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. The key is that actions have consequences in relationships, and even if unintended, they can cause hurt. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
