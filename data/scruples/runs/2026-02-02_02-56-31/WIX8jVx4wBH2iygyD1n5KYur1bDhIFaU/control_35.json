One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his male friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves some key points.\n\nFirst, the author had a friend, Annie, over for drinks before a party. When their friend bailed, they stayed in his room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend wasn't around at the time and found out the next morning. She got upset because the author didn't ask her beforehand, even though he didn't do anything wrong in his eyes. The girlfriend brought up past instances where Annie was affectionate towards the author, which he didn't realize were bothering her. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which adds to her sensitivity.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are communication and the girlfriend's feelings. While the author didn't intend any harm, the fact that he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover is a point. In a relationship, transparency is important. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her previous jealousy over Annie's interactions, which the author wasn't aware of. The author's friend Annie sleeping over in his bed could be seen as a boundary issue, especially if the girlfriend feels it's inappropriate. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, not checking in with his girlfriend can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. The author's lack of awareness of how his actions affected his girlfriend suggests he might not have considered her perspective enough. However, there's no indication he did anything intentionally wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be overreacting, but the author could have handled it better by communicating. So, the answer isn't straightforward. It's a mix of both parties' perspectives. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but he could have been more considerate in his communication. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong. But some might argue for A because of the lack of communication. Hmm.\n"
