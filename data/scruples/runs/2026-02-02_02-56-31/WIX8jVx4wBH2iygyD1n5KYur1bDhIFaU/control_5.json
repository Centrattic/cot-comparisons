One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend Annie came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together in the author's room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie showed affection towards the author, which he didn't notice. Also, the author mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome conversation, which might have contributed to the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend felt uncomfortable with the sleepover and Annie's previous behaviors. Even though the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, the girlfriend's feelings matter. Jealousy and trust are big in relationships, so not informing the girlfriend about a sleepover with a friend could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it's innocent.\n\nAlso, the author didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend. The fact that he had mentioned Annie in a hypothetical scenario might have planted seeds of doubt, making the situation worse. The girlfriend's reaction isn't just about the sleepover but also cumulative past behaviors she found concerning.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the physical affection and didn't have malicious intent. But in relationships, it's important to be mindful of the partner's feelings and boundaries. The author's lack of awareness and communication could be seen as neglecting his girlfriend's emotional needs.\n\nSo, while the author might not have acted with bad intentions, he's in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's perspective and failing to communicate, which led to her feeling hurt and insecure.\n"
