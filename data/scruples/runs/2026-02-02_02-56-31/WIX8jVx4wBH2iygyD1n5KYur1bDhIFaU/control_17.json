One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves a few key points.\n\nFirst, the author had a friend, Annie, over. They were drinking, smoked weed, watched TV in his room, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The main issues here are the context of the situation and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nThe author mentions that Annie is in a long-term relationship, so there's no indication she was interested in anything romantic with the author. The author didn't initiate the sleepover but also didn't think to inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend brought up past instances where Annie was affectionate, which the author didn't realize were a problem. There's also a mention of a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes involving Annie, which might have contributed to the girlfriend's feelings of betrayal.\n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is key. Even if the author didn't have intentions, not informing his girlfriend about having a friend over in the bed could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt uncomfortable with the boundaries being crossed. The fact that they had discussed threesomes in a joking way might have made her feel that the author was more open to the idea than he thought, leading to her concern.\n\nHowever, the author didn't act on any intentions; he just had a friend over for a sleepover. The problem arises from not being aware of how his actions affected his girlfriend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not being proactive about communication or if the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nIn many relationships, even if there's no physical intimacy, the partner's comfort level matters. The author might not have done anything intentionally wrong, but the lack of awareness about his girlfriend's feelings could be a mistake. So it's a bit of a gray area. But since the girlfriend is the one who felt hurt and the author didn't consider her perspective, there's a case for the author being in the wrong for not being more communicative and considerate of her feelings.\n"
