  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and not informing their girlfriend. The main issue here is about boundaries in relationships.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user's friend, Annie, came over for drinks, then they ended up watching TV and smoking in his room, falling asleep together. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was affectionate towards the user, like holding hands and playing with hair, which the user didn't think were issues. Also, there was a previous joke about threesomes involving Annie mentioned by the user. Now, the girlfriend is upset, and the user feels it's blown out of proportion and is affecting their friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the user do something wrong by not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover? Is the girlfriend overreacting? Let's look at relationship norms. In many relationships, partners discuss and agree on boundaries regarding interactions with friends of the opposite gender. If the user didn't communicate this sleepover, even if it was innocent, it might be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the girlfriend felt it was important. \n\nThe user admitted they didn't think about how it might bother the girlfriend. While the actions might seem harmless, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt uncomfortable and there's a history of the user joking about threesomes with Annie. This could make her feel insecure, even if the user didn't intend anything. \n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't initiate anything and the sleepover was accidental. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by past comments and her own insecurities. However, in relationships, partners often value being informed about their partner's activities, especially when friends are involved. The user's failure to mention the sleepover immediately could have contributed to the misunderstanding. \n\nIs the user at fault for the sleepover itself? Maybe not, but not communicating with their girlfriend about it and not considering her feelings could be a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction, while possibly influenced by past jokes, is a valid expression of her feelings. The user now feels hyper-aware and concerned about their friendship, which shows they care about both relationships but might need to balance communication better.\n\nSo, the answer isn't entirely clear-cut. However, the user did not act with malice, but their lack of communication and awareness of the girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and not considering the girlfriend's perspective, even if the actions themselves were innocent.\n"
