  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend (Annie) and not telling their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The user's friend Annie came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together in the user's room. The girlfriend was at a concert with friends and didn't come over. The user told the girlfriend the next day, but didn't think much of it. \n\nThen the girlfriend brought up other instances where Annie might have crossed boundaries, like playing with hair and holding hands at a festival. The user didn't think these meant anything and loves their girlfriend. The girlfriend mentioned that the user had previously joked about having threesomes with Annie, which might have made her more sensitive.\n\nSo, the main points are: sharing a bed with a friend of the opposite sex without informing the partner, past jokes about threesomes with that friend, and the girlfriend feeling that the user didn't notice her discomfort.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. Even if the user didn't intend anything, not considering the girlfriend's feelings could be an issue. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid because she felt the user didn't respect her feelings, especially since there was prior talk about threesomes. The user might not have done anything malicious, but the act of sleeping with a friend in the same bed could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if unintentionally. The user's lack of awareness about the girlfriend's discomfort is a problem here. They should have been more considerate of how their actions could make the girlfriend feel. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because of not considering the girlfriend's perspective and potential insecurities.\n"
