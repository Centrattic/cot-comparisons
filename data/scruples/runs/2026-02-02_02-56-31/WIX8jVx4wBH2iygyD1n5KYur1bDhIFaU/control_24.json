One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author had a friend, Annie, sleep over in his room after they both decided not to go to a party. They watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because they had previously jokingly discussed threesomes involving Annie.\n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate for Annie to be in the author's bed, even if nothing happened. The author didn't notice the girlfriend's discomfort before, which might indicate a lack of communication on his part. Also, the fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly might have made the situation more sensitive for the girlfriend, as it could seem like the author was fantasizing about their friend, which can be a trigger for jealousy.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are crucial. Even if the author didn't do anything wrong intentionally, not being aware of his girlfriend's feelings and the potential for misinterpretation could be his fault. The girlfriend's reaction, while maybe intense, stems from her feelings of insecurity or the conversation they had about threesomes. The author should have considered her feelings and perhaps avoided situations that could cause her distress, even if they were innocent.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting, especially if there was no intention to cross boundaries. But the author's failure to recognize her discomfort and the context of their previous conversation about threesomes adds layers to this. The author's responsibility includes being mindful of his partner's feelings and adjusting his behavior to avoid unnecessary hurt, even if it's unintentional.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: The author might not be in the wrong for the action itself (sleeping over was innocent), but he missed his girlfriend's feelings and the context of their previous discussion, which makes him partially to blame for not being more considerate. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate and was unaware, contributing to the conflict.\n"
