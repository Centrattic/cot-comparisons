One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their female friend and not notifying their girlfriend. The main points here are about boundaries in relationships and communication.\n\nFirst, the user had a friend over, they watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out the next day. The girlfriend was upset because she felt the friend was overstepping boundaries, like playing with hair and holding hands in the past. Also, there's a past conversation where they joked about threesomes and the user mentioned the friend, which the girlfriend brought up as a trigger.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user did something wrong. Let's consider relationship norms. Generally, in a committed relationship, partners expect transparency and consideration regarding their boundaries. Even if the sleepover was innocent, not informing the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the girlfriend has expressed concerns before about the friend's behavior.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is rooted in her feeling that her boundaries were not respected. The past joking about threesomes might have made her more sensitive about the friend's presence. The user might not have intended to cross any lines, but the lack of communication and the girlfriend's feelings are important here.\n\nThe user is now worried about their friendship with the friend and feels the situation was blown out of proportion. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt uncomfortable and unconsidered. The key issue here is communication and respecting the girlfriend's boundaries, even if the actions themselves were innocent.\n\nSo, the user might not be in the wrong for the actions themselves but could be in the wrong for not considering their girlfriend's feelings and not communicating. The answer would likely be B (No), because the user didn't intentionally cross boundaries, but there's a need for better communication. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, so the user should address that. The main point is that intent vs. impact matters here. The user's impact on the girlfriend's feelings was negative, even if the intent was innocent. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes) because even if unintended, the action caused distress and there was a lack of communication. The fact that they had previously discussed threesomes and mentioned the friend could have been a red flag. Therefore, the user should have been more mindful of the girlfriend's perspective and communicated better. Hence, they might be in the wrong.\n"
