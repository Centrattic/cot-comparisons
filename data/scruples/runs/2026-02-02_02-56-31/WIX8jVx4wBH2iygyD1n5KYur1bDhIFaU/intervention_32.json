One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and not informing their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset because the friend, Annie, fell asleep in their bed, and there were other instances where Annie was overfamiliar, like holding hands at a festival.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that Annie fell asleep in their room after watching TV and smoking. The girlfriend wasn't there, and the user didn't think to inform her. But the girlfriend later brings up past incidents where Annie crossed boundaries, which the user didn't notice. The key point is whether the user violated any boundaries even if they didn't intend to.\n\nThe user and Annie had a conversation about hypothetical threesomes where he mentioned Annie, which might have made the girlfriend feel insecure. The user now feels the girlfriend overreacted, but they're also concerned about affecting their friendship with Annie by being hyper-aware.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the user didn't do anything intentional, not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a lack of consideration. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from prior concerns about Annie's behavior that the user overlooked. The fact that they had discussed threesomes hypothetically might add to her anxiety, even if it was just playful talk.\n\nHowever, the user didn't initiate any physical contact and the situation was accidental. The main issue might be the lack of communication rather than the act itself. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt uncomfortable, but the user isn't necessarily at fault for not realizing her sensitivity until she explained it.\n\nSo, the answer might be a balance. But according to the options given, since the user didn't do anything intentional but failed to communicate, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong) but with the caveat that communication could have prevented the issue. Alternatively, the user could be seen as partially at fault for not considering the girlfriend's feelings beforehand. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The girlfriend's reaction is valid given the past context, but the user isn't malicious. Probably answer B, but acknowledge the need for better communication.\n"
