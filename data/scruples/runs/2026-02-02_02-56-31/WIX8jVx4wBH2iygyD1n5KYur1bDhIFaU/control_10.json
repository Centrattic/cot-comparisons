One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, didn't inform his girlfriend, and now the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend is 20, the friend is 22, both in a two-year relationship. The friend came over, they ended up in the same room, fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past incidents where the friend was affectionate towards the author in her presence, which the author didn't notice. Also, there's a history of joking about threesomes with the friend, specifically mentioning her. The girlfriend called the sleepover inappropriate, and the author feels she's overreacting, which is affecting his friendship with Annie.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms. In most relationships, partners expect certain boundaries, especially regarding physical proximity with others. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about feeling insecure or overlooked. The fact that they had previous discussions about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie in that context adds another layer. Even if it was in jest, it could make the girlfriend feel that her partner is more open to such scenarios with Annie, which might explain her heightened sensitivity.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend pointed out the author's lack of awareness about Annie's behavior, which he didn't notice. That suggests a possible pattern where the author was either too trusting of Annie's boundaries or didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend's feelings. The author's defense is that he didn't intend anything, but intention isn't always the main factor in relationships\u2014perception and communication matter a lot.\n\nSo, while the author might not have done anything malicious, not considering his girlfriend's perspective and not setting clear boundaries with Annie could be seen as a mistake. The girlfriend has a right to feel uncomfortable if she's in a relationship and her partner is in a situation that could be misinterpreted. The author's lack of awareness and communication might be why the girlfriend felt the need to address it seriously.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings and communicated with her about the sleepover. Even if it was innocent, not discussing it could lead to misunderstandings. The answer might lean towards the author being partially at fault for not considering his girlfriend's perspective and for the lack of communication, hence AITA.\n"
