One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author had a friend sleep over in their bed, and the girlfriend got upset. The author didn't ask their girlfriend about it and now feels the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend is in a two-year relationship with the author. The friend, Annie, is in a long-term relationship too. They had a sleepover, fell asleep together in the author's room. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nSo, the main points here are: 1) Friend sleeping over in the same bed, 2) The author didn't inform the girlfriend, 3) The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially given past comments about threesomes, and 4) The author now feels the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nThe key issue is communication and boundaries in a relationship. The author didn't check with their girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if they didn't have intentions. Then there's the past conversation about threesomes, which adds context. Even if it was just joking, the girlfriend might feel that the author's choice of mentioning Annie in that context made the sleepover situation more problematic.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, transparency is important. The author didn't inform their partner about the sleepover, which could be seen as neglecting the partner's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling insecure or not respected. The author might not have intended harm, but the action still affected the girlfriend's trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that there was no intention of wrongdoing, and the friendship with Annie is important. However, the fact that they didn't communicate with their girlfriend is a red flag. Even if the situation was innocent, the lack of communication can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings.\n\nThe part about the previous conversation about threesomes is significant. Even if it was a joke, the author's choice of Annie in that context might have made the girlfriend feel that the author was more open to such situations with Annie, leading to her current reaction. The author's not noticing these boundaries could be a lack of consideration for the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong for the sleepover itself, but the failure to communicate and the prior comments about threesomes contribute to the girlfriend's distress. The author's responsibility is to consider their partner's feelings and maintain open communication. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because there was no intentional harm, but the author should have been more communicative. However, the context of the threesomes conversation might tip it towards A. But the question is if the author is in the wrong, not just if they were careless. Since the author didn't do anything with intent, maybe B is the answer. But some might argue that even without intent, not considering the partner's feelings is a problem. Hmm.\n"
