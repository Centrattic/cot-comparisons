One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, and didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset about it and brought up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding his hand and playing with his hair when the girlfriend wasn't around. Also, the author had mentioned to the girlfriend before that he'd consider having a threesome with Annie, which she found upsetting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is whether the author did something wrong by allowing his friend to sleep in his bed without telling his girlfriend. Even though he didn't initiate the sleepover, the fact that it happened in his room and he didn't inform his girlfriend might be a problem. Also, the girlfriend had mentioned past concerns about Annie's behavior, which he didn't notice or address. \n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend. But the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially considering their previous conversations about threesomes. The author now feels the situation was blown out of proportion and is worried about his friendship with Annie. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, transparency is key. Even if the sleepover was innocent, not communicating with the girlfriend about it could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's concerns about Annie's boundaries might be valid, and the author's lack of awareness about how his actions affected her could be a sign of not being attentive to her feelings. \n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and didn't have intentions of anything inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by past talks about threesomes, which adds another layer. The author might feel the reaction is unfair because the situation wasn't malicious. \n\nI need to weigh whether the author's actions, while maybe not intentional, still disregarded his girlfriend's feelings. The key points are the lack of communication and not addressing the girlfriend's prior concerns about Annie's behavior. Even if the author didn't mean harm, not being mindful of his girlfriend's perspective is a mistake. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably A (Yes), because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover and didn't consider her past concerns about Annie, leading to hurt feelings. But maybe B (No) if the actions were truly innocent and the girlfriend is overreacting. It's a bit of a grey area. However, in relationships, actions that make a partner feel insecure or disrespected can be considered wrong, even if unintended. The fact that he mentioned wanting to have a threesome with Annie in the past might have contributed to her anxiety, so he should have been more cautious. Therefore, leaning towards A.\n"
