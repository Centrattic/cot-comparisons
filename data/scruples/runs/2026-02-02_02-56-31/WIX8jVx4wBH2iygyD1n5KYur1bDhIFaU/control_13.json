One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a friend (Annie) sleep over in his bed, and his girlfriend got upset about it. The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points: The sleepover happened because they didn't want to go to a party alone. They watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out the next morning. She was upset because of past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding his hand while she was alone. Also, there's a mention of a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes, and he mentioned Annie. The girlfriend admitted he didn't initiate anything wrong, but he didn't notice her discomfort. Now he's worried about how this affects his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the main issues here are boundaries in a relationship and communication. The girlfriend felt her boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't intend to. The fact that there was prior joking about threesomes involving Annie might have made the sleepover seem more significant. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the context of their previous conversation could be a problem. Also, the author didn't check in with his girlfriend about his plans, which is a common practice in relationships to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend overreacted, but her feelings are valid. The author might not be the one initiating the boundaries, but he should have been more mindful of her feelings, especially knowing their past discussions. The fact that he didn't ask her about the sleepover is a key point. So, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he should have communicated better and considered her feelings, even if he didn't intend to cross any lines.\n"
