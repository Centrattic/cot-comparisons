One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not asking his girlfriend. The situation involves a friend, Annie, who came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out later and got upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was physically affectionate, which he didn't notice. Also, there's a history of joking about threesomes, where he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is whether having a sleepover with a friend in the same bed is a problem. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially because of the previous joke about threesomes. The user didn't think it was a big deal initially but now is hyper-aware and worried about the friendship.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, even though the user didn't initiate the sleepover, the context matters. Mentioning a friend as someone they'd have a threesome with, even in jest, could make the sleepover seem more significant. The girlfriend might feel that the user wasn't considerate of her feelings, as he didn't notice her discomfort in past interactions with Annie. Also, not informing her about the sleepover might have been a breach of communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't do anything intentional. He had a close friend over and didn't think to involve his girlfriend. The fact that he didn't initiate physical contact but just fell asleep might be a point in his favor. However, the combination of the previous joke about threesomes and the girlfriend's established boundaries could mean that the user should have been more mindful.\n\nThe question is whether the user is at fault. If the user had a history of discussions about threesomes and mentioned Annie in that context, even jokingly, then the sleepover with Annie might trigger the girlfriend's insecurities. The user's failure to recognize her past discomfort with Annie's behavior (like hand-holding) also shows a lack of awareness of his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user didn't communicate the sleepover to his girlfriend, which could be a point against him. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the girlfriend's feelings matter. The user's actions, while not malicious, might have been inconsiderate given the context.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely A (Yes, in the wrong) because the user should have been more attentive to his girlfriend's feelings and the context of their previous conversations about Annie. Even if unintentional, the combination of the sleepover and the past comments could have been hurtful, and better communication and awareness were needed.\n"
