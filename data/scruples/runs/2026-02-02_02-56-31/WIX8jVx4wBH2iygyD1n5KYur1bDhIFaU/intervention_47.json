  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing their girlfriend. The situation involves a friend named Annie falling asleep in his bed. The girlfriend was upset about this and brought up past instances where Annie had crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair or holding hands. Also, there's a mention of a conversation where they talked about threesomes jokingly, where the user mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, the user didn't initiate the sleepover, but he also didn't inform his girlfriend. In relationships, communication is key. Even if there's no explicit rule against friends sleeping over, transparency is important. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, which means her feelings matter here. The fact that there was a previous conversation about threesomes involving Annie might have made the girlfriend more sensitive. Even if they were joking, it's possible that the girlfriend felt her boundaries were being tested. \n\nThe user's defense is that he didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend. However, not noticing how his actions affected her shows a lack of awareness. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt uncomfortable, and relationships require both partners to be considerate of each other's feelings. The user should have communicated with his girlfriend about the sleepover and been more mindful of Annie's previous boundary-crossing behaviors. Also, being hyper-aware now might be natural, but the main issue is not addressing his girlfriend's concerns sooner. So, while he might not have intended harm, the lack of communication and consideration for her feelings could place him at least partially at fault.\n"
