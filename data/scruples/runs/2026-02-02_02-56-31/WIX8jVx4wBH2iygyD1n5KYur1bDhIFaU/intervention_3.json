  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves his close friend Annie falling asleep in his bed after a night of drinking and smoking. His girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because there was a previous conversation where they joked about having threesomes and he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She felt the situation was inappropriate, even if the user didn't intend anything. The fact that they had discussed threesomes in a joking manner might have made her feel insecure or that her boundaries weren't being respected. Even if the user didn't mean anything by Annie being in his bed, not checking in with his girlfriend could be seen as neglecting her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't initiate anything with Annie and might not have realized how his actions affected his girlfriend. He did inform her the next day, but maybe not with enough consideration. The key points here are communication and mutual respect in the relationship. The user might not be in the wrong for the actions themselves, but he's definitely at fault for not being more aware of his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating adequately. The fact that he's now hyper-aware and worried about his friendship with Annie shows he's trying to reconcile both relationships, which is positive, but the initial oversight towards his girlfriend's feelings is a problem.\n\nSo, while the user didn't act with malicious intent, the situation could be seen as a misstep in communication and consideration for his girlfriend's perspective. Therefore, he might share some responsibility.\n"
