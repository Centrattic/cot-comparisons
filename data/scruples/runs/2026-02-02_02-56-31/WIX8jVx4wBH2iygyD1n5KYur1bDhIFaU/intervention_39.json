One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user, a guy in a two-year relationship, had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie. His girlfriend found out and was upset, feeling that Annie's presence in his bed and past interactions were inappropriate. The key points here are about boundaries and communication in the relationship.\n\nFirst, the user didn't realize that his actions might be a problem. He mentions that Annie fell asleep in his bed after drinks and a party. But the girlfriend was upset because of previous instances where Annie's behavior made her uncomfortable, like holding hands or playing with hair. The user hadn't noticed these things, which might indicate he wasn't as in tune with her feelings as he should be.\n\nThe girlfriend's main issue seems to be that the user didn't consider her feelings, even though he didn't do anything intentionally wrong. Also, the fact that they had discussed hypothetical threesomes involving Annie in the past might have added to her insecurity. Even if those talks were casual, it could have made the current situation feel more significant to her.\n\nThe user is now feeling conflicted between his friend and his partner. The question is whether he's in the wrong. From an outsider's perspective, while the user didn't act with malice, he didn't take into account his girlfriend's potential discomfort. Relationships require communication and respecting each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort about Annie's behavior, the user should have been more cautious.\n\nBut in this case, the user didn't know she was upset about those past interactions until she pointed it out. There's a lack of communication on both sides. However, since the girlfriend did express her feelings after the incident, and the user now realizes he should have been more aware, the responsibility isn't entirely on him. That said, the act of having a friend sleep over in the same bed might be seen as crossing a line, even if unintentionally.\n\nConsidering all that, it's a bit of a gray area. The user might not be entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement in how he handled the situation. The answer likely leans towards A, but the nuances matter.\n"
