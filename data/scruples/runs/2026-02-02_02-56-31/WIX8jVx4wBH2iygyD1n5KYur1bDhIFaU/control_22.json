One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're at fault for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing their girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because the friend, Annie, was in the author's bed, and there were past instances where Annie might have overstepped, like holding hands or playing with hair when the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend, but the girlfriend brought up a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which might have fueled her insecurities.\n\nFirst, the sleepover part. The author and Annie had drinks and smoked before falling asleep in his room. The girlfriend wasn't there at the time. The author thought it was nothing wrong, but the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. The fact that they ended up in the same bed might be a red flag for the girlfriend, even if they didn't do anything. It's a common issue where people might not realize that their actions affect their partner's feelings, even if they're innocent.\n\nThen there's the history. The girlfriend mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding hands and playing with hair while the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't see those as issues because he didn't mean anything by them, but the girlfriend did. This shows a communication gap. The author might not have realized how these small actions made his girlfriend feel, which is a problem because partners need to be considerate of each other's feelings.\n\nThe threesomes conversation is another point. Even if they were joking, bringing up a specific friend in that context could make the girlfriend feel insecure. The author might not have realized the weight of that comment, leading to the girlfriend's current anger. This shows a lack of awareness about how casual comments can affect a partner's trust.\n\nNow, the author is struggling with his feelings towards his friend and fearing the friendship might change. He thinks the girlfriend overreacted. But from the girlfriend's perspective, the combination of past actions and the sleepover might make her feel neglected or insecure. The author's failure to communicate and consider her feelings is a key issue here.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate their boundaries and comfort levels. The author didn't consider how his actions, even if innocent, could make his girlfriend feel. Not informing her about the sleepover, even though she wasn't there, is a breach of communication. The fact that he thought nothing of it for days shows he didn't prioritize her feelings, which is part of the problem.\n\nSo, while the author might not have had bad intentions, his actions and lack of communication contributed to the girlfriend's distress. He's in the wrong for not being considerate of her feelings and for not setting clear boundaries to prevent misunderstandings.\n"
