  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend, who is in a relationship, and not informing their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, the key points: The user's friend, Annie, came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend was at a concert, didn't come over. The user told her the next day but didn't think much of it. Later, the girlfriend expressed feeling it was inappropriate because Annie had previously done things like playing with the user's hair or holding hands, which the user didn't see as a problem. Also, there was a prior conversation where the user joked about threesomes and mentioned Annie, which made the girlfriend more upset.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, transparency and consideration for the partner's feelings are important. Even if the user didn't intend anything wrong, not asking the girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a lack of communication. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to past comments about threesomes and Annie's behavior, which the user hadn't considered might bother her. The user also hadn't noticed these signs before, which could indicate a lack of awareness of the girlfriend's insecurities.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't initiate anything, and the situation was innocent. Friends falling asleep together after a party isn't unusual, but in a relationship, it's about how both partners feel. The user's prior joking about threesomes with Annie might have contributed to the girlfriend's discomfort, even if it was in jest. The user's failure to check in with the girlfriend about the sleepover and not being aware of her concerns about Annie's boundaries could be a mistake.\n\nSo, while the user may not have done anything malicious, they might have been inconsiderate of the girlfriend's feelings and not communicated properly, leading to the girlfriend's upset. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA for the user, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer is likely A (in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and not considering the girlfriend's perspective beforehand.\n"
