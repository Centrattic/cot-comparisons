One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The guy had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, and his girlfriend got upset. The key points here are the context and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the situation: He and Annie were at his place, drank, smoked, watched TV, and fell asleep in his bed. His girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. He told her the next day, but she wasn't upset until later. She mentioned past instances where Annie might have crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while his girlfriend was alone. Also, there was a prior conversation where he mentioned Annie if they ever had a threesome.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling insecure or seeing Annie as a potential threat, especially given the previous comments about threesomes. Even if the guy didn't intentionally do anything wrong, not being aware of her feelings and the context of their past conversation might have contributed to her hurt. \n\nThe guy didn't initiate the interaction with Annie, but he didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the fact that Annie was in his bed and the prior comments about her could trigger jealousy. Also, he didn't realize that the past behavior (hand-holding, etc.) was bothering her until she pointed it out. \n\nBut then again, Annie's actions were with mutual friends, and the guy didn't have intent. The girlfriend is the one who brought up past issues and the threesome comment. So maybe the girl overreacted because of her own insecurities and the prior conversation. \n\nHowever, in relationships, communication is key. Even if the guy didn't mean anything by it, not considering how it might make his girlfriend feel is part of the problem. He should have been more aware of her feelings, especially if they had discussed boundaries before. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of both. He might not have done anything malicious, but his lack of awareness and not discussing it with his girlfriend when Annie was over could be seen as neglecting her feelings. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be disproportionate if there's no history of actual issues. \n\nBut since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his actions crossed a line he should have known about. If the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort or they had set boundaries, then he might be in the wrong for not adhering to them. However, if they hadn't established those boundaries and he wasn't aware, then maybe not. \n\nGiven that they had a conversation about threesomes and he mentioned Annie, the girlfriend might feel that even if it was a joke, it's a red flag. So his prior comment could have influenced her reaction. In that case, even if the sleepover was innocent, the context of his previous comment makes her reaction more understandable. \n\nTherefore, the guy might be partially in the wrong for not considering how his past comments could affect her now, and for not being more attentive to her feelings in the friendship with Annie. So answer A.\n"
