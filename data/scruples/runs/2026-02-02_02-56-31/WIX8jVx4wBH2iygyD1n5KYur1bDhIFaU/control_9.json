One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his friend Annie and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the main points: The author and his friend Annie ended up sleeping in his bed after a night of drinking and smoking. The girlfriend found out later, got upset because she felt it was inappropriate, especially considering a past conversation where he mentioned wanting to have a threesome with Annie. The author didn't realize this bothered her until she brought it up.\n\nSo, from the girlfriend's perspective, she's upset because she feels the boundaries were crossed. Even though the author didn't initiate anything, the act of having a friend sleep in his bed might be seen as a breach of trust. The fact that they had discussed threesomes in the past adds another layer. The girlfriend might feel that the author's previous comments made the situation more concerning, even if he didn't act on them.\n\nOn the author's side, he claims he didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend. He didn't realize his actions were a problem until she pointed it out. He's also worried about his friendship with Annie now. \n\nBut here's the thing: in a relationship, communication is key. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as neglecting to respect her feelings. The girlfriend felt it was important enough to bring up serious concerns, which the author didn't notice. That might indicate a lack of communication or understanding on the author's part.\n\nThe key factors here are the girlfriend's feelings of being ignored or not considered in the decision to have the sleepover, and the previous conversation about threesomes, which might have made her more sensitive to the situation. The author's defense is that he didn't mean anything by it, but in relationships, intentions don't always override the impact on the partner.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, the fact that he didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend and didn't communicate about it could make him partially at fault. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her boundaries were violated, especially given the context of their past discussions. The author's unawareness might not make him entirely wrong, but it does show a lack of attention to her feelings, which is part of what the question is about. Therefore, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. However, since the options are A (yes) or B (no), and the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the girlfriend's valid concerns and his lack of communication, the answer is A.\n"
