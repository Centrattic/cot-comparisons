One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their friend Annie, a girl in her 20s, without asking his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset about it, even though he didn't initiate anything sexual. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were at a university, Annie came over to have drinks before a party. They ended up in the user's room watching TV and smoking, then fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert, and the user told her the next day. She was upset because of past incidents where Annie touched him in ways that might have been uncomfortable, like playing with his hair and holding his hand when the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there was a prior discussion where the user mentioned Annie in the context of possible threesomes, even if it was just joking.\n\nThe user feels the girlfriend overreacted, and he's worried about his friendship with Annie. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are key. Even if there was no intention, the girlfriend felt her boundaries were crossed. The fact that they had a conversation about threesomes and mentioned Annie might have made the girlfriend more sensitive. Even if it was a joke, bringing up specific friends can imply certain things. \n\nThe user didn't ask his girlfriend beforehand, which could be seen as not respecting her feelings. Even if the action itself (sleeping in the same bed) wasn't intended to be inappropriate, the girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt uncomfortable. In relationships, partners need to consider each other's feelings and boundaries. \n\nAlso, the user's friend Annie's past behaviors (like holding his hand when the girlfriend was nearby) might have contributed to the girlfriend's anxiety. The user might not have realized how those actions affected her, but it's important to acknowledge that.\n\nSo, while the user didn't do anything malicious, not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating about the sleepover could be seen as a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction is about her sense of security and trust in the relationship. Therefore, the user might be at fault for not being more mindful of her feelings and for the prior comments about Annie.\n"
