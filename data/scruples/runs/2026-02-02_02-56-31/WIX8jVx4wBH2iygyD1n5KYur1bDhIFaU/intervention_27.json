  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend (Annie) and not informing their girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user and Annie drank, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out the next morning. The user didn't think it was a big deal, but the girlfriend was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie had touched the user in ways she found uncomfortable, like playing with hair and holding hands. Also, the user had joked about having a threesome with Annie in the past.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the user didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, didn't consider her feelings about previous interactions with Annie, and there was a prior joke about a threesome. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be about boundaries and trust, which are important in a relationship. Even if the user didn't intend anything wrong, not communicating and being unaware of how his actions made his girlfriend feel could be seen as a mistake. The user is now affecting his friendship with Annie out of fear, which adds to the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue that he didn't do anything intentionally to harm the relationship. But the key here is about communication and being considerate of the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's concerns are valid because she felt hurt and needed to set boundaries. The user's lack of awareness and not discussing the past joke about threesomes could have contributed to her insecurity. So, even if the user didn't mean anything by the sleepover, not addressing the girlfriend's feelings and past comments makes him at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A, meaning he's in the wrong.\n"
