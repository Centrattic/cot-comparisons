One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a sleepover with their friend Annie, who is in a long-term relationship, and didn't ask their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset about it, and the author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and Annie were hanging out, had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in the author's room. The girlfriend found out the next day and was upset. The author didn't think much of it initially. The girlfriend mentioned past instances where Annie was affectionate towards the author, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. Also, there was a conversation where the author mentioned preferring Annie for a threesome, which the girlfriend points out as a possible reason for her reaction.\n\nNow, from a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author didn't consider that their actions might make the girlfriend uncomfortable. Even if there wasn't any intention to be inappropriate, not discussing the sleepover could be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's feelings. The fact that the author had previously mentioned Annie in a threesome context might have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind. Even if it was a joke, it's important to be mindful of how such comments can affect a partner.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling that the author didn't notice her boundaries. The author might be in the wrong for not being aware of how their actions and past comments could be perceived. The friendship with Annie is important, but in a relationship, both partners need to be comfortable with each other's interactions with others. If the author's friend is in a relationship, that might add another layer, as it could be seen as crossing a line even if unintended.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover, and it's mentioned that they fell asleep together without planning. But still, in relationships, sometimes even unintentional actions can cause hurt. The key issue here is the lack of communication. The author didn't check in with the girlfriend about the sleepover or consider her feelings in the past interactions with Annie.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author didn't mean any harm, the fact that their actions made the girlfriend uncomfortable and that they had previous comments about threesomes with Annie might mean that they were negligent in considering her perspective. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being attentive to the girlfriend's boundaries and not communicating properly.\n"
