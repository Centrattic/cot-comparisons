One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend Annie came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in the author's bed. The author didn't tell his girlfriend until the next day. The girlfriend was upset because she felt this was inappropriate, especially since they had joked about threesomes before and the author had mentioned Annie. \n\nThe girlfriend's main points are about boundaries and past jokes. The author didn't intend anything, but the girlfriend felt hurt. Now, the author is conflicted, thinking maybe the girlfriend overreacted, but also worried about affecting his friendship with Annie.\n\nKey factors here: \n1. The girlfriend is in a long-term relationship, so she might have felt jealousy or insecurity.\n2. The author didn't think to inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might be a breach of communication, even if unintentional.\n3. The past jokes about threesomes could have set a context where the girlfriend felt the author was open to such things, making the situation more sensitive.\n4. The author didn't initiate the sleepover, but he didn't check in with his girlfriend either. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on communication and respect for the girlfriend's feelings. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not considering her perspective and not communicating could be seen as a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt uncomfortable, and the author's failure to notice her concerns might indicate a lack of awareness in the relationship. \n\nBut is he actually in the wrong? If the relationship had agreed that communication is important, then the author's failure to inform her might be a problem. However, if both parties had different expectations, it's more about differing perspectives. The mention of past jokes adds another layer, making the situation more sensitive. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal or moral sense, he might be in the wrong in the context of their relationship if the girlfriend felt it was a boundary that needed respect. The answer likely leans towards A (Yes) because the author's actions, though not malicious, caused hurt and the lack of communication is a mistake.\n"
