One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing their girlfriend. The context is a relationship where the girlfriend felt upset about the situation, especially after past comments about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. The author's friend, Annie, came over, they ended up in the author's room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't informed. The next day, the author mentioned it but didn't think much of it. The girlfriend later confronted him, feeling it was inappropriate. She also brought up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The author hadn't noticed these bothered her.\n\nThe key here is communication and boundaries in the relationship. The girlfriend felt the sleepover was a problem, especially since they had discussed threesomes before, with the author mentioning Annie. That might have led to her insecurities or feeling her boundaries were violated. The author didn't see an issue, thinking he did nothing wrong, but maybe didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings enough.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't intend harm, but in relationships, intentions don't always matter as much as how actions affect the partner. The girlfriend felt upset, and the author didn't communicate with her before the sleepover. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the lack of transparency could be a problem. Also, the past comments about threesomes with Annie might have made the situation more sensitive for the girlfriend. The author's failure to notice her discomfort in previous interactions also plays a role here.\n\nBut then, the author didn't initiate anything with Annie. He was just sleeping with a friend. The girlfriend's reaction might be overblown if there was no actual infidelity or intent to hurt. However, in relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The fact that the author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust, even if unintentional. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt her boundaries were crossed, not because of the sleepover itself, but due to the lack of communication and previous comments.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Maybe not in the action itself, but in the communication aspect. He should have discussed the sleepover with his girlfriend first, even if it seemed harmless. The girlfriend's reaction is partly due to the context of past comments, which adds to her insecurity. The author needs to consider her feelings and improve communication. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be blowing it out of proportion if there was no actual wrongdoing. But in relationships, perception matters. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance where communication could have been better.\n"
