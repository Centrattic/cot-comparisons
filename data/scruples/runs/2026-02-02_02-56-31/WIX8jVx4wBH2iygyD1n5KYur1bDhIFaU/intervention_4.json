  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing their girlfriend. The situation is that the friend, Annie, came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out and is upset, especially because of previous instances where Annie's actions were seen as crossing boundaries. Also, there was a conversation about threesomes where the user mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend is bringing up now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user didn't intend to do anything wrong and didn't initiate the situation. However, the girlfriend is feeling insecure because of past behaviors and the mention of threesomes. The user is now worried about their friendship with Annie changing.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the user didn't mean to do anything wrong, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The fact that they didn't inform their girlfriend about the sleepover is a point of contention. Also, the previous conversation about threesomes with Annie might have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind, making her react more strongly to the situation.\n\nBut the user's intention wasn't malicious. They didn't have any romantic or sexual interaction with Annie. However, not checking in with their girlfriend about such a situation could be seen as a lack of consideration for her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction, while maybe intense, is a reflection of her insecurities and past experiences with Annie.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. While they didn't do anything intentionally, the lack of communication and not considering how their actions might affect their girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a mistake. However, it's also possible that the girlfriend is overreacting, especially if there's no history of similar issues leading up to this.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the sleepover. They were watching TV, had a few drinks, smoked, and fell asleep. There's no indication of inappropriate behavior beyond sharing a bed. The girlfriend's issue seems more about the potential for such a situation rather than an actual transgression. The mention of the threesome conversation is key here because it's a past comment that could be influencing her current reaction.\n\nIn conclusion, the user might not be in the wrong for the actions themselves but could be in the wrong for not being more considerate of their girlfriend's feelings and not communicating better. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also influenced by past interactions that the user might not have realized were problematic. It's a mix of both parties' perspectives, but the user's responsibility lies in ensuring their actions don't inadvertently cause harm to their partner's feelings.\n"
