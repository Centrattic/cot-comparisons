One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend got upset about it. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author and his friend Annie were having drinks and ended up falling asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned that Annie had other instances where she might have overstepped, like playing with his hair or holding his hand at a festival. The key point is that the girlfriend felt uncomfortable because of these actions, even though the author didn't intend anything wrong. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend brought up as a reason for her feelings.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but the girlfriend's reaction is based on her feelings of being overlooked and the potential for boundaries being crossed. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly and he mentioned Annie might have planted seeds of insecurity. Even if the author didn't mean anything by Annie's actions, not being aware of how his girlfriend felt is a problem. Relationships require communication and consideration of each other's feelings. The author should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's perspective and maybe discussed the situation with her before Annie stayed over. So, even though he didn't act with ill intent, his lack of awareness and communication could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I need to check if there's a strong case for B. Alternatively, if the author had no intention to hurt, maybe B. Hmm.\n"
