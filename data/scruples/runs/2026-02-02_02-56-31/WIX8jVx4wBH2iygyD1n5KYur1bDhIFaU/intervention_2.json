  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with his friend Annie and not telling his girlfriend. The situation is that Annie came over, had drinks, smoked, and fell asleep in his bed. His girlfriend found out later and felt it was inappropriate, especially since they had joked about potential threesomes and he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: He didn't do anything malicious, but he didn't inform his girlfriend. Even though he didn't initiate anything, the fact that a friend slept in his bed might be a red flag for some people. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling insecure and not being communicated with. The user didn't consider her feelings here, which is a mistake in a relationship where communication is key.\n\nThen there's the history of joking about threesomes and mentioning Annie. Even if it's not serious, bringing up specific friends in that context can make a partner feel uneasy. The girlfriend's past observations (like Annie playing with his hair) also show that she was already concerned about boundaries. The user didn't notice these signs, which shows a lack of awareness of her feelings.\n\nSo, while the user didn't intend to do anything wrong, the lack of communication and not being attentive to his girlfriend's previous concerns might make him at least partially responsible. The answer here would lean towards A, but maybe not entirely. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the girlfriend's perspective and the importance of communication in relationships, even if the action wasn't malicious, the oversight in communication is a mistake. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
