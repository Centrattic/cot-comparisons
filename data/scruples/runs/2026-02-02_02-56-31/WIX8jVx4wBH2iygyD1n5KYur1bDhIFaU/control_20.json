One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The author had a friend, Annie, over for drinks before a party. They ended up watching TV in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was affectionate towards the author, and she was upset because they had joked about threesomes before, with the author mentioning Annie. \n\nSo, the key points here. The author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but maybe he was careless. The girlfriend feels her boundaries were crossed, even if he didn't mean to. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly might have made her more sensitive. Also, the author didn't consider her feelings when Annie was over. Even if the sleepover wasn't intentional, not informing the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't initiate anything. He just thought it was a normal sleepover. The problem is that the girlfriend felt uncomfortable, and the author didn't realize the impact of his actions. The fact that they had previous jokes about threesomes might have contributed to her insecurity. So, while he didn't do anything malicious, he might have ignored her potential concerns. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could have prevented the issue. Even if it was accidental, not being aware of her feelings is a problem. So, he's not entirely in the wrong because he didn't act with malice, but he didn't consider her perspective. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid because her trust was shaken. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because, even though he didn't intend to hurt her, he failed to communicate and consider her feelings, which led to her discomfort. The key is the lack of communication and awareness of her boundaries.\n"
