  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For having a sleepover with my (21M) friend (22F) and not asking my girlfriend (20F)?\nTitle is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend while not informing their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset because the friend, Annie, had previously crossed boundaries like holding hands and playing with hair, and there was a past conversation where they joked about threesomes involving Annie.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the girlfriend's emotional response. Even though the user didn't have intentions, the act of a friend sleeping in their bed can feel like a boundary was crossed. The girlfriend mentioned that the sleepover plus previous behaviors made her uncomfortable, especially given the threesome joke. She's pointing out that the user didn't notice her being bothered before, which is valid. Trust and communication are key in relationships. The user might not have done anything malicious, but they didn't consider how their actions affected the girlfriend. The fact that they had discussed the friend in a sexual context, even jokingly, might have added to her insecurity. \n\nNow, the user feels guilty about affecting their friendship with Annie, but the girlfriend's feelings are also important. The user might not be in the wrong for the sleepover itself, but they did overlook the girlfriend's emotional state. They didn't ask for permission or check in with her, which is a common issue in relationships where one partner's needs are prioritized over the other's. So, even if the user didn't mean to hurt her, they should have been more mindful. The answer is probably A (in the wrong) because they failed to communicate and consider their girlfriend's feelings, even if the action itself wasn't malicious.\n"
