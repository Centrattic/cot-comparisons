I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, and for expressing how ASMR makes them feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine of watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disruptive. The author has misophonia when it comes to whispering in ASMR, causing them anxiety and discomfort. They've shown a study to the boyfriend, who then used earphones.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author is expressing their needs and setting boundaries, which is generally healthy in a relationship. They're not being aggressive, just asking for adjustments. The boyfriend's reaction was to use earphones, which suggests he's making an effort. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author isn't forbidding all activities but is asking for adjustments to accommodate both parties' needs. Since they moved in together, they should be negotiating living arrangements. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have a medical/psychological reason (misophonia) for their discomfort. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" might be making him resistant, but the author is justified in prioritizing their well-being. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
