I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop habits when they're trying to sleep. The situation is that the boyfriend uses his laptop at night, sometimes with ASMR that includes whispering, which the author has misophonia for. The author tells him to turn down the sound and brightness, and shows him a study about misophonia and ASMR. The boyfriend's reaction is to roll away and put in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is clearly in a situation where their health and well-being are affected. Misophonia can be a real issue, causing anxiety and discomfort. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is important in a relationship. They're not just being finicky; they have a specific sensitivity that's causing them distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine. Moving in together means both people have to compromise. The boyfriend might feel that his habits are being restricted, but he's accommodating by using earphones when he sees the study. However, if he's not doing it consistently, maybe there's a disconnect in communication. The author is explaining their needs and providing evidence, which seems reasonable. \n\nThe key points are: the author's health issue (misophonia), communication of needs, and the boyfriend's response. The boyfriend isn't completely uncooperative since he uses earphones after seeing the study, but maybe he's not doing it every time. The author's actions seem justified because they're advocating for their own well-being. The boyfriend might need to be more proactive in using earphones all the time, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're addressing a legitimate issue and trying to find a solution. The boyfriend's reaction might be a bit defensive, but the author's actions are reasonable.\n"
