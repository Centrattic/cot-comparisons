  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend and the author just moved in together. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop with some sounds and brightness, which the author finds disturbing. The author keeps asking him to lower the volume, adjust the brightness, and avoid certain types of ASMR, like whispering, which causes her anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their cohabitation. When two people live together, especially in a romantic relationship, they generally need to accommodate each other's needs. The author is clearly communicating her needs and the impact of his actions on her well-being. She even provided a study explaining her reaction, which seems like a reasonable step to help him understand her perspective. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is to put on earphones, which is a respectful way to comply without causing her distress. That suggests he's trying to respect her boundaries. The author is seeking a peaceful sleep environment, which is a basic need. The boyfriend's activities, while a personal preference, are affecting her physical and mental health. \n\nMisophonia, especially to specific sounds like whispering, is a real condition. The fact that she has a documented study supports her claim that it's not just a personal dislike but a genuine issue. It's reasonable for her to ask for adjustments when they live together in close quarters. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the boyfriend has his own needs and preferences. However, since they are in a committed relationship and sharing a living space, mutual adjustments are expected. The author isn't forbidding him from doing these things entirely but is asking for modifications that don't interfere with her well-being. \n\nThe key points here are communication, mutual respect, and the impact on health. The author is not being inconsiderate; she's advocating for her needs in a respectful way. The boyfriend's willingness to comply (using earphones) shows he's responsive. Therefore, it seems the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
