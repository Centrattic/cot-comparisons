I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They moved in together, and they have different bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness, and listens to ASMR, especially whispering ones. The author has misophonia regarding whispering, which causes anxiety and discomfort.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect in a relationship and the balance between personal needs and the partner's habits. The author is communicating their discomfort, which is important. They provided a study to explain their sensitivity, which shows they're trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and using earphones\u2014suggests he's making an effort to accommodate.\n\nHowever, the author is repeatedly asking for adjustments. The question is whether this is reasonable. Since the author has a medical condition (misophonia) affecting their well-being, their requests are valid. The boyfriend's habits impact the author's health, so it's reasonable for them to ask for changes. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure isn't a valid excuse if it's harming the author's sleep and mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs are also important. But in a shared living situation, especially when one person's health is at stake, accommodations should be made. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're setting boundaries for their well-being. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to use earphones after being shown the study indicates he's willing to adapt.\n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole here. They're advocating for their health and making reasonable requests, which the boyfriend is partially complying with. The answer should be B (No).\n"
