I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness on while they're trying to sleep. The author asks him to turn it down and mentions feeling anxious and trapped by ASMR, which the boyfriend likes. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to get a good night's sleep and has specific needs for silence and darkness. They've communicated this to their partner. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine which he's used to. The author's requests are about adjusting the environment to meet their needs, which is reasonable. Misophonia is a real condition, and the author has explained their discomfort, even showing a study. The boyfriend's reaction of putting in earphones suggests he's trying to accommodate.\n\nBut I should check if the author is being too demanding. Moving in together means both need to compromise. If the author is making constant requests every night, maybe there's a need for a middle ground. However, the author's health and well-being are important. They're not forbidding him from doing these things entirely but asking for adjustments that allow them to sleep. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to put on earphones shows he's willing to comply, so the author's requests seem valid.\n\nAlso, the author isn't saying he can't do it at all, just not in their presence. Maybe using headphones or moving to another room if possible. The key point is communication and mutual accommodation. The author isn't in the wrong for advocating their needs, especially when they've explained the health impact. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
