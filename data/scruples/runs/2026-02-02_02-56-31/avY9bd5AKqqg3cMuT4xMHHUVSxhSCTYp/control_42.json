I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening during bedtime. The key points here are about shared living space and mutual respect.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they need silence and darkness for their bedtime routine, which the boyfriend's habits interfere with. They've tried to communicate this, and the boyfriend has responded by using earphones after being shown a study about misophonia and ASMR. That seems like a reasonable accommodation.\n\nThe boyfriend's habits are his personal preference, but when they affect the partner's sleep and well-being, there's a need for compromise. The author is setting boundaries, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend isn't being forced to stop entirely; just to adjust when the author is trying to sleep. \n\nThe study mentioned supports the author's feelings, showing it's not just personal dislike but a recognized issue. The boyfriend's reaction (using earphones) suggests he respects her needs. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They're asking for adjustments that don't completely take away the boyfriend's habits, just modify them during specific times. \n\nSo, considering the context, communication efforts, and the boyfriend's willingness to accommodate, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
