  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use when they're trying to sleep. They mention needing silence and darkness, while he uses YouTube, ASMR, or other laptop activities. The user says they let him watch but end up asking to turn it down every night. He doesn't seem happy about it. The main issue is the ASMR with whispering, which the user has misophonia for.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has valid needs for their sleep and mental health. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause discomfort. They even showed research to their boyfriend, which he took action by using earphones. That suggests he at least tried to comply.\n\nOn the other hand, moving in together often requires compromise. The boyfriend might feel his relaxation method is being restricted. But the user isn't outright banning his activity, just asking for adjustments that accommodate their sensitivity. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he's making an effort, but maybe not enough.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. They're not being unreasonable; they have specific needs, and they've communicated them. The boyfriend's pleasure (ASMR) is causing the user distress. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The user isn't saying he can't do it at all, just during their bedtime. So, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong), but maybe there's a middle ground they need to find. However, the user hasn't done anything wrong by standing up for their needs. The boyfriend should adapt to some extent for their partner's well-being.\n"
