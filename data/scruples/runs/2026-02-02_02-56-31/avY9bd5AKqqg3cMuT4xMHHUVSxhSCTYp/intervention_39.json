  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage at night because it's affecting their sleep. They mention having misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I should consider their reasoning. They moved in together and were aware of the potential issue. They've tried to communicate their needs, showing a study to explain their reaction. It seems they're making a valid request based on their health and comfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his preferences are being restricted. But the user isn't banning all sounds; they're specifically asking about the ASMR that triggers them. They're compromising by allowing other background noises but need the specific triggers addressed. \n\nCommunication is key here. The user has explained their feelings and provided evidence, which is commendable. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) suggests he's respecting their request. The user's actions are about their well-being, which is important. \n\nI don't see any signs that the user is being unreasonable. They're setting boundaries for a legitimate health issue. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
