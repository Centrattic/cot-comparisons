I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds annoying, especially the whispering parts. The author mentions having misophonia related to whispering and showed the boyfriend a study about it. The boyfriend then put in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for silence and darkness to sleep, which is important for their well-being. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has his own preferences for winding down. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable in their requests. Since the author explained their condition (misophonia) and provided a study, it seems they're trying to communicate their needs clearly. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) suggests he's making an effort to accommodate. However, the author is repeatedly asking for adjustments, which might be frustrating for the boyfriend. But given the health aspect (misophonia can be a real issue causing anxiety), the author's actions seem justified. The question is whether it's reasonable to expect some accommodation in a shared living space. Since they moved in together, both should have discussed these needs beforehand. The author isn't being malicious, just trying to get their needs met. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
