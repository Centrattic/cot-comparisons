I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage during bedtime. The boyfriend's habits\u2014like watching YouTube or ASMR\u2014interfere with the user's need for silence and darkness to sleep. The user mentions having misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They provided a study to him, and he reacted by using earphones.\n\nFirst, consider mutual respect in a relationship. It's reasonable for both partners to have different needs. The user isn't demanding a complete change but rather adjustments like lowering volume or brightness. They're also communicating their feelings, which is healthy. The boyfriend's reaction (using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate. However, maybe there's room for compromise. For example, using a white noise machine or earplugs might help both sides. But the user isn't in the wrong for advocating for their well-being. Misophonia is a real condition, and ASMR's effect varies. The key is balance\u2014both should work together to find a solution. The user isn't being unreasonable; they're expressing valid needs. The boyfriend's guilt about his habits might affect his willingness to change, but it's a two-way street. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
