I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness on at night, which disrupts the author's sleep. The author has tried to communicate their discomfort, especially regarding ASMR with whispering, which triggers misophonia. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy with these requests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is asking their partner to adjust his habits to accommodate their sleep needs. They've provided context about needing silence and darkness, which is a legitimate issue. Misophonia is a real condition, and the author has shared research about it, which shows they're trying to explain their sensitivity, not just being picky. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away, using earphones) might indicate he's trying to comply, but maybe not optimally.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're advocating for their own needs, which is reasonable. However, the frequency of their requests might be a factor. If they're constantly asking and it's affecting the boyfriend's comfort, there might be a balance issue. But given that the author has a medical condition (misophonia) and the boyfriend moved in together, it's about mutual adjustment. The boyfriend could be asked to use headphones, or maybe they could find a solution like sleeping in different rooms temporarily while they work on compromises. However, the author isn't being unreasonable here; they're trying to communicate their needs and have a valid medical reason. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but that shouldn't override the other person's health and well-being. So, the answer would be B, the author is not the asshole. They're trying to manage their condition and sleep needs, and it's important to respect that. The boyfriend needs to find ways to enjoy his ASMR without disturbing the author, perhaps by using headphones or adjusting his setup. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries for their health.\n"
