  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when she's trying to sleep. She also mentions that ASMR, especially whispering, makes her anxious. They just moved in together, so maybe there's some adjustment period here.\n\nFirst, she's communicating her needs, which is important. She's not just keeping quiet but trying to find a solution. He's trying to adjust by using earphones after she showed him the study, which is good. But maybe the user is being too demanding? Or is it reasonable to expect a partner to accommodate such needs?\n\nMisophonia is a real condition, so if she has that, then her reaction to whispering ASMR isn't just a preference. That adds context. She's explaining her feelings, which shows she's trying to be understanding. He's responding by rolling over and using earphones, which is a compromise. \n\nBut she's asking him to change his bedtime routine every night. Maybe there's a middle ground. Like, if he uses earphones consistently from the start, maybe she wouldn't have to ask every night. But the issue is that he might not always remember, and she's the one having to remind him. \n\nIs it her responsibility to keep reminding him, or should he take the initiative once he knows? Since he's shown willingness to adjust (using earphones after seeing the study), maybe she's not in the wrong. But maybe she could be more flexible. However, her need for silence and darkness is valid. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She's communicating her needs, and he's trying to adjust. So she's probably not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No). But need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. Like, if she's being overly controlling, but given the context of her health (misophonia), it's reasonable.\n"
