I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening habits during bedtime. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they need silence and darkness to sleep, which is their normal routine. They've moved in together, so there's a new shared living situation. The boyfriend's routine involves using his laptop, which is causing disturbances. The author is asking him to turn down the volume, lower brightness, etc. That seems reasonable because they need their environment to sleep.\n\nThen there's the ASMR issue. The author has misophonia, specifically to whispering. They explained this with a study, and the boyfriend reacted by putting in earphones. The author is worried about being an asshole for setting these boundaries. \n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he might feel his habits are being restricted. But the author has a legitimate health reason (misophonia) for their discomfort. They communicated their issue and provided evidence, which shows they're trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to use earphones suggests he respects her needs. \n\nIs it fair for the author to ask for these adjustments? Since they made their needs known and the boyfriend is accommodating, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their health and well-being, which is important. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but the author's needs take precedence in their shared space, especially when it's affecting sleep and mental health. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
