  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening when she's trying to sleep. She has misophonia, which makes her uncomfortable with whispering ASMR. They just moved in together, so boundaries are still being set.\n\nFirst, she's communicating her needs, which is important. She's not just complaining but explaining why it affects her negatively, even showing a study. That shows she's trying to be understanding and not just being inconsiderate. \n\nHer boyfriend's habits are part of his bedtime routine, which is valid, but she has legitimate health issues (misophonia) that make this a problem. It's reasonable to ask for adjustments for shared living. However, he might feel his needs aren't being respected, especially if she's constantly reminding him. But given her condition, it's not unreasonable to request accommodations, just like she might expect him to adjust for her need for silence and darkness.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect and compromise. She's trying to set boundaries for her well-being, which is important. If he's immediately rolling away when she explains the study, maybe he's also making an effort. But the question is about her being in the wrong. Since she's communicating her needs and has a valid reason, she's probably not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
