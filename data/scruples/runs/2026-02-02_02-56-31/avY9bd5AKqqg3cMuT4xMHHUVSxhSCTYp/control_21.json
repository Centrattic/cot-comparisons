I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening habits during bedtime.\n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be the author's sensitivity to certain sounds, like whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety. They mention having misophonia, which is a real condition. The boyfriend's routine includes using his laptop with sound and brightness, which disrupts the author's need for silence and darkness.\n\nThe author has tried to communicate their discomfort and even showed research about misophonia and ASMR. The boyfriend responded by using earphones, which is a positive step. However, the author continues to ask for adjustments regularly. \n\nNow, considering the context: moving in together often requires compromise. The author is setting boundaries for their well-being, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling over, using earphones) suggests he's making an effort. However, the question is whether the author's requests are excessive.\n\nThe key points are: the author has a valid health reason (misophonia), they've communicated it clearly, and the boyfriend is trying to accommodate. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're addressing a legitimate issue. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" might indicate some internal conflict, but the author's need for a restful environment takes precedence here.\n\nPossible counterarguments: maybe the author isn't considering the boyfriend's needs too much. But the problem arises from the author's specific health condition, which is a strong justification. The boyfriend's adjustment (earphones) helps, but the author still needs to ask frequently, which is understandable given the sensitivity.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and well-being in a shared living space. Both parties need to find a balance, but the author's actions are justified.\n"
