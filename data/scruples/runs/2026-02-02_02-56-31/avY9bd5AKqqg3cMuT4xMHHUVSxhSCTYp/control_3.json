  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep, but the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author has misophonia to, especially the whispering part. The author asks him to turn down the volume and brightness, but the boyfriend doesn't like it. The author showed him a study about misophonia, and he put in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to maintain their sleep environment, which is important for health. Misophonia is a real condition, so the author's reaction to ASMR is valid. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own preferences and might feel his needs aren't being respected. However, the author is making reasonable requests to coexist in a shared space. Since they live together, especially sharing a room, adjusting for each other is necessary. The author is not being unreasonable by asking for changes that don't completely take away the boyfriend's habit but just modify it. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply after learning about the author's condition. The key is whether the author's requests are excessive. Since they are accommodating the boyfriend's routine as much as possible while addressing their own needs, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
