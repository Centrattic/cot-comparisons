I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, their needs are clear: they require silence and darkness for sleep. The boyfriend's habits include using his laptop with sound and brightness, which he's done as part of his bedtime routine. When they moved in together, the conflict arose because his habits disrupt her sleep.\n\nShe's communicating her needs by asking him to turn down the sound, brightness, etc., and explaining how ASMR makes her feel. She mentions misophonia related to whispering, which is a known condition. She even showed him a study to help him understand her reaction.\n\nHe responds by rolling away and using earphones, which suggests he's making an effort to accommodate her. However, she feels he doesn't like being asked, leading to tension. \n\nKey points: She's being upfront about her needs, he's making some changes, but she's concerned about his feelings. The question is whether she's overstepping. \n\nMisophonia is a real issue, and advocating for one's health is valid. Since they live together, mutual adjustments are necessary. She's not being unreasonable by setting boundaries for her well-being. His reaction might be about personal habits, but her health and sleep are important. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's communicating her needs and making necessary adjustments for her comfort, which is reasonable in a shared living situation.\n"
