  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop settings and ASMR habits when they're trying to sleep. They mention they need silence and darkness, while he prefers to watch YouTube or listen to ASMR, which they find irritating, especially the whispering parts. They've shown him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he responds by putting in earphones.\n\nSo, the user is concerned they're being too strict. Let me break this down. First, they moved in together, which means shared living spaces. They've communicated their needs and boundaries, which is important. The boyfriend is adjusting by using earphones, which suggests he's trying to accommodate. The user has a legitimate sensitivity to certain sounds, which they've explained with a study, so that's not just a personal preference. They're not stopping him entirely but asking for adjustments to make their shared space comfortable for both. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual adjustment. The user isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries for their own well-being. The boyfriend's willingness to use earphones shows he's respecting those boundaries. If the user didn't communicate their needs, then maybe there's a problem, but they clearly have. So, the answer is likely B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
