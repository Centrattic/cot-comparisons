I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening during bedtime. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they moved in together and have different bedtime routines. The boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and bright screen, which the author finds disruptive. The author has to ask him repeatedly to lower the volume, brightness, etc. This is leading to some conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the author's health issues. They mention misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They even showed a study about it to the boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction was to use earphones, which seems like a reasonable compromise.\n\nNow, considering that misophonia is a real condition, and the author is clearly affected, their requests are about their well-being. The boyfriend might be used to his routine, but moving in together means both need to adjust. The author isn't just being picky; they have a legitimate reason to ask for changes. The boyfriend's use of earphones shows he's trying to accommodate, so the author isn't being unreasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
