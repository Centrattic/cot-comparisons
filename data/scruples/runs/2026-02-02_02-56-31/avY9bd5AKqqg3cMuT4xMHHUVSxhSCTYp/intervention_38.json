  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine to accommodate their need for silence and darkness. They have misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. The boyfriend's routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the user finds disruptive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative emotions. The user has shown a study to their partner, which he then reacted to by using earphones. That suggests he's sensitive to their feelings. However, the user is consistently asking for adjustments. \n\nThe question is whether they're being reasonable. Since they moved in together, both need to compromise. The user has a valid health reason for their request. The boyfriend might have his own needs, but if the user's condition is causing significant distress, it's reasonable to adjust. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is being asked every night and feels it's too much, maybe there's a middle ground. But the user isn't being inconsiderate; they're explaining their medical condition. So the answer is likely B, No, they're not in the wrong.\n"
