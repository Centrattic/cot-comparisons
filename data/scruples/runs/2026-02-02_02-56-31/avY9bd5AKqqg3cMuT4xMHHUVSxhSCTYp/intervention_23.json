  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR watching when they're trying to sleep. They mention they have misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious. They've shown research to their boyfriend, but he seems to be rolling away and using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user and their partner just moved in together, so establishing boundaries is important. The user's need for silence and darkness is valid for their sleep. Misophonia is a real condition that can cause significant distress, so the user's sensitivity to certain sounds isn't just pickiness. They've communicated their needs and even provided evidence of their condition, which is a responsible approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's bedtime routine involves activities that he enjoys. It's possible he's not used to having someone else's needs affect his habits. However, since they live together, mutual adjustments are necessary. The user isn't asking for complete abstinence from ASMR; just adjustments during the user's sleep time. That seems reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe not in a way that's satisfactory to the user.\n\nThe key points here are communication, mutual respect, and finding a compromise. The user has communicated their needs clearly and provided context about their condition. It's not about being a burden but about cohabitation requiring both parties to adapt. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure (ASMR) is something he can mitigate by using headphones or adjusting the brightness, which are minimal changes. The user isn't in the wrong for advocating for their health and well-being. However, maybe there's a need for further discussion to ensure both feel heard and respected. But based on the information given, the user isn't the asshole.\n"
