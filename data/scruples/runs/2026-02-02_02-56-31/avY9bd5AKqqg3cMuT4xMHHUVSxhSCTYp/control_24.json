I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR habits when they're trying to sleep.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they need silence and darkness at bedtime, which is their personal preference. The boyfriend, on the other hand, uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author has misophonia towards, especially with whispering. They've communicated their discomfort, shown a study, and the boyfriend responded by putting in earphones. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual adjustment. The author has expressed their needs clearly and provided education on their condition. The boyfriend took steps to accommodate, like using earphones. The author isn't asking for complete abandonment of the boyfriend's routine but adjustments to minimize disturbance. \n\nIt's about finding a balance where both partners can coexist. Since the author has made their needs known and the boyfriend is making efforts, it doesn't seem like the author is being unreasonable. The boyfriend's actions (putting in earphones) suggest he respects her needs. The author isn't overstepping; they're advocating for their well-being. No one should have to endure something that makes them uncomfortable if it's possible to adjust. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
