I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially because the boyfriend listens to ASMR, which the author has a misophonia reaction to.\n\nFirst, I need to understand misophonia. From what I know, misophonia is a condition where certain sounds trigger strong emotional or physiological responses. The author mentions feeling anxious, trapped, and irritated by whispering ASMR. They even found a study linking misophonia and ASMR reactions, which they showed to their boyfriend. So that's a legitimate health issue.\n\nThe boyfriend's bedtime routine is to watch YouTube or listen to ASMR. The author is asking him to adjust the volume, brightness, maybe use earphones, etc. The boyfriend seems to comply when asked, like putting in earphones after the study was shown. But the author keeps feeling like they're in the wrong for making these requests.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for setting these boundaries. Well, in a relationship, especially when living together, communication and mutual respect are key. The author is trying to communicate their needs because they have a medical condition. It's reasonable to ask their partner to accommodate that. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away, using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe there's some frustration on his side as well.\n\nHowever, the author is being consistent in their requests. They didn't just ask once but every night. The boyfriend might feel it's an ongoing annoyance. But considering the health aspect, the author isn't being unreasonable. They're not asking to stop using the laptop entirely but to adjust the volume and brightness. The boyfriend could use headphones, which seems like a simple solution. The author isn't trying to control him but to protect their well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is also trying to wind down with ASMR and it's part of his routine, maybe there's a balance needed. But given the medical issue, the author's needs should take precedence. The key here is that the author is explaining their condition and working with the boyfriend to find solutions. The boyfriend's compliance shows he's trying to meet their needs.\n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole here. They're advocating for their health and trying to coexist. The boyfriend might have some valid feelings about his own routine, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
