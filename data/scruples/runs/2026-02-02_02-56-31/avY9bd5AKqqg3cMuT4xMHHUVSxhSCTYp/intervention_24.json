  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're the asshole for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine when it's affecting their sleep.\n\nFirst, they mention they have misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They provided a study to their boyfriend, who then used earphones. That shows they tried to explain the issue and he made a change. \n\nThey moved in together, so bedtimes and routines are a common adjustment period. The user needs silence and darkness, which is their basic need for rest. The boyfriend's activities, while his preference, interfere with that. The user is asking him to adjust, which is reasonable because it's affecting their well-being. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he tried to accommodate. However, maybe the user is frustrated if he's not consistently following through. But the user isn't being unreasonable here. They're setting boundaries for their health. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition, so the user's feelings are valid. It's not about right or wrong in a general sense, but about mutual respect in a shared living space. The user is seeking a compromise, which is necessary in a relationship. \n\nSo, the answer is B, No. They're not in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their health and well-being, especially after explaining the issue and giving examples.\n"
