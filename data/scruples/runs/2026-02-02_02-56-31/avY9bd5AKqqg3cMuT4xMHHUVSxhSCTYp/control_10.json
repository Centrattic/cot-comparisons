I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness on at night, which disturbs her sleep. She has a specific issue with ASMR, especially whispering, due to misophonia. She's been asking him to adjust his setup, and he's been doing that after she explains her feelings. Now, she's wondering if she's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for wanting a quiet and dark environment. Misophonia is a real condition, and the study she showed him probably helped him understand her discomfort. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he enjoys. Moving in together often requires compromises, and it's possible he's making adjustments to accommodate her, like using earphones after she explains the issue.\n\nThe key points here are that the author has communicated her needs, he has made efforts to comply (like using earphones), and there's evidence supporting her sensitivity. It's not about being in the wrong necessarily, but about mutual adjustment. The question is whether her requests are unreasonable. Since she's given him options and he's responding, it seems like a reasonable compromise. The boyfriend's actions show he's trying to respect her needs, so the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
