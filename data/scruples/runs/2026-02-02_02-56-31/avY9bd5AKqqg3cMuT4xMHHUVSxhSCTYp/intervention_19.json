  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits because the sounds and brightness affect their sleep. They mention having misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They've shown a study to the boyfriend, and he responds by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Moving in together often requires compromise. The user has a legitimate health issue (misophonia) that's impacting their well-being. They're communicating their needs, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014using earphones\u2014suggests he's trying to accommodate, but maybe not fully. The user isn't just being picky; there's a medical aspect here.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine. But since they live together, both need to make adjustments. The user isn't unreasonable for wanting a sleep-friendly environment. The key points are communication, the health issue, and mutual accommodation. The user is advocating for their needs, which isn't being an asshole. The boyfriend might need to find other ways besides earphones if the sound still affects the user through the walls, but the user isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
