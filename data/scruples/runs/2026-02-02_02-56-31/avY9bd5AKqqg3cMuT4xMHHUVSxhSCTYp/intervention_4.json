I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits, like turning down the laptop sound and brightness, especially when he listens to ASMR, which they find uncomfortable. They mention they have misophonia, specifically with whispering ASMR, and showed him a study to explain their feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has a legitimate reason for their discomfort\u2014misophonia is a real condition. They\u2019re in a new living situation together, so boundaries are important. They made efforts to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. However, the boyfriend might feel his own needs are being ignored, like his preference for ASMR to relax. The user is asking him to adjust for their comfort, but if he's also not happy about it, there's a balance issue.\n\nIs it fair to ask him to change? Yes, if it's affecting their health. Misophonia can cause significant anxiety, so it's valid. But maybe the user could find a compromise, like using headphones or moving the laptop out of the bedroom. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate, but maybe not enough. The user might need to be more flexible, but they\u2019re also in their right to prioritize their well-being. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but I need to check if the user is being too demanding without considering the boyfriend's needs. Since they communicated and provided a study, it's a reasonable approach. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" might be a red herring. The key is mutual respect and finding a solution. So the user isn't the asshole here.\n"
