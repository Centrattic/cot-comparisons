I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness so they can sleep, especially when he's watching ASMR with whispering, which causes them anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions they have misophonia when it comes to whispering, which is causing physical discomfort. They provided research and the boyfriend responded by using earphones. But the author still feels they need to ask him multiple times each night to turn it down. The question is whether their actions make them the asshole.\n\nI should think about both sides. On one hand, the author has legitimate health concerns (misophonia) that affect their well-being. They're trying to communicate their needs to maintain a good sleeping environment. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a bedtime routine he enjoys. The author is consistently asking for adjustments, which might be seen as nagging, but they have a valid reason.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014using earphones after being shown the study\u2014shows he's making an effort. However, the author still needs to remind him every night, which isn't ideal. But since the author's issue is a medical condition, it's reasonable for them to set boundaries. The boyfriend should respect that even if it's inconvenient for him. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they provided evidence and the boyfriend is trying, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem is the ongoing need to ask, but the root issue is the boyfriend not fully accommodating a health condition. So the answer is B.\n"
