I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. They mention that their boyfriend uses ASMR and YouTube in the evenings, which they find really irritating because they have misophonia, especially with whispering. They've shown him a study about this, and he reacted by putting in earphones, but the user still feels they're being a burden.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The user has a legitimate medical condition (misophonia) that causes them anxiety and discomfort when exposed to certain sounds, like whispering in ASMR. They've communicated this to their boyfriend and even provided evidence, which he reacted to by using earphones. However, the user still ends up having to ask him repeatedly during the night to adjust the settings. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy about these requests.\n\nSo, from the user's perspective, they're making a reasonable request to address their health and comfort. They're sharing their feelings and the study to explain why this is important. The boyfriend's response was immediate (using earphones), but maybe not consistent or ongoing. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for making these requests, especially since they need a quiet and dark environment to sleep.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has a bedtime routine that he's used to. Moving in together means both need to adjust. If he's not willing to consistently comply with the requests, even after understanding the reason, that might be his issue. But the user isn't asking to eliminate the habit entirely\u2014just to adjust when it's affecting them. The boyfriend's response of using earphones suggests he's willing to make a change, but maybe the user still feels the adjustments aren't enough or aren't maintained.\n\nThe key factors here are communication, mutual adjustment, and respect for each other's needs. The user has communicated their needs clearly and provided evidence. The boyfriend's reaction shows some adjustment, but maybe not enough. The user isn't being unreasonable by asking for these adjustments to protect their health. Misophonia is a recognized condition, so their sensitivity isn't just personal preference but a medical issue.\n\nHowever, if the user is constantly nagging without considering the boyfriend's needs, that could be a problem. But the scenario doesn't indicate that. The user is explaining their distress and trying to find a solution. The boyfriend's initial adjustment (earphones) might not be sufficient if the brightness is still an issue, but the user is asking for more adjustments. Since they're in a shared living space, both need to compromise. The user isn't wrong for advocating for their health; they're seeking a solution that allows both to coexist.\n\nSo, putting this together, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). The user has a valid reason related to their health and has made efforts to communicate and find a solution. The boyfriend's response is a step in the right direction, but perhaps more consistent adjustments are needed. The user isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking necessary accommodations.\n"
