I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's brightness and volume when they're trying to sleep, especially when the boyfriend listens to ASMR that the author finds uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple just moved in together. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine involving his laptop, which the author finds disruptive. The author asks him to turn down the volume and brightness, which seems reasonable because they need silence and darkness. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy about it.\n\nThen there's the ASMR part. The author has misophonia triggered by whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They showed a study to him, and he reacted by putting in earphones. The author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is advocating for their own comfort and health by asking for adjustments. Misophonia is a real condition, so their sensitivity is legitimate. The boyfriend's habits are affecting their well-being. The author is trying to find a middle ground by adjusting the laptop settings and using the study to explain their feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's making an effort to accommodate, but maybe not enough. The author is communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. Since they've just moved in together, establishing boundaries is normal.\n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate issue and trying to find solutions. The boyfriend could also be more considerate, but the author isn't the one at fault here. Their actions are about their own well-being and they've provided evidence to support their request. So the answer should be B.\n"
