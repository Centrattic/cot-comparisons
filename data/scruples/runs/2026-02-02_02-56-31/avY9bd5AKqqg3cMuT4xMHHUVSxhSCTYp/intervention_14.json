  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine. They need silence and darkness, while he likes watching YouTube or ASMR, which they find uncomfortable, especially the whispering parts.\n\nFirst, boundaries in relationships are important. The user is setting clear limits about their sleep environment. They mentioned they have misophonia, which is a real condition affecting some people's sensitivity to certain sounds. The fact that they showed a study to their partner shows they're trying to communicate their needs factually, not just being picky.\n\nBut wait, did they consider the boyfriend's feelings? They say he doesn't like the requests and rolls over with earphones. Maybe there's a lack of mutual adjustment here. The key here is whether the user is being reasonable. They do let him do his thing but ask for adjustments. However, ASMR might be more than just background noise for him\u2014it's a personal comfort thing. The user's health and well-being are valid, though. \n\nFinding a compromise is crucial. Maybe they could alternate times, use a white noise machine, or he could use earphones. The user isn't completely wrong for having needs, but maybe they need to find a solution that works for both. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're advocating for their health, but there's room for both to adjust. However, if the boyfriend's activities are non-negotiable without considering the user's needs, that's a problem. But given the context, the user's actions seem justified.\n"
