  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThey live with their boyfriend, and he uses his laptop at bedtime, which includes ASMR. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep. They've asked him to turn down the volume and brightness, which he does, but it's causing some tension. The author has misophonia specifically to whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious. They showed him a study, and he used earphones.\n\nFirst, consider the author's needs. They have a legitimate medical condition\u2014misophonia triggered by certain sounds like whispering. That's a real issue. They're communicating their needs, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend is adjusting by using earphones, so he's making an effort. But the author feels they're being too pushy. \n\nOn the other side, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine. Moving in together can lead to conflicts over habits. The author is setting boundaries to protect their well-being. Since the ASMR is causing physical discomfort (anxiety, feeling trapped), it's not just a preference. The author isn't banning all sounds, just specific ones. They're also providing information (the study) to help him understand, which is a good approach.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? They're not asking for a complete stop, just adjustments. The boyfriend is complying, so maybe it's a matter of communication style. But the author isn't wrong to prioritize their health. So the answer is probably B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
