  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening habits when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, the couple just moved in together, so they're still getting used to each other's routines. The boyfriend's bedtime involves using his laptop, which includes ASMR content. The poster has a need for silence and darkness, which is conflicting with his habits.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The poster has clearly communicated their discomfort, especially with the ASMR's whispering. They mentioned a study about misophonia, which they shared with him. The boyfriend's reaction was to roll away and use earphones, which suggests he's making an effort to accommodate their needs.\n\nNow, considering if the poster is in the wrong. They're not being aggressive, just expressing their needs. They're asking for adjustments that are reasonable, like lowering the volume or using earphones. The boyfriend should respect their boundaries, especially in a shared living space. However, the poster is also being considerate by allowing him to do his routine but within the limits that don't disturb them. \n\nThe boyfriend's guilt over his pleasure isn't the poster's responsibility. The main issue is the impact on the poster's well-being. Since they've communicated their feelings and the boyfriend is taking steps to comply, it seems like the poster is justified in their requests. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong) because they're asserting their needs respectfully and the boyfriend is making accommodations. The poster isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking a solution that benefits both parties.\n"
