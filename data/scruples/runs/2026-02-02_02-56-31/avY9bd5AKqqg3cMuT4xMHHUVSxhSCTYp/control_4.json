  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening habits when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple just moved in together, and their bedtime routines clash. The boyfriend uses a laptop with some sound and brightness, which the author finds disruptive. The author has misophonia triggered by whispering in ASMR, causing anxiety and discomfort. They've shown him a study about it, and he responds by putting in earphones.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's need for silence and darkness conflicts with the boyfriend's habits. The author has communicated their discomfort, and the boyfriend makes adjustments (like earphones) when he listens to ASMR. The author also asks for adjustments regarding the laptop's brightness and sound.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, moving in together means both need to compromise. The author is expressing their needs, which are valid due to misophonia. They're not being unreasonable by asking for adjustments that help them sleep. The boyfriend is making changes when he's aware of the issue, which shows he's trying to accommodate. However, there might be a balance. The author's constant requests could be wearing on the boyfriend, but the key is whether the author is overstepping. Since the author's health (due to misophonia) is a legitimate concern, their actions seem justified. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) suggests he respects the author's needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
