  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use at night because it's affecting their sleep. They mention ASMR with whispering, which they have a sensitivity to (misophonia). \n\nFirst, they moved in together, so they knew his habits beforehand. They've tried to accommodate by letting him watch, but the noise and light still bother them. They ask him to adjust, which seems reasonable since they need silence and darkness. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to roll away and use earphones after seeing the study. That suggests he's making an effort. But the user feels they're being too much because he doesn't like the requests.\n\nBut the user has a valid health reason\u2014misophonia is real and can cause anxiety. They're not just being picky. So their needs are legitimate. The boyfriend's pleasure (ASMR) vs. the user's need for a restful environment. \n\nIn a relationship, both need to compromise. The user is setting boundaries for their well-being, which is okay. The boyfriend should try to accommodate, maybe using earphones. The user isn't being unreasonable here. So probably answer B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
