  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits due to the laptop's sound and brightness, especially when he listens to ASMR. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that they need silence and darkness to sleep, which is their routine. The boyfriend has a different routine involving YouTube, ASMR, or laptop use. The author has tried to communicate their discomfort, showing a study about misophonia related to whispering ASMR. The boyfriend reacts by using earphones, which might indicate he respects their request.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's habits are part of his bedtime routine, which he might find necessary for relaxation. The key here is whether the author is overstepping by asking for adjustments that affect his comfort. However, the author has made compromises, like allowing him to watch his content but asking for adjustments. They also provided evidence of their sensitivity, which the boyfriend responded to.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition, and the author's reaction to certain sounds is valid. It's about personal health and well-being. The boyfriend's willingness to use earphones suggests he's making an effort. The question is whether the author is being inconsiderate. Since they moved in together, adjusting to each other's needs is part of a healthy relationship. The author's requests are reasonable and necessary for their health, so they aren't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
