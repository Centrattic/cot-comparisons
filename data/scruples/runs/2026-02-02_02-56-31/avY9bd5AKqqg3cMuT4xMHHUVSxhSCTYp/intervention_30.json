  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. They also mention that the boyfriend listens to ASMR, specifically whispering ones, which makes them anxious and uncomfortable. They've explained this to him and even showed a study about misophonia. Their boyfriend's reaction was to roll away and use earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if their actions are reasonable. The user is living with their boyfriend, so shared living spaces often require some compromise. The user's need for silence and darkness for sleep is valid, especially if they have sleep issues or misophonia. They've tried to communicate their needs and provided information about their condition. The boyfriend's response of using earphones suggests he's trying to accommodate them, but maybe not optimally.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he's used to. Moving in together might mean both need to adjust. The user is asking for adjustments, which is normal in a relationship. However, if the boyfriend is uncomfortable with these requests, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, using earphones more consistently or maybe using a white noise machine instead of ASMR. The user isn't forbidding him from doing these things entirely, just asking for adjustments when they're trying to sleep. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition, so the user isn't just being overly sensitive. They've explained their feelings and provided evidence. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away might be a defensive action, but it doesn't address the underlying issue. The user isn't being unreasonable; they're trying to coexist in a shared space. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs while also respecting their partner's habits as much as possible. The key is mutual adjustment. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
