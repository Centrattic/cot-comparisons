  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening during bedtime. They mention they have misophonia related to whispering, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They've shown research to him, and he responds by using earphones. \n\nFirst, I should consider their need for a quiet and dark environment to sleep. That's pretty standard, so it's reasonable to expect some adjustments. The boyfriend's habits are affecting their sleep, which is important for health. The user is communicating their needs, which is good. They also provided information about misophonia, which shows they're trying to explain the issue beyond just being sensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's bedtime routine is a personal preference. But since they live together, there's a mutual need to accommodate each other. The boyfriend using earphones after being shown the research suggests he's making an effort. However, the user is consistently asking for adjustments, which might be causing tension. The key here is whether the user's requests are reasonable and if they're being considerate of his habits.\n\nThe user isn't outright banning his activities but asking for adjustments that don't interfere with their sleep. Since misophonia is a legitimate condition, their discomfort is valid. They're also trying to find a middle ground (like using earphones, adjusting brightness). So the user isn't being unreasonable. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) indicates he's respecting her needs. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
