  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for constantly asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. They also mentioned that their boyfriend's ASMR listening, especially whispering, makes them anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider mutual respect in a relationship. Both partners should accommodate each other's needs. The user has a valid point about needing silence and darkness for sleep, which is pretty standard. They communicated their discomfort and even showed a study about misophonia, which explains their reaction. That's proactive and shows they're trying to be understanding.\n\nOn the other side, the boyfriend's bedtime routine involves activities that are affecting the user. However, moving in together means both have to compromise. The user isn't outright banning his habits but is asking for adjustments that shouldn't be too invasive. He did comply by putting in earphones after being shown the study, so he's making an effort too. \n\nThe key here is whether the user's requests are reasonable. Since they've explained their health-related discomfort and the boyfriend is making adjustments, the user is acting in good faith. The boyfriend might be frustrated, but the user's needs are legitimate. It's a balance of both trying to meet in the middle. The user isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking a solution that works for both, which is necessary in a shared living situation. So, the answer seems to be that the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
