  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is about a couple who just moved in together. The author's boyfriend uses his laptop late at night, watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds bothersome. The author has to ask him to turn down the volume and brightness, and when he listens to whispering ASMR, she gets really uncomfortable. She told him she has misophonia related to whispering and showed him a study. He then put on earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is asking for adjustments to her sleeping environment, which she needs for rest. That's important for health. The boyfriend's habits are interfering with her needs. She's communicating her needs, which is reasonable. She even provided research to explain her reaction, which shows she's trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's response was to use earphones, which solves the problem on his end without compromising hers. \n\nBut wait, is there a balance? The boyfriend's habits are his personal time. But when moving in together, compromises are necessary. The author isn't forbidding him from doing these things entirely when she's asleep; she's just adjusting the environment during her sleep time. The key here is mutual respect. The author is asserting her needs, which are valid, especially with a medical/psychological condition like misophonia. The boyfriend adapting by using earphones is a reasonable compromise. \n\nAre there any red flags? The author is asking repeatedly, maybe causing tension. But she's clear about her needs. The boyfriend isn't resistant beyond the initial adjustment. The fact that he complied after she explained the study shows he's making an effort. So I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
