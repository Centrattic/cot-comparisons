I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits\u2014specifically, turning down the laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. They also mention that his ASMR, especially whispering, makes them anxious and trapped. They've explained their feelings, shown a study about misophonia, and he reacted by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, consider the context: they've moved in together, so shared living spaces come with compromises. The user's needs are about their health and well-being, mentioning anxiety and misophonia, which are legitimate issues. They\u2019re trying to communicate their needs, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) suggests he tried to comply, but maybe there's more to his side. However, the user isn't demanding to stop all activities, just adjusting them to minimize disturbance. It's a reasonable request, especially since the user provided a study to explain their condition. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine, which is to watch YouTube or listen to ASMR. He might also need some personal space and time. But when someone's health is affected, it's a priority. The user is asking for adjustments that are manageable, not impossible. There's no indication they're being overly controlling, just seeking a compromise that respects both their needs. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being while trying to accommodate their partner's habits. The key here is mutual respect and finding a balance. The answer should be B.\n"
