  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. So, first, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe user's main issues are that their boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness on when they need silence and darkness to sleep. They also mention that the boyfriend listens to whispering ASMR, which causes them misophonia symptoms. They've shown him a study, and he responded by using earphones. But the user is worried about being an asshole for repeatedly asking for adjustments.\n\nNow, considering the context: they just moved in together, which means establishing shared living habits. The user made it clear beforehand that they need a quiet, dark environment. The boyfriend's habits are affecting her sleep quality. Misophonia is a real condition, so her feelings are valid here. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being respected. He has a bedtime routine that he enjoys, and if he's avoiding it because of the user's requests, that's a problem too. The key here is mutual respect and finding a compromise. The user isn't forbidding him entirely; they're asking for adjustments like lower volume or earphones. The boyfriend's reaction (using earphones) suggests he's making an effort.\n\nBut the user is asking if they're in the wrong. In most cases, when someone's health or well-being is affected by another's habits, it's reasonable to request reasonable changes. Since they communicated their needs clearly and he's started adjusting, it seems the user is doing the right thing. However, if the boyfriend feels his needs are entirely neglected, that's a different side. But the question is about the user's actions. \n\nSo, considering all factors: valid communication, health reasons, mutual adjustments. The answer is probably B (No, not in the wrong). They're advocating for their needs, which is necessary for a harmonious living situation. The boyfriend should also be respectful of her needs. It's a balance, but the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
