  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the person finds disruptive because they need silence and darkness. The key points here are about their living arrangements (they just moved in together), the person's specific needs for sleep, and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the person is setting boundaries for their own comfort, which is reasonable. They mention that they have misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety. They provided a study to the boyfriend, which he then acted on by using earphones. That seems like a valid effort to communicate their needs.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and using earphones\u2014suggests he respects their boundaries once informed. However, the person feels they have to ask repeatedly, which might indicate that the boyfriend isn't consistently following through. But the person isn't being aggressive; they're expressing discomfort and seeking solutions.\n\nThe question is whether this is the person's fault. Since they're advocating for their health and well-being (due to a medical condition, misophonia), and they're trying to communicate openly, it's not their fault. It's about mutual adjustment in a new living situation. The boyfriend should be accommodating, especially since he's aware of the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
