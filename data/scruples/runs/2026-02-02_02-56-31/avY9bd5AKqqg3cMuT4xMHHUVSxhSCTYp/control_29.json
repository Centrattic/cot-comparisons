  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author's boyfriend is watching or listening to ASMR on his laptop before bed. The author wants a quiet and dark room, so they ask him to lower the volume and brightness. The boyfriend doesn't like being asked, but he complies when he's doing whispering ASMR, which the author finds really uncomfortable due to misophonia. The author showed him a study about this, and he put in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is dealing with a roommate situation where they need different bedtime environments. The boyfriend has his routine, but the author's health or comfort is affected. The author communicates their needs and the boyfriend responds by using earphones. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause strong negative reactions. The author isn't just being picky; there's a medical aspect here. The boyfriend, after being informed, makes an adjustment to accommodate the author. That shows he's trying to be considerate.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for setting these boundaries. But they\u2019re not being unreasonable. They\u2019re explaining their needs and the boyfriend is respecting them. There's no indication the author is overstepping; they\u2019re just asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) suggests he's willing to compromise. \n\nSo, considering that the author has a valid reason (misophonia) and the boyfriend is making changes, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
