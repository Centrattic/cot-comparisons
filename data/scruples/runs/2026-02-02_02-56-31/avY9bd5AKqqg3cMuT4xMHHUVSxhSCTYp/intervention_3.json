I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening when she's trying to sleep. She has misophonia, specifically with whispering ASMR, which causes her anxiety and discomfort. They just moved in together, and she's aware of his bedtime habits but it's conflicting with hers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. She's asking him to lower the volume and brightness because she needs silence and darkness. That seems reasonable since they're sharing a living space. It's common for people to have different sleep needs, and communication is key here. She tried explaining her misophonia and showed him research, which shows she's making an effort to communicate her feelings and provide evidence. When he listens, like putting earphones in, that's a positive response.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being asked to change his own routine. He might feel his preferences are being ignored. But since they're in a relationship, mutual adjustments are expected. The fact that he rolls over or uses earphones when she asks suggests he's willing to comply, even if it's not his preference. \n\nThe user is not being unreasonable here. She's clearly communicating her needs and making accommodations where possible. Her issue with ASMR is specific, and she's educating him about it. Requiring him to use headphones in bed is a standard request in many relationships. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). They need to continue working together to find solutions, but she's justified in her requests.\n"
