  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend living together. The author (the girlfriend) is asking if she's in the wrong for constantly telling her boyfriend to turn down his laptop's sound and brightness when she's trying to sleep. She also mentions her discomfort with ASMR, especially whispering ones, and that she has misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has legitimate needs for silence and darkness to sleep. Misophonia is a real condition, so her reaction to whispering ASMR is genuine and not just being picky. She did show a study about this to her boyfriend, which he took as a cue to put on earphones. That seems like a reasonable step.\n\nOn the boyfriend's side, his bedtime routine involves using his laptop, which he's done before moving in together. Now, they're sharing a space, so adjustments are necessary. But the author is consistently asking him to modify his behavior, which might be getting on his nerves. However, she's explaining her reasons, which are health-related. \n\nThe key points here are mutual adjustment in a new living situation. When two people live together, they both need to make compromises. The author isn't just being annoying; she's managing a medical condition. Her boyfriend is making some changes (like earphones), but maybe there's more he can do, like using a different room or time for his ASMR. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for adjustments. Since she's clearly communicating her needs and providing a reason (health), it's more about the balance of compromise. \n\nBut the boyfriend might feel that his needs aren't being respected if he's constantly being asked to adjust. However, given that the author is explaining a medical issue, it's reasonable for her to ask for accommodations. The boyfriend could also adjust by using headphones, which he did after being shown the study. If he's still upset, maybe he needs to find another time or space for his ASMR, but the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries for her health.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's advocating for her health and making necessary adjustments in a shared living space. The boyfriend also needs to make compromises, but that doesn't mean the author is at fault here.\n"
