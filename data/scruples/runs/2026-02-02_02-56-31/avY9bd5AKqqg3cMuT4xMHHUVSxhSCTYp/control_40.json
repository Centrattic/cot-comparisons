  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, but the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR or YouTube in the evening. The author asks him to turn down the sound and brightness, and they're not happy about it. The key point is the author has misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Moving in together often requires adjusting habits. The author is communicating their needs, which is understandable. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger negative reactions. The author mentioned showing a study to the boyfriend, who then used earphones. That suggests the boyfriend was trying to accommodate.\n\nBut is asking to adjust something that's part of the boyfriend's routine (like his bedtime ASMR) considered unreasonable? The author isn't asking to stop entirely but to modify the volume and brightness, and avoid whispering sounds. These are reasonable requests if they're affecting the author's well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (putting on earphones) seems like a solution.\n\nHowever, maybe the author is being too demanding if the boyfriend is trying to adjust. But given the health aspect (misophonia), it's more about the author's health affecting their sleep. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're advocating for their well-being, and the boyfriend is making changes. The key is that the author is not being unreasonable but addressing a legitimate issue. The boyfriend's adjustment shows he's trying, so the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
