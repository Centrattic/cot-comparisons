  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine to accommodate their sensitivity to ASMR, specifically whispering. They mention they have misophonia when it comes to those sounds and provided a study. The boyfriend reacts by putting in earphones and rolling away.\n\nFirst, consider boundaries in a relationship. When two people live together, especially in a new shared space, it's normal to have differing needs. The user's need for silence and darkness for sleep is valid. They're not being unreasonable by asking for adjustments. The boyfriend's habits are his preference, but they're affecting the user's well-being. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition that causes strong emotional or physiological responses to specific sounds. The user explained their situation, even sharing a study, which shows they're trying to communicate their needs clearly. The boyfriend's reaction (using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply, which is a good sign. \n\nHowever, the user is repeatedly asking for adjustments each night. Maybe they could explore solutions together, like setting a specific time when the boyfriend uses his own earphones, or using a white noise machine to mask the sounds. The key issue is whether the user's requests are reasonable and if they're being communicated respectfully. \n\nThe user isn't demanding; they're asking for changes to ensure their comfort. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure isn't the user's problem to fix. The user has the right to their sleep environment. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away) might indicate he's not fully understanding the issue, but the user isn't at fault for needing to express their needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and well-being, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's adjustment shows he's trying, but maybe more discussion is needed. The answer is B.\n"
