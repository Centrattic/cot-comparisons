  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage at night because it's affecting their sleep. They mention needing silence and darkness, while he uses ASMR or YouTube which he finds relaxing. The conflict is about differing needs in their shared living space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has a valid need for a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is important for their health. Misophonia, especially to whispering, is a real condition that can cause significant distress. They did share a study about it, which shows they're trying to explain their sensitivity.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he relies on. Moving in together often requires compromise. The user is asking him to adjust his habits, which he might find frustrating if it's a big part of his relaxation. But the user isn't outright banning it; they're asking for adjustments like lowering volume or using headphones, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The user is expressing their needs and providing context (the study) to help him understand. They\u2019re not being unreasonable by asking for accommodations that respect their health. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply once he understands the issue.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Probably not. They\u2019re advocating for their well-being while trying to be considerate. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure (ASMR) might be his own issue, but the user isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The answer should be B (No).\n"
