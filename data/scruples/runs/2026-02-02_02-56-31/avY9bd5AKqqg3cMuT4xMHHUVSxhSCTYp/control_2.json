I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness at night, which is bothering the author. The author has misophonia triggered by whispering ASMR, which makes her anxious and irritated. She's been asking him to adjust his routine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple just moved in together, so it's a new living arrangement. The author has a medical condition (misophonia) that's causing real discomfort. She's communicated her feelings, even showed him a study. He responds by using earphones, which is a reasonable compromise. \n\nThe question is whether her asking for these adjustments is justified. Since she's explaining a legitimate issue and he's making changes, it seems reasonable. Misophonia is recognized as a real condition, so her sensitivity is valid. The boyfriend's actions are part of his bedtime routine, but respecting her needs is important in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend is also entitled to his routine. However, since she's communicating her needs and he's adjusting, it's a mutual effort. The author isn't being unreasonable but is advocating for her health. The answer should be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
