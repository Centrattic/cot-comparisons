  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage when they're trying to sleep. The key points here are the living situation\u2014just moved in together\u2014and the conflicting bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author finds annoying due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, the author is communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. They\u2019re not just complaining but explaining the health aspect (misophonia) and showing a study. That's a valid reason because it's affecting their well-being. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling over and putting in earphones suggests he's making an effort, which is good.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's bedtime routine is also his personal habit. The author is asking for adjustments, which is reasonable if it's affecting their health. The question is whether it's \"too much.\" Since they live together, some compromise is necessary. The author isn't banning him from using the laptop entirely but wants it adjusted. The boyfriend might feel his habits are being restricted, but the author's discomfort is legitimate. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author isn't being unreasonable. They're advocating for their health needs. The boyfriend could also consider alternatives like using headphones or moving to another room. The fact that the author provided evidence about misophonia adds weight to their request. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
