  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening in the bedroom. They moved in together, and their sleep routines clash. The boyfriend uses his laptop with some brightness and sound, which the user finds disturbing. The user has misophonia, particularly with whispering ASMR, causing anxiety and discomfort. They showed a study to the boyfriend, who then put in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user is clearly stating their needs for silence and darkness to sleep. They've communicated their discomfort, adjusted their environment, and provided information to help the boyfriend understand the issue. That seems reasonable. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a bedtime routine that's different, but since they're sharing a bedroom, adjustments might be necessary. \n\nThe user isn't just being petty about noise; they have a specific condition (misophonia) that makes certain sounds unpleasant. They're making reasonable requests, like reducing brightness and volume. The boyfriend's reaction of putting in earphones after being shown a study seems like a positive step. But the user is concerned they might be overstepping by repeatedly asking. However, since this affects their health and well-being (due to anxiety and sleep issues), it's important to address.\n\nMoving in together often requires compromise. The user is trying to adapt by communicating their needs, which is a healthy approach. The boyfriend might need to find alternatives, like using a separate room or headphones, which he started doing. The key here is whether the user's requests are unreasonable. Since they're making efforts to accommodate each other and the boyfriend is also adjusting, it seems like a balanced situation. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
