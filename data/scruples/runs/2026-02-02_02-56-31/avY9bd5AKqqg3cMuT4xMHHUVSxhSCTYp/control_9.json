  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening when they're trying to sleep. The situation involves moving in together, so there's a new living arrangement which can bring up conflicts.\n\nFirst, the author mentions needing silence and darkness for their bedtime routine, which is understandable. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a routine that includes watching YouTube, using ASMR, etc. The author is asking him to lower the volume, brightness, etc., which he does, but it seems he's not happy about it. The author also explains that they have misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They showed a study to him, and he responded by putting in earphones.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are mutual respect and communication. The author is communicating their needs, which is important. The boyfriend is adjusting by using earphones, which is a reasonable compromise. However, the author keeps asking for adjustments, which might be wearing on the boyfriend. But the author's health and well-being are also a factor here, especially with misophonia. \n\nIs the author overstepping? They are asking for things that affect their health, so it's not just about being picky. The boyfriend's response of putting in earphones is a step towards solving the problem, but maybe the author needs to consider alternatives, like using earplugs themselves or having the boyfriend use earphones earlier. But the author is not being unreasonable; they have a legitimate medical condition. The boyfriend might need to make more adjustments, but the author isn't in the wrong for advocating for their needs. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). However, there's a balance\u2014maybe the author could find other solutions too. But given the information, the author's actions are justified.\n"
