  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and his partner moving in together, with differing bedtime routines. The key points are the boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness, which the author finds disruptive. The author has misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, leading to anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate dynamic. The author is trying to maintain a peaceful sleep environment, which is a basic need. The boyfriend's habits are affecting her well-being. Misophonia is a real condition, and she's communicated her feelings, even providing research. That shows she's not just being picky but has a genuine sensitivity.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's bedtime routine is his way of relaxing. The question is whether the author is overstepping by asking him to adjust. But since they live together, mutual adjustments are expected. The author isn't forbidding him entirely but is asking for accommodations like lowering volume or brightness. The boyfriend's response of using earphones when he knows it's a problem suggests he respects her needs.\n\nThe author's actions are about her health and comfort. She's given him options and tried to explain her condition. The boyfriend might be frustrated, but the author isn't the one at fault here. The key is that she's made reasonable requests and he's making efforts to comply. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
