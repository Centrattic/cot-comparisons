I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop settings and avoid certain types of ASMR because it affects their sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they need silence and darkness for bedtime, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which they find uncomfortable due to misophonia. The author has communicated their feelings and shown research about misophonia. The boyfriend's reaction is to put on earphones, which suggests he's trying to accommodate.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause distress. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for adjustments. They've made an effort to explain their needs and provided evidence. The boyfriend's guilt pleasure is ASMR, but he's making accommodations. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, they're setting boundaries for their health and well-being. If the boyfriend is complying, then the author isn't being unreasonable. However, if the boyfriend is consistently unhappy or the author is nagging without compromise, that could be an issue. But from the description, the author is asking for basic adjustments, and the boyfriend is responding by using earphones. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for asking for these adjustments. Since they've communicated their needs, provided context, and the boyfriend is making efforts, it seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
