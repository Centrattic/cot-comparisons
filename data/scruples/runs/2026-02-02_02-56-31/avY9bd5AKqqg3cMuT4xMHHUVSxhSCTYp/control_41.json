  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their boyfriend's bedtime habits and how they're affecting the writer's sleep and comfort.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses his laptop in bed\u2014watching YouTube, ASMR, etc. The writer needs silence and darkness to sleep. They've been asking him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc., because the sounds and light bother them. The user mentions that they have misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious and unsettled. They showed a study to their boyfriend, who then put in earphones.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship. When two people live together, especially in a romantic relationship, they often have to make compromises. The writer is trying to communicate their needs to get a good night's sleep, which is important for their well-being. The boyfriend isn't ignoring their requests; he's taking steps like using earphones after being shown the study. \n\nThe user isn't just being a nag; they're dealing with a legitimate sensitivity (misophonia), which can be a recognized condition. They're also making reasonable requests\u2014lowering the volume, adjusting brightness\u2014which are common in shared living spaces. The boyfriend's actions, while he has his own preferences, might need to adapt for the sake of the relationship. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the boyfriend feels his needs aren't being considered. But the user hasn't mentioned that they're not making an effort. They\u2019re trying to find a middle ground, like the boyfriend using earphones. The fact that he immediately complied after being shown the study suggests he's making an effort too. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the user is asserting their needs in a respectful way, providing information, and the boyfriend is responding. There's no indication the user is being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
