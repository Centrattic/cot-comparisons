I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple moving in together, with the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness at night. The key points here are the author's sensitivity to ASMR, specifically whispering, which causes them anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason because their sleep environment requires silence and darkness. Misophonia is a real condition, and even though it's not as widely recognized as some other conditions, it's still a legitimate issue. The boyfriend's habits are causing the author distress, which is a problem. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being respected. He uses ASMR as a guilty pleasure, which he might rely on for relaxation. \n\nBut when you move in together, both partners need to accommodate each other's needs. The author is making reasonable requests\u2014like lowering the volume and brightness, using earphones. Those are common compromises in a shared living space. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and putting in earphones) after being shown the study suggests he's aware of the issue and made a change. \n\nIs the author being inconsiderate? They are communicating their needs, which is important. The boyfriend should be willing to adjust, especially since the author's health and comfort are affected. However, the author might need to find a middle ground, like designating specific times or areas where the boyfriend can use his laptop without disturbing the author. But in the given scenario, the author hasn't crossed the line; they're asserting their needs and seeking solutions. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
