I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend and his bedtime habits conflicting with the author's needs. The boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness, and he listens to ASMR, especially whispering ones, which the author finds really irritating due to misophonia. The author asks him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc., and shows him a study about misophonia. The boyfriend responds by putting earphones in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for silence and darkness to sleep. Misophonia is a real condition, and whispering can trigger strong negative reactions. The boyfriend is doing something he enjoys, which is his right, but it's affecting the author's well-being. \n\nThe author is communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. They provided evidence (the study) to explain their discomfort, which shows they're trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe not in the best way. \n\nHowever, the author might be overstepping if they're being too demanding or not considering the boyfriend's needs. But given the health aspect (misophonia), it's more about a medical issue. The key points are communication and mutual adjustment. The author is setting boundaries, which is healthy, especially when it's about their health. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure might be a red flag, but that's more about his attitude than the author's actions.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and making reasonable requests. The boyfriend needs to accommodate, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
