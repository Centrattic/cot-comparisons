I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. They need silence and darkness for sleep, while he uses a laptop with ASMR, which they find irritating. They mention misophonia, a real condition where certain sounds cause discomfort. They even showed a study to him, and he responded by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, their needs are valid. Everyone has different sleep requirements, and needing a quiet, dark environment is common. The boyfriend's habits are causing them distress, so asking for adjustments isn't unreasonable. They're communicating their needs, which is healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) suggests he's willing to accommodate, which is good. \n\nHowever, the user might be overstepping if they're doing it every night and making him feel guilty. But given the health aspect (misophonia), it's a legitimate concern. The key is mutual respect and finding a balance. They're not being inconsiderate; they're addressing their needs. The boyfriend's guilt pleasure (ASMR) is his preference, but so is her need for sleep. Since he's making changes, it seems like a fair compromise. \n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. They need to continue communicating, but her actions are justified given her health and the situation.\n"
