I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who uses his laptop with sound and brightness on at night, which disturbs the author's sleep. The author has misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious and uncomfortable. They've communicated this to their boyfriend and asked him to adjust his habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid health issue (misophonia) that makes certain sounds uncomfortable. They\u2019ve made their partner aware and are asking for accommodations. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he enjoys. Since they live together, there's a mutual responsibility to adjust for each other's comfort.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author isn't just being a nuisance; they have a specific reason related to their well-being. They\u2019ve tried to explain their needs and even provided research. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's making an effort, but maybe not fully understanding the issue.\n\nIs the author overstepping? Probably not. They\u2019re asserting their needs in a health context. The boyfriend should also consider his partner's well-being. However, there's a balance. The author should be open to finding solutions that work for both, like using a white noise machine or setting specific times for his routine. But given the information, the author isn't in the wrong for asking for adjustments that affect their health. So the answer is B.\n"
