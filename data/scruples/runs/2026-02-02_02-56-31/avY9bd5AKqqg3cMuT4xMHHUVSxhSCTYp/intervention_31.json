  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage during bedtime because it's affecting their sleep and causing anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They moved in together, so there's a shared living space. The user needs silence and darkness for sleep, which is a common requirement. Their boyfriend uses a laptop with sound and brightness, which is his routine. The user has communicated their discomfort, and even provided a study about their issue (misophonia related to whispering). The boyfriend's reaction was to roll away and use earphones, which might indicate he's trying to comply.\n\nNow, the key points here: Is the user being reasonable? They're asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being. Misophonia is a real condition, and if the study shows a connection, that adds validity. The boyfriend's willingness to adjust (using earphones) suggests he's not being resistant. The user isn't demanding a complete change but specific adjustments. So, they're advocating for their needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's guilt pleasure is being managed in a way that respects the user's needs. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
