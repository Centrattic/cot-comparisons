  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits to accommodate their need for silence and darkness. They live together, so this is a shared living situation.\n\nFirst, the user mentions they have misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR. They showed their boyfriend a study about it, and he responded by putting in earphones. That suggests he's made an effort to comply. However, the boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop, which the user wants to turn down. The user is asking him to adjust the brightness and sound, which are reasonable requests for someone needing darkness and quiet. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The user has a legitimate health concern (misophonia) that affects their well-being. They're communicating their needs, which is a healthy part of a relationship. The boyfriend, on his part, has a different routine. The user isn't asking him to stop entirely but to adjust the volume and brightness. The fact that he puts earphones in when he hears about the study shows he's trying to accommodate. But the user feels they have to ask repeatedly, which might indicate that the boyfriend isn't fully addressing the issue, maybe because he's reluctant or not fully aware of the impact.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The user is advocating for their health and comfort, which is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) might indicate he's trying to comply, but maybe not in the most effective way. However, the user is not asking for anything unreasonable. They're asking for adjustments that are feasible (like lowering volume and brightness) and respecting the other person's needs. \n\nIn relationships, especially when moving in together, it's normal to have to adjust habits. The user isn't being overbearing; they're setting boundaries for their own well-being. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, which he might be attached to, but the user's need for a good night's sleep is also important. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re making their needs known and seeking a solution that works for both. The issue might be more about finding a compromise that satisfies both parties, like using earphones at all times or designating a specific area for his activities. But the user isn't the asshole here for standing up for their needs.\n"
