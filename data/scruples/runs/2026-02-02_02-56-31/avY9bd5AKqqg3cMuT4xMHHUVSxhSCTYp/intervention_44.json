  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they live with their boyfriend and have different bedtime routines. The user needs silence and darkness, but the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which has whispering that the user finds really annoying, even to the point of anxiety. They've asked him to turn it down, adjust brightness, etc., and he doesn't seem happy with that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user is expressing their needs for a good night's sleep, which is important for their health. They mentioned they have misophonia when it comes to whispering, which is a real condition. They even shared a study about it, which the boyfriend reacted to by putting in earphones. That reaction might indicate he's aware and trying to comply, but maybe not fully.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own routine and might feel his needs aren't respected. The user is asking him to adjust every night, which could be frustrating for him. But since they moved in together, both should have discussed these things beforehand. The user tried to communicate their needs, which is the right approach. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) might be his way of coping, but maybe he's not fully cooperative or understanding.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The user has a valid health-related issue (misophonia) affecting their well-being. 2) They've communicated their needs and tried to find solutions. 3) The boyfriend isn't entirely compliant, despite being shown evidence of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and accommodation are important. If one person's needs are affecting the other's health, it's reasonable to ask for adjustments. Since the user is trying to be accommodating but also has legitimate issues, they're probably not in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to be more understanding or find alternative ways to enjoy his ASMR without disrupting the user. The user's actions are about their well-being, so they're justified in setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
