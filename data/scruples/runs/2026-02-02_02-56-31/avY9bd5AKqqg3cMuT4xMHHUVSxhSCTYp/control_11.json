I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend's bedtime habits conflicting with the author's need for silence and darkness.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they need silence and darkness to sleep. Their boyfriend uses a laptop for YouTube or ASMR, which is his guiltiest pleasure. The author asks him to adjust the volume and brightness, which he doesn't like. The big issue is the ASMR with whispering causing the author misophonia symptoms. They showed a study to the boyfriend, who then put in earphones.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual needs conflicting. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend has his own habits that he enjoys, but they interfere with the author's well-being. The author isn't making a demand that's unreasonable; they're asking for adjustments that should be manageable, like using headphones for the ASMR. The boyfriend's reaction was to roll away and put in earphones, which suggests he complied after being shown the study. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is willing to adjust (using earphones), then the author is justified in setting those boundaries. The author is explaining their discomfort and trying to find a solution, which is mature. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure isn't something he's being forced to give up entirely but just to modify his behavior in shared sleeping space. \n\nSo, no, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. The boyfriend should respect that and make the necessary adjustments without resentment. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
