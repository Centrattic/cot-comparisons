I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who watches YouTube or listens to ASMR on his laptop before bed, which the author finds disruptive because they need silence and darkness. The author asks him to lower the volume, dim the screen, etc., and specifically mentions that whispering ASMR makes her anxious. She showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he responded by using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a legitimate need for a sleep-conducive environment. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. If the boyfriend's ASMR, especially whispering, causes her anxiety and discomfort, she's not in the wrong for expressing that. She's trying to communicate her needs and adjust their shared living situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own preferences. Moving in together often requires compromise. But the author isn't banning his activities entirely; she's asking for adjustments that don't affect him much, like using headphones. He did comply after being shown the study. \n\nThe key points are: the author's health and well-being are affected, she's communicated her needs, and the boyfriend made a reasonable accommodation. She's not being unreasonable by setting boundaries for her own comfort. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
