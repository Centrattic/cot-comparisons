I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits because his laptop's sound and brightness are bothering them. They also mention that ASMR, especially whispering, causes them anxiety and discomfort due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, the situation involves shared living spaces and differing needs. The user has a clear need for silence and darkness, which is important for their sleep. The boyfriend's routine involves using his laptop, which he finds relaxing. The user isn't just making a one-off request; they're consistently asking for adjustments. They also explained their misophonia with research, which shows they're trying to communicate their feelings effectively.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling over and using earphones\u2014suggests he's making an effort to accommodate. However, the user is frustrated because these adjustments aren't sufficient. The question is whether the user is being unreasonable. \n\nConsidering that the user has a legitimate medical condition (misophonia) and they're communicating their needs clearly, it's about mutual respect and finding a middle ground. The user isn't forbidding all activities but is asking for specific adjustments. The boyfriend's preference shouldn't override the user's health and well-being. \n\nHowever, moving in together requires compromise from both sides. If the user hasn't considered solutions like separate sleeping areas or earphones for him, maybe there's room for more discussion. But given the information, the user is advocating for their needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's guilt pleasure shouldn't force the user to endure discomfort. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the user isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs, especially with a valid reason, and the boyfriend should find ways to accommodate without resentment.\n"
