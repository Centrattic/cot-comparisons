I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening when they're trying to sleep. They mention they have misophonia specifically towards whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. Their boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop with sounds and brightness, which they find disruptive. They've tried communicating this, and the boyfriend responded by using earphones and rolling over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is in a shared living situation, so respecting each other's needs is important. They made their preferences clear and provided evidence (research) about misophonia, which helped the boyfriend adjust. The boyfriend did take steps to mitigate the issue by using earphones and lowering brightness. However, the user still feels they're nagging and the boyfriend might be annoyed. \n\nIs the user being unreasonable? Well, they have a valid health concern (misophonia) that's causing them distress. They're not asking for anything extreme\u2014just adjusting volume and brightness. The boyfriend's actions to comply show he's making an effort. On the other hand, the user is constantly asking for adjustments every night, which could be wearing on the boyfriend. But considering the health impact, the user's requests seem justified. The key here is mutual respect and compromise. The user isn't being inconsiderate; they're advocating for their own well-being. The boyfriend's response is positive, but maybe there's room for the user to find alternative solutions, like using white noise or earplugs themselves. However, the main issue is the persistent disruption from the laptop. Since the boyfriend is making changes, the user isn't in the wrong for asserting their needs, especially with a documented condition. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
