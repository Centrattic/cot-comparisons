  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening habits during bedtime. \n\nFirst, the situation involves two people living together with different bedtime needs. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which affects the author's sleep. The author explains that they have misophonia, especially to whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They've tried to communicate this, even showing a study to the boyfriend.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author is clearly communicating their needs and explaining their condition. The boyfriend's reaction was to put in earphones after being shown the study, which suggests he's making an effort. The author's requests are about adjusting volume and brightness, which are reasonable in a shared living space. Misophonia is a recognized condition, so the author's sensitivity isn't just pickiness.\n\nThe main question is about whether these requests are unreasonable. Since both are trying to accommodate each other, and the author is being upfront about their needs, it's more about mutual adjustment. The boyfriend's use of earphones shows he's respecting the author's needs. The author isn't forbidding the boyfriend from using his laptop entirely but is asking for adjustments that allow both to sleep. \n\nNo one is being inconsiderate here. The author is asserting their health needs, and the boyfriend is responding positively. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
