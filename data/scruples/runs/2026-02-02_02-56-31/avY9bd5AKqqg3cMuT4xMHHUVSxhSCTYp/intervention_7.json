  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage so they can sleep. They mention that they have misophonia, especially to whispering ASMR, and that they've shown him a study about it. The boyfriend responds by putting in earphones, which makes the user feel like they're the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They have a valid medical condition (misophonia) that's affecting their well-being. They\u2019re asking for reasonable accommodations to get a good night's sleep, which is important for their health. The boyfriend's bedtime routine isn't something he can just stop doing entirely, but adjusting volume and brightness is a common courtesy in a shared living space.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his needs are also being ignored. He has a habit of using ASMR as a wind-down method, which he finds helpful. If the user is constantly asking him to change his behavior, he might feel resentful. However, the user is communicating their needs and providing medical evidence, which should be taken into account.\n\nThe key here is communication and mutual respect. The user isn't just being a complainer; they're addressing specific issues that affect their health. The boyfriend's immediate reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe not in a way that's fully respectful. The user's requests are about creating a shared living environment where both can be comfortable. Since they've moved in together, it's expected that both make some adjustments. The user isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking a solution that respects their health needs. Therefore, the answer should be B, No, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
