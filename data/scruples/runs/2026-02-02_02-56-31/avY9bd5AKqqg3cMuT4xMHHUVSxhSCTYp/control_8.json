I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable due to misophonia, especially with whispering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. They've just moved in together, so establishing boundaries is important. The author is asking for a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is reasonable. Misophonia is a real condition, and the author's reaction to whispering ASMR is a legitimate sensitivity. The boyfriend seems to be responsive when asked, like putting in earphones after being shown the study. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is clearly expressing their needs, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's actions (using earphones) show he's trying to accommodate. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they're sharing a living space, compromising on such issues is expected. The author isn't forbidding the boyfriend from his activities entirely, just adjusting them in the shared sleeping area. \n\nI think the author is justified in setting these boundaries. They're not being unreasonable; it's about creating a comfortable environment for both. The boyfriend's ability to use earphones suggests a solution that works for both. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
