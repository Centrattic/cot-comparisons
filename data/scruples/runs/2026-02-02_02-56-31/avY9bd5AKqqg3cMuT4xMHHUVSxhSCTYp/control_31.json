I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop late at night with sound and brightness, which disrupts the author's sleep. The author has misophonia, especially towards whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They've communicated their needs, shown a study, and the boyfriend has responded by using earphones and moving away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate health issue (misophonia) that affects their well-being. They moved in together, so setting boundaries is important. They've taken steps to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend is making adjustments, which suggests he's trying to accommodate.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime habits, which might be important for his relaxation. But the author's health and sleep are also crucial. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they've given specific examples of their condition and the boyfriend is responding by using earphones, it seems the author is justified in their requests. The boyfriend's adjustment shows he's making an effort, so the author isn't being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (Not the Asshole).\n"
