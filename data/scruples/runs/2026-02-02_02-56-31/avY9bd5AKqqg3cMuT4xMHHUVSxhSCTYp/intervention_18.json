  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop settings when they're trying to sleep. They have different bedtime routines: he likes to watch YouTube or listen to ASMR, while she needs silence and darkness. She's not just asking occasionally but every night, which he finds annoying. The main issue is her misophonia triggered by whispering in ASMR, which makes her anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, considering their living situation, they just moved in together, so establishing boundaries is normal. She's communicating her needs, which is important in a relationship. She provided a study to explain her sensitivity, which shows she's trying to be understanding and scientific. He responded by using earphones, which is a compromise. \n\nHowever, he might feel that his habits are being restricted. But since they live together, mutual adjustments are necessary. Her needs are valid, especially with a medical condition like misophonia. The fact that he uses earphones after she explains shows he's respecting her boundaries. She's not being unreasonable; she's advocating for her well-being. \n\nOn the flip side, if she were to never consider his needs, that could be a problem. But in this case, he's making a compromise. The key is whether she's being fair. Since she's providing a solution (earphones) and he's complying, it seems balanced. The answer should be B, not the asshole.\n"
