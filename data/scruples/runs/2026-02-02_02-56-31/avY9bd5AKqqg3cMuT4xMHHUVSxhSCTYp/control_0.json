  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who watches YouTube or listens to ASMR on his laptop before bed, which disturbs the author's sleep. The author has misophonia, especially triggered by whispering ASMR, leading to anxiety and discomfort. She communicates her issues and asks him to adjust the volume and brightness, but he's not happy about it. The question is whether she's the asshole for setting these boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the author is doing. She's asking him to turn down the sound and brightness to create a more conducive sleep environment for herself. That seems reasonable because moving in together usually involves adjusting to each other's needs. She also explains her medical condition, misophonia, which has a legitimate basis. The study she showed him supports her feelings, so she's not just being picky but has a real health issue here.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his own needs are being disregarded. He uses his laptop as part of his bedtime routine, which is important for him. However, the author is clearly affected by it. The key here is communication and compromise. She's trying to communicate her needs, which is fair. But is there a middle ground? Maybe they could figure out a time when he can use the laptop without disturbing her, like using headphones after a certain hour or using a different room if possible. But since they just moved in together, it's still in the adjustment phase.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by asking for adjustments that don't infringe on his use entirely. She's not banning him from using his laptop but asking for modifications that respect her health. Misophonia is a recognized condition, so her sensitivity isn't just a personal preference. Therefore, her actions are justified. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he acknowledges her request, which implies he's not entirely against it but perhaps uncomfortable. However, the author's need for a peaceful sleep is valid, and she's not wrong for advocating for her health. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
