  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend's bedtime habits conflicting with the author's needs. The author wants him to lower his laptop's sound and brightness because they need silence and darkness to sleep. They also mention that ASMR, especially whispering, makes them anxious and uncomfortable. They showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he responded by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's needs for a quiet and dark environment are valid. Sleep is important, and having light and sound can disrupt that. But the boyfriend is also trying to have his own routine. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is asking for adjustments, which is reasonable if it's affecting their health, like in this case with misophonia. Misophonia is a real condition that causes strong negative reactions to certain sounds, so that's a valid reason to avoid specific ASMR content.\n\nBut wait, did the author approach this in a respectful way? They mentioned showing the study, which is a good step to explain their feelings. The boyfriend's reaction was to put in earphones, which is a solution he found on his own. That might indicate he's making an effort. However, the author is repeatedly asking for adjustments, which might be frustrating for the boyfriend. The question is whether the author is being reasonable or if they're overstepping.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). From what I can see, the author is advocating for their own well-being, which is important. They provided a study to back up their feelings, showing they tried to communicate the issue effectively. The boyfriend's response suggests he's making adjustments. The author's requests seem necessary for their mental health, so they're not being unreasonable. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure (ASMR) might be a factor, but the author's health and comfort come first. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
