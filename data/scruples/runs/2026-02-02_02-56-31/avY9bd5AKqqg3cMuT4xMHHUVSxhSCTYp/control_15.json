I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So, the author is a person who lives with their boyfriend and they're trying to sleep, but he uses his laptop with ASMR, which they find irritating. They ask him to turn down the sound and brightness, and he's resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a quiet and dark environment to sleep. Misophonia, especially related to whispering in ASMR, is a real condition that can cause anxiety and discomfort. The author has explained their feelings and even shown research, which shows they're trying to communicate their needs clearly. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's aware of the issue and is trying to accommodate, but maybe not in a way that fully addresses the problem.\n\nBut wait, moving in together means both need to adjust. The boyfriend's bedtime routine is his \"guilty pleasure,\" so he might be finding it hard to give up. However, the author's health and well-being are important. Chronic sleep disruption can lead to health issues. The key here is whether the author's requests are reasonable and if the boyfriend is making a good-faith effort.\n\nThe author isn't demanding to stop all activities, just to lower the volume and brightness, and avoid whispering ASMR. That's a reasonable ask. The boyfriend's response of using earphones when the author shows research indicates he respects her feelings, but maybe the placement of the laptop under the covers isn't enough. The author has tried to explain their condition, so it's not just about being sensitive; it's a medical issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be feeling his needs aren't being considered. But since the author is the one sleeping in the same room, their needs are directly affected. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're setting boundaries to protect their health. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" might be part of the conflict, but the author has the right to a peaceful sleep environment.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being and have made their needs clear. The boyfriend, while trying to adjust, might need to find more effective solutions, but the author's actions are justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
