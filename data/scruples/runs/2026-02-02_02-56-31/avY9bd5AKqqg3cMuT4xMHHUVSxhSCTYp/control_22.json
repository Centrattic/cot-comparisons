I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, and for expressing discomfort with ASMR, especially whispering ones. They moved in together, so that's a new living arrangement. The author's bedtime needs are silence and darkness, while the boyfriend has a different routine involving YouTube or ASMR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is important for their well-being. They're communicating their needs, which is healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has his own habits that he enjoys. But when those habits interfere with the partner's comfort, there's a responsibility to make adjustments.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and using earphones\u2014suggests he's trying to comply. The author provided a study about misophonia and ASMR, which shows they're making an effort to explain their feelings. Misophonia is a real condition, so the discomfort isn't just a personal preference but a medical issue. That adds weight to the author's request.\n\nHowever, the author is repeatedly asking for things every night. If the boyfriend is consistently non-compliant or resistant, there might be an issue. But the problem here seems to be that the author's needs are being met through the boyfriend's adjustments. The key is whether the communication is respectful and if both parties are making compromises.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're expressing their needs and the boyfriend is taking steps to accommodate, it doesn't seem like the author is being unreasonable. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but when it affects his partner, he should adjust. The author isn't forbidding it entirely but is asking for adjustments to their shared space. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
