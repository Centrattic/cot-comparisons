  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. They need silence and darkness to sleep, while he uses his laptop with ASMR, which they find uncomfortable because of misophonia. They've shown research about it, and he responds by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I should consider their needs. The user has a legitimate health issue with misophonia, which is a real condition causing anxiety and discomfort. They've communicated their needs clearly and provided evidence, which is good. The boyfriend's reaction is to put on earphones, which suggests he's trying to accommodate. But the user is concerned that they're being too demanding.\n\nOn the other hand, moving in together requires compromise. The user is setting boundaries for their well-being, which is important. But maybe they could explore other solutions together, like using a white noise machine or separate sleep schedules. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they're advocating for their health and have explained the issue, it's not unreasonable. The boyfriend's response seems respectful. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
