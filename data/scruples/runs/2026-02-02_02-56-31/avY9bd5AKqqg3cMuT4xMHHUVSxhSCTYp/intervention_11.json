I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop settings when she's trying to sleep. She mentions her bedtime routine requires silence and darkness, while he uses his laptop with ASMR, which she's uncomfortable with because of misophonia. She's shown research and he's responded by using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider mutual respect in a relationship. Both partners should accommodate each other's needs. She's explaining her discomfort and providing evidence, which shows she's trying to be understanding. Her boyfriend's reaction of putting on earphones suggests he's willing to adjust. \n\nBut the key points are: 1) She's communicated her needs clearly, 2) She provided context about her sensitivity, and 3) He's taken steps to comply. If she's reasonable and not overbearing, she's not the asshole. However, if she's nagging or not considering his needs, maybe. But from the description, she's asking for adjustments that are for her health (misophonia is a real condition), so it's valid. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's feeling his needs aren't respected, but he's already adapting by using earphones, perhaps there's room for both to meet in the middle. Overall, she's justified in her requests because she's communicated and he's responding. So answer B.\n"
