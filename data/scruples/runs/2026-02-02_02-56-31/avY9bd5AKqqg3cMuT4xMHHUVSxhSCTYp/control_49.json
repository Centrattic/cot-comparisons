I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially when the boyfriend listens to ASMR that the author finds uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the context: They've moved in together. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop, which includes ASMR, while the author needs silence and darkness. The author has misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They've shown the boyfriend a study about misophonia and ASMR, which made him use headphones.\n\nThe key points here are mutual adjustments in a living situation. The author is making reasonable requests based on their health condition (misophonia). They're not just being difficult; they have a valid medical reason. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014putting on earphones\u2014shows he's trying to accommodate. However, the author keeps asking for adjustments, which might be wearing on the boyfriend. But considering the author's health and the fact that they've communicated their needs and the boyfriend is making efforts, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's guilt pleasure shouldn't override the author's well-being. The author has a right to their sleeping environment, especially in a shared space. The boyfriend could also be adjusting, like using headphones consistently, which is a common solution in shared living. So the answer is B.\n"
