I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and her boyfriend moved in together. She needs a quiet and dark environment to sleep, while he uses his laptop with ASMR and YouTube stuff at night. She often asks him to lower the sound and brightness, which he doesn't like. She also told him about her misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which makes her anxious. He reacted by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is trying to adjust to her partner's habits, which she knew beforehand. She's not being unreasonable by asking for adjustments to her sleep environment. Misophonia is a real condition, and her discomfort is legitimate. She's communicated her needs clearly, even providing a study to help him understand. His reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe without fully engaging in the conversation.\n\nIs she wrong? She's setting boundaries for her well-being. Since they live together, both need to compromise. If he's not respecting her boundaries or not making an effort beyond just using earphones (which might isolate him but doesn't address her needs), that could be on him. However, if she's not considering his needs or not finding a middle ground, that could be an issue. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. She's explaining her actions and the health aspect, which seems valid. He's the one avoiding interaction by using earphones instead of discussing further. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
