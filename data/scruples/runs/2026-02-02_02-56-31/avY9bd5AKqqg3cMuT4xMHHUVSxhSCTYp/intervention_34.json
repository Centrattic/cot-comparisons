  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. They need silence and darkness, but he uses his laptop with ASMR, which they find uncomfortable. They've communicated their feelings and shown research about misophonia. The boyfriend's reaction was to roll away and use earphones.\n\nFirst, the user is clear about their needs from the start. They moved in together, so setting boundaries is normal. They tried to accommodate by letting him watch, but it's still bothering them. They explain their discomfort with whispering ASMR, which is a legitimate issue if they have misophonia. They shared a study, showing they're making an effort to explain their side.\n\nThe boyfriend's response of using earphones suggests he's trying to comply. However, the user is consistently asking for adjustments every night, which might be frustrating for him. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The user isn't forbidding him entirely but wants adjustments for their comfort. Since they've discussed it and he's making efforts, the user isn't in the wrong. It's about finding a balance, but the user's needs are valid here. So answer B.\n"
