  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they live with their boyfriend, and they have different bedtime routines. The boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disruptive, especially the whispering ASMR. The author has to ask him to lower the volume or brightness, and even mentioned showing a study about their misophonia. The boyfriend responds by rolling away and using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is important for their well-being. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own habits and preferences. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable.\n\nThe author isn't banning the boyfriend from using his laptop; they just want adjustments. They've tried to communicate their discomfort and even provided evidence (the study) to explain why whispering ASMR is problematic. The boyfriend's reaction is to put in earphones, which seems like a reasonable compromise, but the author might feel that the boyfriend isn't being considerate enough.\n\nHowever, the author is being consistent in their requests, which is important. It's a living situation, so both need to make adjustments. The question is whether the author's requests are justified. Since they have a medical condition (misophonia) that's triggered, it's a valid reason. The boyfriend could be more accommodating by using earphones or adjusting his routine to minimize disturbances. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're advocating for their health and comfort. The boyfriend's resistance might be part of the issue. So, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B makes sense."
