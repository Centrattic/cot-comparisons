  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong here. They live with their boyfriend and have different bedtime routines. The user needs silence and darkness, while he likes watching YouTube or listening to ASMR. They ask him to turn down the sound and brightness, and when he does ASMR with whispering, they get anxious and show him a study about misophonia. The boyfriend reacts by rolling over and putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, the user is in a shared living space, so they have a right to their own environment. Their needs are about health and comfort. Misophonia is a real condition, so it's not just being picky. They're not just being sensitive; it's a genuine reaction. The boyfriend's behavior, while his personal preference, affects the user's well-being. They communicated their needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's response of using earphones seems like he's accommodating. The user isn't being unreasonable because they're addressing their legitimate needs. The boyfriend isn't respecting their space if he continues despite being asked. The user isn't the asshole here; they're setting boundaries for their health. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
