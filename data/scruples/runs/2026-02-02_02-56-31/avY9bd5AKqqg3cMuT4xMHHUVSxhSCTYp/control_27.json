I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the woman who wrote this is in the wrong. She's moving in with her boyfriend, and they have conflicting bedtime routines. She needs silence and darkness, but he uses his laptop with ASMR, which she finds uncomfortable because she has misophonia, especially with whispering.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger negative emotions. The author has shown her boyfriend a study about it, and he responded by putting in earphones. That makes sense because she's communicating her needs. But the boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being respected. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is clearly stating her discomfort, which is valid. She's not just being picky; it's a health issue. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his relaxation method is being restricted. But when someone has a medical condition that affects them, it's reasonable to accommodate it. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA). The answer usually depends on whether both parties are making efforts. The author has tried to explain her situation and shown research. The boyfriend adjusted by using earphones. However, maybe there's a middle ground. Like, he could use headphones or move to another room. But the author isn't demanding he stop entirely; she's asking him to adjust. \n\nAlso, moving in together means compromising. If the boyfriend is rolling over and using earphones after being asked, he's making an effort. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The problem is the ongoing conflict between their routines. But since the author has a valid medical reason, and the boyfriend is adapting, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong). Both need to continue communicating and finding solutions, but she's justified in her requests.\n"
