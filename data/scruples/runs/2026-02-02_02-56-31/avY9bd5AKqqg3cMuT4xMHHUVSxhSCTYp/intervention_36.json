  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening habits so they can sleep. They mention having misophonia specifically with whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has a legitimate health concern\u2014misophonia is a real condition that can cause distress. They've communicated this to their partner and even shared a study. It's important to respect someone's health needs in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he enjoys. But when one person's routine negatively affects the other's well-being, adjustments are necessary. The user isn't just being finicky; they're dealing with actual physical and emotional reactions. They're also trying to find a balance by suggesting compromises like turning down the volume or using earphones.\n\nMoving in together often requires both partners to make adjustments. The user isn't unreasonable here. They're setting boundaries to protect their health, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate, but maybe not fully understanding the severity of the issue.\n\nSo, considering the health aspect and the communication efforts, the user isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being, which is essential in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
