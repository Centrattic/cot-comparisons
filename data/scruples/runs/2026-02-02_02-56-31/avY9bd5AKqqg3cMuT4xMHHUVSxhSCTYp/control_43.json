I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR consumption when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop in bed with ASMR, which the author finds irritating due to misophonia. The author asks him to turn down the volume, brightness, etc., and shared a study about misophonia, which made the boyfriend use earphones.\n\nThe key points here are the author's health issue (misophonia) and their reasonable request for a better sleep environment. Misophonia is a recognized condition, so the author's discomfort isn't just about being fussy. They're not outright banning the boyfriend from his routine but asking for adjustments that respect their needs. The boyfriend's response was to put earphones in, which shows he's trying to comply without causing issues. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? They're communicating their needs and making compromises. The boyfriend's actions after being shown the study indicate he's willing to adapt. There's no evidence the author is overstepping; they're seeking a solution that works for both. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
