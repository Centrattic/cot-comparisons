I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend's bedtime habits conflicting with the author's needs. \n\nThe author and her boyfriend just moved in together. She needs silence and darkness for sleep, but he uses his laptop with ASMR or YouTube videos, which she finds irritating. She's asking him to turn down the sound and brightness, and she's told him about her misophonia related to whispering ASMR. He's reacting by rolling over or using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has legitimate health concerns\u2014misophonia can be a real issue causing anxiety and discomfort. She's communicated this to her partner and provided research. Her actions are to maintain her own well-being, which is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine. Moving in together often requires compromise. The question is whether the author is overstepping by constantly asking him to adjust his habits. But given that her comfort is affecting her health, it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. She's not demanding he stop his habits entirely but is asking for adjustments that don't interfere with her sleep. Since he's complying (by using earphones), it seems like he's making an effort. The author isn't being unreasonable here; she's advocating for her needs, which are valid. \n\nThe answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's addressing a legitimate issue and seeking a solution that respects both parties' needs. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate he's not fully empathetic, but that's his responsibility to address, not hers.\n"
