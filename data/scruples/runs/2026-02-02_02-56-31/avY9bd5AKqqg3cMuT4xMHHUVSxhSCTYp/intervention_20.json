  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption at night. They mention they need silence and darkness for sleep, while he prefers to watch YouTube or listen to ASMR. They've tried to communicate their discomfort, especially with whispering ASMR, which they have misophonia for. The boyfriend reacts by rolling away and using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The user has valid needs for a good night's sleep, which is important for health. They moved in together, so setting clear boundaries makes sense. Misophonia is a real condition, and the user has explained their sensitivity with a study, which is a reasonable approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine. The user is asking him to change it, which he's doing (using earphones), but maybe he feels his preferences aren't being respected. The key here is whether the user's actions are reasonable. Since they're living together, it's a shared space, and adjusting for each other's needs is part of a relationship. The user isn't forbidding him from doing it entirely, just in their shared space. They're asking for adjustments that don't intrude on their health. The boyfriend's reaction (using earphones) shows he's making an effort, so maybe the user isn't in the wrong. They are advocating for their well-being, which is important. However, maybe they could explore compromises further, like using separate rooms for bedtime routines, but the current situation seems justified. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
