I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening when they're trying to sleep.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together. The boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness at night. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep. They've tried asking him to turn things down, use earphones, etc. He doesn't like it. The ASMR issue is because the author has misophonia, which makes whispering ASMR uncomfortable. They showed him a study, and he used earphones.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The author is setting boundaries for their own needs, which is important. They mention that they have a specific condition (misophonia) that makes certain sounds uncomfortable. They've tried to communicate this to their partner, who has responded by using earphones. That seems like a compromise. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is his bedtime routine, which is a personal preference. However, when shared living space is involved, mutual adjustments are necessary. The author isn't forbidding him entirely from doing his routine but is asking for adjustments that accommodate their needs. \n\nIt's important to consider both parties' reasonable needs. The author's request seems reasonable to create a peaceful sleep environment. The boyfriend's response of using earphones addresses the problem without completely restricting his activity. \n\nThere's no indication that the author is being overly controlling or unreasonable. They've made efforts to communicate and find solutions. The boyfriend's initial resistance might be frustration, but the fact that he complied when shown the study suggests he's trying to accommodate. \n\nNo signs of the author violating any norms. It's about mutual respect and compromise. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
