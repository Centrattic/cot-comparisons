  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they are the asshole for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. They also mention that ASMR, especially whispering, makes them anxious and irritated. They moved in together and have different bedtime routines. The boyfriend's usual routine is to watch YouTube or ASMR, while the user needs silence and darkness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The user is in their own home now they've moved in together, so their needs for a quiet and dark environment are valid. Misophonia is a real condition, and if a study supports that, then their reaction isn't just being picky. They've communicated their feelings and even showed a study, which shows they're being considerate and not unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is also in a shared space, so his habits might need some adjustment. The user isn't outright banning him from doing ASMR, just asking for it to be quieter and the brightness down. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to put on earphones when shown the study suggests he's willing to accommodate, which is positive. But the user is being asked if they're in the wrong for repeatedly making these requests. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The user has explained their discomfort and provided evidence, which is a mature approach. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure (ASMR) might indicate he's aware it's important to him. However, the user is asking if they're the asshole for \"pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me.\" Since they've made their needs known and it's affecting their sleep and mental health, it's reasonable for them to ask for adjustments. \n\nIn a new living situation, it's common for couples to work out differences. The user isn't being hostile, just firm about their needs. The boyfriend's job is to be accommodating, especially if he wants to maintain a good relationship. Since the user provided a study and the boyfriend took action, it seems they're both trying to find a solution. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No). They're not in the wrong because they're advocating for their well-being and have communicated their needs clearly. The boyfriend should be adjusting to their environment as they adjust to his. It's a mutual adjustment period, and the user's actions are justified.\n"
