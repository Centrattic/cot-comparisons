I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage at night because it's disturbing their sleep. They mention needing silence and darkness, while he uses his laptop with ASMR, which they have a sensitivity to (misophonia). They've tried to communicate this, shown him a study, and he's responsive when he puts in earphones.\n\nFirst, consider the context of a new living situation. They moved in together, so establishing boundaries is part of the adjustment. The user's needs are valid\u2014needing a quiet, dark environment to sleep is pretty standard. They're not just being finicky; they have a documented sensitivity (misophonia) which explains their reaction to whispering. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is important. He listened when they showed him the study and put earphones in, which suggests he's trying to accommodate. The user isn't just asking for personal preference; they're addressing a health-related issue. However, the user might be overstepping if they're not equally considering his needs. But since they're in a new shared space, mutual adjustments are necessary.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The user is clearly communicating their needs and providing evidence of their sensitivity. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he's making an effort. The user isn't being unreasonable in asking for adjustments that help them sleep. They\u2019re not forbidding him from doing these things entirely, just modifying how and when he does them. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend feels his needs are being ignored or if the user is not making any effort to understand his routine, that could tip the balance. But from the description, the user is making an effort to explain their discomfort and find solutions. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re advocating for their health and well-being while trying to coexist. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
