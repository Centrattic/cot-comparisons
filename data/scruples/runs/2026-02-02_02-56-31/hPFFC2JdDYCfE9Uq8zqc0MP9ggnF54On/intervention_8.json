It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, he craved pizza from a specific place, ordered it, and offered to get his girlfriend something. She said she'd just have some of whatever he got. Then he took two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen a while, came back without eating. When he discovered she had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces, he got angry. She was confused, said it's fine, and he called her selfish. She told him to stop acting like a child, leading to a bigger argument.\n\nSo, the key points here. The user ordered pizza for himself, knowing she was going to have some of it. He took two slices, then when he went to get more, he found that all the remaining pizza had toppings stripped. His anger comes from feeling that she was being selfish. The girlfriend thought it was okay because it's still edible, and he's overreacting. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, he ordered the pizza for his own craving, but he did offer to get her something, and she said she'd have some of his. Maybe he expected her to take a piece or part of a piece, but she took from all, leaving nothing but the crusts. That's inconsiderate, perhaps. But is his reaction justified?\n\nHe called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. She felt he was overreacting. The user is trying to justify his anger, but maybe the fight was over a trivial matter. However, his perception of her actions as selfish could be valid. The problem might be in communication. He might have expected her to take a piece, but she did the opposite. Maybe he should have checked or communicated better, but she didn't inform him what she was doing. \n\nBut then again, the value of the situation is subjective. What's a big deal to one person is minor to another. If they have a history of such issues, maybe, but this seems like an isolated incident. The user might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but perhaps overreacted. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, even if she thought it's still fine. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
