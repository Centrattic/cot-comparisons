It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The person ordered a specific pizza they wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said no but would have some of what they get. Then, when the pizza arrives, the person takes two slices and starts watching TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, the person asks why she's not eating. She says she took toppings off all the slices. The person gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the expectations. The person ordered the pizza because they were starving, and the girlfriend agreed to have some of whatever they got. So maybe the person expected the pizza to be shared as ordered. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since she didn't order anything, she could adjust the pizza as she saw fit. But she did take from all the slices, which could have left the person with less than they wanted or liked.\n\nBut was the person in the wrong for getting angry? The girlfriend did say she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The person assumed she took a few, but she took from all. That could be seen as not respecting the other's order. However, maybe the girlfriend didn't think it was a big deal and was trying to save money or adjust the pizza to her taste. The person called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might have been an overreaction, but the girlfriend's action could also be seen as selfish. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The person didn't specify that they didn't want her to take toppings, and the girlfriend didn't clarify if she meant taking a small amount or adjusting all slices. So, maybe both parties had misunderstandings. However, the person's reaction was to call the girlfriend names and argue, which might have been too harsh. On the other hand, taking toppings from every piece without asking could be inconsiderate. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. But since the person didn't communicate their expectations clearly and reacted angrily, maybe they are partially at fault. However, the girlfriend's action was also inconsiderate. But the question is specifically if the person is in the wrong. The answer might depend on societal expectations. In many cases, people might side with the person because they paid for the pizza and wanted to eat it as ordered. So the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the person's anger is justified. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But if the person's reaction was overly aggressive, even if justified, maybe A. But the main issue is the girlfriend's action. So maybe B.\n"
