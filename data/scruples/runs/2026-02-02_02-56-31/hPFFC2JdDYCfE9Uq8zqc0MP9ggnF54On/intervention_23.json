It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user ordered pizza for himself and his girlfriend, who initially said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ate two pieces, then went to the kitchen and found all the toppings removed from every slice. She said she didn't take all the cheese, just some toppings. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, did he do something wrong? He ordered pizza, which he paid for, and assumed it was for both of them. She didn't eat anything and then took toppings from all the slices. But maybe he should have considered that she might not like the toppings. However, he ordered it for both, so if he knew she didn't like something, maybe he should have ordered separate items. But he didn't know that, right? He thought she would have toppings.\n\nOn her side, she didn't eat anything and then modified the pizza. That seems inconsiderate because he was paying for it and she changed it without asking. But maybe she had a reason, like disliking certain toppings. However, modifying all the pizza might be excessive. \n\nHe got angry, called her selfish, and she felt he was overreacting. The key here is communication. He didn't ask if she wanted it before ordering, but she said she would have some. Then she didn't take any, which could be a problem. But when he did eat, she altered the pizza, which he found unacceptable. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. He might have been inconsiderate by not considering her dislikes when ordering, but she also modified the food he paid for without consent. Neither side is entirely wrong. But since he got angry over her actions, maybe he overreacted, but she did act inconsiderately. The answer might be a mix, but according to the options, it's A or B. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because his reaction is understandable given the situation, but maybe A if he should have communicated better. I think it's more B because she altered the food without asking, so his anger is valid.\n"
