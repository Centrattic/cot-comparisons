It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza they really wanted, and their girlfriend said she would just eat some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to the living room, and when he checked the kitchen later, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was looking forward to the pizza and ordered it. The girlfriend agreed to eat what he ordered, so maybe she expected that the pizza would be shared in a way that both could enjoy it. When he took two pieces, maybe she thought she could have the rest, but instead, she modified all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. But why did she do that? Maybe she didn't like the toppings and didn't want to eat them, so she tried to adjust the pizza to her taste without considering that he might want to eat the whole pizza as is.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the argument. The girlfriend might have felt that since he had already taken two pieces, she was entitled to adjust the remaining pizza however she wanted. She might not have intended to take all the cheese and toppings, just some, but from the author's perspective, taking from every piece was unacceptable. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to be angry? The pizza was expensive, and he was looking forward to it. He might have felt that she was being inconsiderate by altering the pizza he paid for. However, the girl did offer to eat the same pizza, so maybe she thought she could adjust it to her preferences. But in doing so, she made the pizza less enjoyable for him. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't clarify that he wanted the pizza prepared as is, and she didn't ask if she could modify it. The argument could have been avoided if there was clearer communication. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces without discussing it might be seen as selfish, especially if the author expected them to share the same pizza without altering it. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for getting angry? Maybe not. It's understandable to be upset if someone messes with your food you paid for. However, his reaction was to call her names and argue, which contributed to the conflict. The girlfriend might have handled it better by not altering the pizza without asking. So, maybe both have some responsibility here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he overreacted, then maybe A. But if her actions were inconsiderate, then B.\n\nI think the main issue is that the girlfriend took it upon herself to modify the pizza without considering the author's preferences, which is inconsiderate. The author's anger, while perhaps intense, is a reaction to that inconsideration. So the author might not be in the wrong. But maybe the argument was over a minor issue, and the author overreacted. The answer depends on whether the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish or if the author's reaction was disproportionate.\n"
