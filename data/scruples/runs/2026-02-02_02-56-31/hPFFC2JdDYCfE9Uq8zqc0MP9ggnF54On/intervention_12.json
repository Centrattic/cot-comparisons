It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that they ordered pizza from an expensive place they really wanted, told their girlfriend they were getting it, and she said she'd have some of whatever. Then when the pizza arrived, they took two pieces, went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, she said she took toppings and cheese off every piece. The person got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. So, the person is wondering if their anger was justified. Let me break it down. First, they ordered the pizza because they were craving it and it's a pricier place. They asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, she said no but would have some of whatever. The problem is that she took toppings off all the pieces, which the person saw as selfish. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The girlfriend thought she could take some toppings without the person noticing. The person thought she meant she'd take toppings from one or two pieces, but she did all of them. Then when confronted, she was confused why he was angry, saying he already had his pieces and it's still edible. The person felt the girlfriend was inconsiderate.\n\nNow, is the person in the wrong? Well, maybe they should have considered that the girlfriend might want to modify the pizza to her taste. But on the other hand, the person paid for it, was looking forward to it, and the girlfriend didn't ask for permission. However, the argument escalated quickly. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as not respecting the person's preferences. But since the person didn't specify that they wanted the pizza untouched, maybe the girlfriend didn't realize it was important. \n\nBut the person also didn't check if the girlfriend was taking some before eating their own. They just assumed she took toppings off a couple of pieces. So maybe the person overreacted. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay to adjust the pizza since she said she'd have some of whatever. So perhaps the person is in the wrong for getting angry without confirming and for calling her selfish immediately. Alternatively, the girlfriend didn't consider the person's feelings when modifying the pizza they specifically wanted. \n\nI think the key points are: did the person communicate their expectations? They didn't mention that they wanted the pizza untouched. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay to adjust it. However, modifying all the pizza without asking could be seen as inconsiderate. But the person's reaction was also harsh. So maybe both sides have some responsibility. But since the question is whether the person is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether their anger was justified. If they didn't specify that the pizza shouldn't be altered, then their anger over the modifications might be their fault for not setting boundaries. On the other hand, the girlfriend should have asked before modifying the pizza. Hmm. I'm leaning towards the person not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate without communication. But maybe the person could have been more understanding. It's a tough call. But the answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Given the situation, maybe the person is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were selfish without asking. But maybe the person overreacted by calling her selfish immediately. I think it's a bit of both, but since the options are only A or B, probably B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. But maybe the person didn't need to react so strongly. Hmm. It's a close call.\n"
