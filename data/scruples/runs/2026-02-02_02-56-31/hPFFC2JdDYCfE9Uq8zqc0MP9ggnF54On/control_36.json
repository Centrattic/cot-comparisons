It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, and left it. The girlfriend took off toppings and cheese from all the pieces, not just one or two. The author is upset that she did this and called her selfish, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza for himself and asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, which she declined. Then he ate two slices and left the rest. The girlfriend went into the kitchen and came back without eating anything. When the author went to the kitchen, he found all the toppings and cheese taken off the remaining slices. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he ordered the pizza with the intention of eating it himself, right? But he did ask his girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she would have some of whatever he got. So maybe he expected her to take some slices, but instead she took off toppings from all the pieces. The girlfriend might have thought that since he had already eaten two slices, the rest were fair game for her to modify as she wanted. But the author was upset because he thought she was being inconsiderate by making the remaining pizza inedible or reducing his share.\n\nBut wait, the author only ate two slices himself. If the pizza was ordered as a shared meal, maybe he should have considered that. However, the girlfriend said she didn't want anything, so maybe the author assumed she wasn't going to eat it. But then she went into the kitchen and took toppings off, which the author found inconsiderate. The girlfriend might feel that since he had already eaten, she was allowed to take what she wanted from the leftovers. But the problem is that she took all the toppings and cheese off every piece, making them less than ideal to eat. The author's anger might stem from feeling that his food was ruined, and his partner wasn't respecting his order.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might think that since the pizza was in the shared space, she could take what she wanted. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza for himself alone. So maybe he's at fault for not clarifying that he wanted to eat it all himself. If he had mentioned that he was ordering it specifically for himself and didn't want her to touch it, then she might have known. But he just ordered it and assumed she would take some if she wanted. So perhaps the author overreacted because he didn't set boundaries, and the girlfriend took it as an open invitation.\n\nBut the key point is that the girlfriend took toppings and cheese off all the pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. If she had taken a few toppings off a couple of slices, maybe it wouldn't have been a big deal. But taking all toppings and cheese off every piece suggests she wanted to use the toppings for something else, maybe making a salad or something, which the author found unacceptable. So the author's reaction might be justified if the pizza was an expensive treat he wanted to enjoy, and the girlfriend ruined it for him without considering his feelings.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might not see it that way. She might think that since he had already eaten, and he ordered it for himself, she could do what she wanted with the leftovers. The problem here is communication. The author didn't make it clear that he wanted to eat all the pizza himself, and the girlfriend didn't realize that modifying all the remaining slices was a problem. Both parties might have acted without considering the other's perspective.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author ordered the pizza, but didn't communicate that he intended to eat it all. The girlfriend took what she wanted from the leftovers but in a way that made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for the author. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but he could have been clearer about his intentions. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and starting a fight over this might be a bit over the top. The girlfriend might feel that she was using the leftover pizza as she saw fit, which is her right if it's in their shared space. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not setting boundaries and overreacting.\n\nAlternatively, the author's frustration is understandable if he paid a premium for the pizza expecting to enjoy it, and his partner ruined it without consultation. The extent of the modification (all toppings and cheese off every piece) is extreme, which might justify his anger. However, the girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't realize it was a problem. So maybe both are at fault to some degree, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), then the author is in the wrong for overreacting. If B (No), then the author isn't wrong because the girlfriend was selfish.\n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that if you order food in a shared space, others might expect to use leftovers. However, if you order it with the intent to eat it yourself, you should specify that. Since the author didn't, maybe he's in the wrong. But if the girlfriend went overboard in modifying the pizza, then she's also at fault. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. So if he didn't communicate his wishes clearly, then he might be in the wrong for not setting expectations. However, if the girlfriend's actions were unreasonable, then the author's anger is justified. It's tricky. I think the answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't make it clear that he wanted the pizza for himself, leading to the misunderstanding. But if the answer is B (No), then because the girlfriend was selfish.\n"
