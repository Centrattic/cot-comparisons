It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry about their girlfriend taking toppings off all the pizza pieces. They ordered the pizza expecting to share, but she ended up taking toppings from every slice, leaving it less than they wanted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the user's perspective. They asked if she wanted something, she said she'd just have some of whatever. They assumed that meant she might take a whole slice or part of one. But instead, she took toppings from all slices, which the user found inconsiderate. The user got angry, called her selfish, and the argument escalated. Now they're wondering if they overreacted.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend didn't say anything about taking toppings until after the user started eating. She might have thought it was okay since she didn't take the whole slice. She was confused by the anger and dismissed the user's feelings, which could be part of the problem. But was her action inconsiderate? Taking toppings from all pieces might leave the user with a less enjoyable meal, especially if they were excited about the pizza. The user's reaction might be justified if they felt her action was selfish without communication.\n\nHowever, the user didn't mention discussing the situation calmly first. They ordered the pizza intending to share, but maybe they should have clarified how they wanted to split it. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the user's response was to call her selfish and escalate the argument. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk about it without blame.\n\nBut the user's anger might be valid because their expectation was not respected. The girlfriend didn't ask before modifying the pizza, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the user could have communicated their feelings more constructively instead of lashing out. The key here is whether the user's reaction was proportionate. While the action was inconsiderate, the response of calling her selfish and blowing it out of proportion might make the user at fault for not handling it calmly.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the user had a valid concern, but their reaction style might have been the problem. The answer is likely B, they aren't in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. But since the user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting the fight, the answer might be B because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the user's anger isn't out of proportion.\n"
