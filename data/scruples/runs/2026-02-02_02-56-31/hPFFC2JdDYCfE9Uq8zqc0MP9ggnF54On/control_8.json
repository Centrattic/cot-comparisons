It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they were craving. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and offered her a share. She said she'd just have some of whatever he got. He ate two pieces, then when he went to the kitchen, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the girlfriend agreed to have some of the pizza but didn't specify how she wanted it prepared. The author assumed she meant taking a few toppings off a couple of slices, but she actually removed toppings from all pieces. The author felt this was inconsiderate, while she thought he was overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, they were looking forward to the pizza, invested in getting a specific type, and expected that sharing would be straightforward. The girlfriend's actions made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him. His anger might stem from feeling that she didn't respect his choice or consider his preferences. However, the girlfriend might have thought she was being fair by taking what she wanted, not realizing the impact on the author.\n\nBut is the author at fault? Well, he did order the pizza intending to share, and she did ask for a portion. The problem is that she modified the pizza in a way that affected what he wanted. The author's reaction is about feeling disrespected or unappreciated, but maybe he should have communicated his preference for how the pizza should be handled. Alternatively, she might have asked if she could adjust the pizza instead of doing it without consulting him. However, the author's anger over such an issue might be seen as overreacting, especially since it's just food. But considering the context of his craving and the expense, maybe his reaction is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't take a whole piece, just modified the toppings. The author might have been inconsiderate by not checking if she needed something specific when he ordered. But she did agree to have some of what he got, so perhaps the author's assumption was that she would take a slice as is. The main conflict here is misunderstanding each other's expectations.\n\nIn terms of fault, maybe both parties share some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author called the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which could be seen as escalating the situation. The girlfriend's actions might be inconsiderate, but the author's reaction could be seen as an overreaction. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, the answer depends on whether the author's actions (starting the fight) were justified.\n\nI think the key is that the author ordered the pizza for themselves and offered to share, but the girlfriend altered it without communication. The author's anger is about the modification affecting his meal, which is a valid concern. However, the argument could have been avoided with clearer communication. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe he could have handled it better. However, since the question is about being in the wrong for starting the fight, the answer might be B (Not the author) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. But some might argue the author was too harsh. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B.\n"
