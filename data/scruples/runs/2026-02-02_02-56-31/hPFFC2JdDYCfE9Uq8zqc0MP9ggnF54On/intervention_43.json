It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user was really craving pizza and ordered from an expensive place. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something and she said no, but wanted some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two pieces, and noticed she wasn't eating. When he asked, she said she took toppings and cheese off every piece. The user got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nSo the main points here are communication and expectations. The user thought she was going to take a piece or maybe some toppings from one or two, but she took from all. That's a problem. But was the user's reaction justified?\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they paid for the pizza, maybe it's a treat, and she took from all the pieces without asking. That's inconsiderate, especially if he was expecting to have some left for himself. But maybe the girlfriend thought since he had already taken two pieces, it's okay to take from the rest. She might not have realized how much she took. \n\nThe user's anger might be over a specific value or the principle of someone taking without consent. However, the girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't see it the same way. The argument escalated because of differing expectations. \n\nBut is the user at fault? They did ask if she wanted something, and she said no. Maybe the user should have considered that if she wanted some toppings, he could have offered to split a piece. Alternatively, the girlfriend should have asked before taking from all the pizza. \n\nThe key here is communication. The user might have assumed she would only take a little, while she assumed he had enough. The user's reaction was strong, but the act of taking without permission could be seen as selfish. However, arguments can arise from such misunderstandings. \n\nIn relationships, these small things can lead to bigger issues if not handled well. The user's anger might be reasonable in terms of personal boundaries, but maybe the way they handled it could have been better. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not the argument style. Since the girlfriend took without asking and the user's reaction was to a display of selfishness, the user might feel justified. But others might see it as overreacting. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the user is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend took from the pizza without consent, which is inconsiderate. The user's anger is a reaction to that, but the main fault lies with her actions. So the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
