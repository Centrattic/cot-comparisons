It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's unpack this situation. The person ordered pizza from an expensive place they really wanted, and their girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever they got. He took two slices, went to watch TV, and later found out she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend agreed to have some of his pizza but didn't specify if she wanted a whole slice or not. He assumed she would take toppings off one or two slices. Instead, she took from all, which left the pizza less than ideal for him. He felt betrayed and inconsiderate, while she found his anger over-the-top.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend did take more than what he might have expected. Even if she didn't eat the whole slice, removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as wasteful or disrespectful to his craving. The author's reaction was frustration, but calling her selfish and inconsiderate might be harsh. However, the girlfriend's confusion and dismissing his feelings by saying he's acting like a child could also be a problem. She might not have considered how her actions affected his enjoyment of the pizza. \n\nThe question is whether his anger was justified. Since he had a specific craving for a place he paid extra for, the modification to all the pizza pieces could make the experience less satisfying. The girlfriend didn't follow through with the initial agreement (she said she would have some of his pizza but then altered it in a way he didn't like). The author's anger stems from her not respecting his choice. However, his response might have been too strong. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings without name-calling. But the initial act of removing toppings from all pieces without discussing it could be seen as selfish. The argument about proportions might be tricky because it's subjective. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but his reaction could have been handled better. The main issue is the girlfriend's actions not aligning with the mutual understanding, even if she didn't eat it all. But the question is if he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior, while maybe not malicious, did cause unnecessary conflict and wasn't considerate. The author's anger, though intense, is a reaction to that inconsideration. So the answer might be B, but I need to check if his anger is proportionate. Since he was really craving it and it's an expensive place, maybe the action is a big deal for him. The girlfriend's response of dismissing his feelings is also problematic. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
