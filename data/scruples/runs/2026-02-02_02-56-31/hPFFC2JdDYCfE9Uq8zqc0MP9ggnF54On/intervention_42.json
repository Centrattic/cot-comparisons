It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The user ordered pizza from a specific place, which was expensive but worth it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two pieces, and when he went to the kitchen, he found that his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user was hungry, ordered the pizza, and assumed that when she said she'd have some of whatever he got, she would just take a piece or two. But instead, she removed toppings from all the pieces, which made him angry because he felt she was being selfish and inconsiderate. She, on the other hand, thought that since he had already taken his pieces, it was okay for her to take the toppings off the remaining ones, even though he didn't know that. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The user didn't specify that he wanted the pizza to remain intact for his portions. He just ordered it and assumed she would take a piece if she wanted. However, she interpreted his offer differently and took the toppings instead of a full piece. The user's anger might be justified if he felt that she altered the pizza in a way that affected his enjoyment or the food he had already taken. But then again, maybe she didn't mean to interfere with his portions. \n\nIs it reasonable to get angry over someone taking toppings from the pizza that was ordered for both of them? If she took some toppings off the remaining pieces (after he had his two), maybe that's not so bad. But if she took from all the pieces, including the ones he had already eaten, maybe that's more of an issue. The user might have felt that she was being stingy or not considerate because instead of just taking a piece, she modified the remaining ones. However, the girlfriend might not have realized that her actions would affect his portions, especially since she thought he had already had his. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the user could have been clearer about his expectations when he ordered the pizza. If he wanted to ensure that the pizza wasn't altered, he might have said something like, \"I'm getting this pizza, and I hope you don't mind if it stays as is for my portions.\" But he didn't, and she made her own choice based on her understanding. \n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend might have thought she was saving money or not wanting to eat a whole piece, so taking toppings instead. However, taking chunks of cheese off all the pieces does seem a bit extreme and possibly inconsiderate, especially if it made the pizza less enjoyable for him. \n\nThe argument escalated because he called her selfish and she felt he was overreacting. It's possible that both could have handled the situation better. The user might have overreacted to the situation, but his feelings are valid if he felt disrespected. The girlfriend's actions, while perhaps not malicious, might have been inconsiderate without communication. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the user in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his boundaries and got angry over an action that wasn't explicitly agreed upon, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, if his anger was disproportionate to the situation, then maybe he did overreact. The key is whether the user's reaction was justified given the lack of prior agreement. \n\nI think the answer here is B (Not in the wrong) because the girlfriend altered the pizza in a way that affected the user's consumption without prior discussion. However, the user could have been more explicit about his expectations. But given the scenario, his anger seems somewhat justified as the pizza was ordered for both, and her taking toppings from all pieces might have been inconsiderate, even if she thought she was saving her portions.\n"
