It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. So, I need to analyze the situation presented in the AITA post.\n\nFirst, the guy ordered pizza because he was craving it and asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything. She said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two pieces, and later found out she took toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points here are communication and expectations. When he ordered the pizza, he might have assumed it was for both of them since she said she'd have some. But when she took the toppings off all the pieces, it might have felt like she ruined his meal without considering his preferences. However, he did order the pizza for himself and maybe didn't clarify that she could have a piece or two. \n\nOn the other hand, she might have thought she was being polite by taking just some toppings, not realizing how important the pizza was to him. The problem here is that there was a lack of communication. She didn't ask if it was okay to take the toppings, and he didn't set clear boundaries about not wanting her to alter his food. \n\nBut is the guy in the wrong? If he had ordered the pizza for both, then maybe expecting her to take some. But he ordered it because he wanted it, and she said she'd have some. Then, after he ate his pieces, she altered the remaining ones. So maybe she overstepped by taking toppings off all pieces, not just her own. That could be seen as inconsiderate because she made the pizza he ordered less enjoyable for him. \n\nBut then again, he could have been more considerate in the first place by sharing the pizza. If he was so invested in the pizza, maybe he should have ordered extra or communicated that he wanted his pizza the way it was. His reaction might be a bit over the top, calling her selfish and starting an argument. However, the act of taking toppings off all pieces might have been the real issue because it's his food and she didn't ask. \n\nI think the fault is shared. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), that would mean he's wrong. If B (no), then he's not. Considering that he ordered the pizza for himself, but she altered it without consent, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion might have escalated things. \n\nBut the main point is that she took toppings off all the pizza after he had already eaten his share. That seems like an inconsiderate act, and he had every right to be upset. The problem is whether his reaction was justified. If she took all the toppings, that's his food being altered, so he's not wrong to be angry. \n\nSo I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. The real issue is her taking the toppings without consent, and his reaction, while heated, is a response to her inconsiderate action. The problem is mutual, but the question is about the author's wrongness. Since he was reacting to her action, maybe he's not wrong.\n"
