It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user ordered a pizza from a specific place they really wanted. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. After he ordered, he took two pieces and went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he asked why she didn't eat, she said she took toppings off. He found out she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry. Let's consider a few angles. First, communication: he ordered the pizza and assumed she would have some, but maybe they should have clarified how much she wanted. She might have thought one or two pieces were enough, but he ordered a whole pizza. However, she ended up taking from all pieces, which he found inconsiderate. \n\nBut wait, he did order the pizza for both of them. If she's not eating the whole pizza, maybe she had a reason. However, taking toppings and cheese from all pieces could be seen as altering the food he paid for, which he wasn't happy about. The user felt selfishness and inconsideration, which led to the argument. \n\nIs getting angry over this justified? It's subjective. Some might say it's overreacting, but others might see it as reasonable if he expected to share the pizza as ordered. The key points are communication and expectations. Did he make it clear that he wanted the pizza as is? Did she understand that? Maybe she thought she was saving money by not eating the whole thing, but altering it without discussing it could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe user's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which she found childish. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his expectations were communicated. If he didn't specify that he wanted the pizza untouched, her actions might be within her right. However, if they had a prior understanding that he wanted to share the pizza, her altering it without discussion could be the issue. \n\nIn relationships, conflicts over things like food can be tricky. It's about mutual respect and communication. So, without more context on their usual dynamics, it's a bit of a toss-up. But the user's anger might be a bit out of proportion, especially since it's just pizza. However, if he paid for it and she altered it without asking, that could be a valid point. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his reaction, while intense, is based on her altering food he paid for without discussion. But also, maybe he should have been more considerate of her not wanting the whole pizza. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the key is that he didn't check in again after she said she'd have some of what he got. She might have changed her mind, but he could have asked again. So maybe he's partially at fault for not checking in. But the main issue is her altering the food. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but there's some nuance. Since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, and the situation is about a misunderstanding, maybe the answer is B. But I'm not 100% sure. The user's anger might be justified if he felt disrespected, but the argument might have been over a minor issue. However, the act of altering the food could be seen as selfish, so maybe B is correct.\n"
