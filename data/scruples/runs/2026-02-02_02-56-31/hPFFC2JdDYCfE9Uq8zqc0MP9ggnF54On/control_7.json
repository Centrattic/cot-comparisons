It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ate two pieces, went to watch TV, and when he checked later, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. First, the girlfriend agreed to have some of the pizza he ordered. She might have thought that meant she could take a little from each piece, not realizing that he expected the pizza to be there for him. But the author ordered it because he was starving and it's a specific place he likes. He paid for it, right? Wait, did he pay for it himself? The story says he asked her if she wanted anything, implying he was ordering for both. But if he paid for it, then maybe she had the right to take some. But she took toppings off every piece, which might have made the pizza less enjoyable for him.\n\nThe author's anger comes from feeling that she was selfish, taking what she wanted without considering his preferences. But she might have thought that since he had already taken two pieces, the rest was fair game. However, removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if he was looking forward to eating them as they were. The girlfriend's confusion and defensiveness might have escalated the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overreacted. It's just pizza, and she took a portion. But the way she modified every piece could have been a problem. The author might have assumed she took a little from a few pieces, but instead, she did it to all. The argument might have been avoidable if he had discussed his expectations earlier. But given that he asked if she wanted anything and she said yes, maybe she thought she could take what she wanted. \n\nI think the key points are: did the author have a right to expect the pizza to remain untouched? If he ordered it for both, maybe she had the right to take some. But she modified all the pieces, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's anger might be justified because the pizza was a specific craving, and she altered it beyond what he expected. However, he could have communicated better, maybe specifying how he wanted the pizza prepared or checking if she was okay with it before modifying it. \n\nSo, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author's anger isn't entirely out of line. But maybe the author could have handled it without yelling. However, the question is about being in the wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's actions, but the author initiated the fight. But maybe he's not wrong to feel upset. The answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong because her actions were selfish, and he had a right to be upset. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) if the author overreacted. It's tricky. I think the author isn't entirely wrong because her actions were inconsiderate. But maybe the author could have handled it better. Hmm. The answer might be B.\n"
