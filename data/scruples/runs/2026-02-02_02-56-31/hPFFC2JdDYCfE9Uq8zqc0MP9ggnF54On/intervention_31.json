It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user ordered pizza for himself, asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV, and later found out she took the toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend agreed to eat some of the pizza he ordered. He didn't order anything for her, so maybe he should have bought two pizzas or checked if she wanted her own. But she said she'd have some of his, so maybe she expected to share his order. However, when she went to the kitchen, he didn't notice. When he did check, he found she removed toppings from all pieces, which he considered selfish. She argued she didn't take all the cheese and that he already had his pieces.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he ordered food she wanted to eat, but he didn't specify that the pizza was only for him. If she agreed to eat his order, maybe she expected to share. But removing toppings from all pieces might be inconsiderate, especially if he was eating those pieces. However, he did take two pieces right away, leaving the rest. Maybe he could have offered her a slice before taking his own. But he thought she wanted some of what he got, so maybe she expected to take from the remaining pizza. She might have thought taking toppings was her way of eating it without him needing to give her a whole slice. \n\nBut she didn't communicate her actions. If he took two pieces and left the rest, she could have asked for a slice. Removing toppings from all pieces without his knowledge could be seen as selfish, especially if he was eating the remaining. However, he didn't mention he wanted to keep the toppings on. Maybe he assumed the pizza was shared, but she might have thought she could modify it. \n\nHe got angry over her modifying the pizza without asking, which could be a valid reaction since the pizza was ordered for both. But calling her selfish and inconsiderate might be an overreaction, especially if she didn't take all the toppings and he didn't clarify his expectations. The key points are communication and expectations. He didn't set boundaries about the pizza being his alone, and she might have expected to use it. However, removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as selfish, but the argument could have been avoided with better communication. So, maybe both have some responsibility, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he ordered the pizza with the intention that she could have some, but then got angry when she modified it without asking, he might be partly at fault for not being clear. However, her actions were inconsiderate. The answer might be that he's not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps both share some responsibility. However, the question asks if he's in the wrong. Since he didn't order the pizza exclusively for himself and she modified it without communication, he might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
