It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza between a guy and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The guy was craving pizza from an expensive place, ordered it, and offered it to his girlfriend. She initially said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he took two pieces, went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while, came back without eating. He asked why and found out she took toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me think. The guy ordered pizza he wanted, which he paid for. He offered it to his girlfriend, who accepted. Then when she took toppings off all the pieces, he felt it was selfish. The girlfriend thought it was fine because he had already eaten. The guy is upset about the display of selfishness. \n\nPossible angles: Did he have an obligation to share? Did she overstep by modifying all the pizza? Was he being inconsiderate by not saving some for her? Or was she being inconsiderate by taking toppings off all the pieces, making it less enjoyable for him? \n\nThe guy ordered the pizza because he wanted it, but maybe he should have considered that sharing it would require some planning. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece might be rude, as it alters the food he wanted to eat. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe the guy should have communicated that he wanted to eat the pizza as it was. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay since she didn't take all the pizza. However, modifying someone's food without asking is generally not acceptable. \n\nSo, the girlfriend's action was probably inconsiderate. The guy's anger might be a reaction to that. But is his anger disproportionate? He called her selfish and they had a big argument. Maybe the guy overreacted, but the action itself (removing toppings from all pieces) is pretty bad. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the guy is right to be upset because she altered his food. However, the question is about whether he is in the wrong. If the girl did something wrong, then he isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's action was inappropriate, and his reaction, while perhaps heated, is a response to her inconsiderate act. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
