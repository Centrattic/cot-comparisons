It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, he really wanted pizza and ordered it from a specific place because he thought it was worth the extra cost. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he took two pieces and went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he noticed she wasn't eating, he asked. She said she did, taking toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and assumptions. He thought she was just taking some toppings off a couple of slices, but she actually did it to all. He felt his order was for both of them, but maybe there was a misunderstanding. Did he make it clear that the pizza was for both? He asked if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Maybe he assumed that meant she'd share the pizza as is, but she didn't like the toppings and modified them all.\n\nOn his end, he might have overreacted. The pizza was expensive, and he was craving it, so maybe he felt it was being ruined. But she didn't tell him she didn't like it or wanted to modify it. He could have been more explicit about his expectations. However, her taking all the toppings off without discussing it could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe argument escalated because he called her selfish, which is a strong term. That might have been out of proportion, but his frustration is understandable. On the other hand, if she had asked or communicated her dislike of the toppings, maybe the issue could have been resolved without a fight. \n\nSo, who's at fault? Maybe both. He could have been clearer about his expectations, and she could have communicated her needs. But the question is asking if the user is in the wrong. Since the fight started because of his reaction to her modifying the pizza, and he used harsh language, he might share some responsibility. However, her actions were also inconsiderate without prior discussion. \n\nI think the answer is a bit of both, but since the options are A or B, and the user is asking specifically if they are in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (they are not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. But maybe the user could have handled it better. Hmm. Difficult. Alternatively, since the user escalated the situation by calling her selfish, that's his fault. So maybe A. But I'm not sure. The answer depends on who started the fight. He did, but maybe the conflict was due to both parties not communicating. However, the options are binary. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his anger was a response to her inconsiderate action, but the answer might be A if the user's reaction was unreasonable. This is tricky. Maybe B.\n"
