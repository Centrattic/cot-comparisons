It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry over their girlfriend modifying the pizza without asking.\n\nSo, the situation is: he ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because he was craving it. He asked her if she wanted anything, she said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. Then when the pizza arrived, he took two slices. She was in the kitchen a while, and when he checked, she had taken toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. She felt he was overreacting.\n\nHmm. First, he ordered the pizza because he was starving and wanted that specific place. She agreed to have some of what he got. He assumed she would take a piece or maybe not take any, but instead, she altered the pizza without his knowledge. The key here is that he might have expected her to either take a piece as is or maybe not eat it if she wasn't interested. But she took off toppings from all the pieces, which made him angry because he was expecting to eat the pizza as it was. \n\nShe thought it was fine because he had already taken two pieces and she didn't take all the cheese off. She might not see it as a big deal, but he felt she was being inconsiderate. The question is whether his anger was justified or if he overreacted.\n\nFrom his perspective, he paid for the pizza, wanted to enjoy it as it was, and felt that her actions were selfish and ruined his experience. From her side, she might have thought since he had two slices, it's okay to take toppings from the remaining ones. She didn't ask, which is a problem, but maybe she didn't think about how it would affect him. \n\nBut was he in the wrong for calling her selfish? He did order it for himself, but he did ask her if she wanted something and she said no. However, she didn't specify that she wanted to modify the pizza. So, maybe she didn't think he would mind. But he might have felt that since he paid for it and wanted to eat it as is, her actions without his consent were inconsiderate. \n\nThe argument escalated, and he compared her actions to being selfish, which might have been a valid point. However, maybe he could have handled it differently instead of calling her names. The question is about whether he was in the wrong. \n\nI think the key points are consent and communication. She modified the pizza without asking, which he didn't expect. He might not be in the wrong for being upset. But maybe he overreacted in the way he expressed his anger. However, the core issue is her taking without asking. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the answer might depend on cultural norms or how they usually communicate. \n\nIn some relationships, people share food without issue, but if he paid for it specifically because he wanted it, she might have assumed she could take parts without taking a whole slice. Still, the fact that she did it without asking is a problem. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
