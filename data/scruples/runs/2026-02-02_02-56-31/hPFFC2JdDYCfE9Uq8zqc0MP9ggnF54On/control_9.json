It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation goes like this: the author ordered pizza from a specific place they really wanted, and their girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got. He took two slices first, then when he went to the kitchen, he found that she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument. He's wondering if his reaction was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective: he was craving this specific pizza all day, it's expensive but worth it. He offered the girlfriend some, and she said yes. He then went to watch TV, took his two slices, and assumed she would take toppings from one or two slices. But she removed toppings from all of them, leading to his anger. He feels his reaction was about her selfishness, not just the pizza.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: she said she would have some of the toppings, not a whole piece. She might not have realized that removing toppings from all slices would affect the author's desire to eat the pizza. She was confused by his anger and defended her actions, thinking it's still edible. She might not have considered that the author wanted the pizza as it was, with all toppings intact.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author was really looking forward to the pizza, which was a specific craving. The girlfriend thought she was being considerate by not taking her own slice but just some toppings. However, her action of removing toppings from every piece could be seen as inconsiderate because it altered the pizza the author specifically wanted. The author's frustration is understandable because he wanted to enjoy the pizza the way it was ordered. \n\nBut was the author wrong for starting a fight? The girlfriend didn't ask for the pizza initially, but once he ordered it, she had a right to partake. However, the way she did it might have been inconsiderate. The author's reaction escalated into an argument, bringing up other issues. Maybe he overreacted by calling her selfish and having a big fight, especially since it's just pizza. But the girlfriend's action might have been a miscommunication. She thought she was being helpful by not taking a full slice, but ended up modifying all the slices, which the author didn't expect.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did start the fight by getting angry and using harsh language (\"fucking\"), which contributed to the argument. However, the girlfriend's action was also inconsiderate. The key here might be communication. The author could have asked if she wanted a slice instead of assuming she'd take toppings, and she could have communicated her preference better. Since the author escalated the situation with his words, maybe he's partially at fault. But is he entirely in the wrong? The question is whether he's in the wrong, so I need to see if his anger was undue. The girlfriend's action did alter the food he wanted to eat, so maybe not entirely his fault. But maybe he could have handled it without a fight. \n\nHmm. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. But some might argue that the argument was over a trivial matter and that he overreacted. However, the girlfriend's action of modifying all the slices shows a lack of consideration for his preferences. The author's anger is a response to her behavior, so he's not entirely wrong. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for blowing it out of proportion. But the story says he felt justified because of her selfishness. \n\nI think the main point is whether the girlfriend's actions were selfish and inconsiderate. If she took the toppings from all the slices, that's not just taking a portion but affecting the overall experience. The author wanted to eat the pizza as ordered, and her modification made that less possible. So the author's reaction is based on her not respecting his choice. However, he could have communicated better. Maybe both are at fault, but the question is about the author being in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the expectation is often mutual understanding and communication. The author didn't check if she wanted a slice rather than toppings, and the girlfriend didn't consider that removing toppings would affect his enjoyment. But the author's use of harsh language and escalation to a fight might be the problem. So maybe answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he reacted in an aggressive manner, even if his feelings were hurt. The girlfriend's action was a mistake or miscommunication, but he shouldn't have blown it up. However, the girlfriend's explanation that she took some toppings and was confused about his anger might indicate her lack of awareness. \n\nAlternatively, the author's anger is a result of her not considering his preferences, so he's not in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the action was truly selfish or a miscommunication. If she thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole slice, then the author's reaction is unwarranted. But if removing all toppings is selfish, then he's justified. It's a bit of a gray area, but since she didn't take a slice, maybe she was trying to be considerate. The author's error was not clarifying if she wanted a slice with toppings or just some toppings, and then reacting harshly. So maybe answer A. But I'm a bit conflicted. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, then the fight was justified. If not, then the author is at fault. Since the author ordered the pizza he wanted, and she modified it without considering that he might want it as is, maybe B is correct.\n"
