It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering pizza, eating two slices, and then their girlfriend taking toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author was clear they were starving and ordered the pizza, assuming their girlfriend might want some. She said she'd take some, but then later took toppings from all the slices. The author felt this was inconsiderate, especially since they had already taken two slices. The girlfriend thought it was fine, maybe because she didn't take all the cheese or toppings off. She might have thought it was okay since the author had already eaten some.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Anger over someone taking toppings off all the pizza could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend might have thought she was just using the remaining pizza. The author might feel ownership over the pizza since they ordered it and paid for it, but maybe they should have considered sharing or discussed it beforehand. The girlfriend didn't communicate her intentions, so maybe she's partly at fault too. However, the author's response was to call her selfish and escalate into an argument, which could be seen as starting the conflict. The question is if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and starting the fight. \n\nOn one hand, the author's anger might be justified if they felt their food was being messed with. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the impact of her actions. The key is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Since the author took two slices, the rest was supposed to be shared. The girlfriend took toppings, which could be seen as altering the food the author had already taken. The author's anger might be inconsiderate, but the girlfriend's action was also inconsiderate. However, the author started the argument by calling her selfish. So maybe the author is at fault for reacting that way first. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's action was indeed selfish, the author isn't wrong for getting upset. \n\nI think it's a bit of both, but the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. Since the author escalated the situation by calling the girlfriend selfish and starting the argument, they might be more at fault. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was the trigger for the fight. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
