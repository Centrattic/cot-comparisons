It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for getting angry over their girlfriend messing with their pizza. So, first, the situation: he ordered a specific, more expensive pizza he really wanted. She said she'd take some of whatever he got. He ordered it, ate two pieces, went to watch TV. Meanwhile, she was in the kitchen for a while. When he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings off the pieces. He thought she took from one or two pieces, but she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, she said he was overreacting.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both perspectives. From his side, he ordered the pizza he really wanted, which was a treat. He expected her to take some of the pizza as a whole, maybe a few pieces. Instead, she deconstructed every piece, which might have made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him. He feels she was inconsiderate because the pizza is now ruined for him. His reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which led to an argument.\n\nFrom her perspective, she said she didn't take all the cheese, just some toppings. She might have thought it was okay to take some from each piece without considering how it would affect his enjoyment. She might have felt that since he had already eaten two pieces, it was fine for her to take from the rest. Her confusion and saying he was overreacting could indicate she didn't see the issue.\n\nI need to assess if his reaction was proportionate. Pizza is a shared meal, but he ordered it for himself. However, when he asked her if she wanted something, she said she'd take some, which might imply she expected to have some of the pizza as is. By deconstructing all the pieces, she altered the order he paid for, possibly diminishing the value or enjoyment for him. His anger could stem from feeling that his effort and expense were disrespected. However, getting angry to the point of a big argument might be over the top, especially since it's just food. But if the act of deconstructing every piece made the pizza inedible or less enjoyable, maybe his reaction is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, she might not have realized the extent of what she did. She could have genuinely thought it was a minor thing. His response of calling her selfish might have been too harsh without discussing it first. Communication could have been better on both sides. He might have assumed she was being selfish, but she might have seen it as saving money or just taking what she needed. However, the key point is that he ordered the pizza, paid for it, and she altered it without his consent. That could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it affected his experience. \n\nIn relationships, these sorts of things can lead to arguments because expectations aren't aligned. The user might not be entirely in the wrong because his request was respected in part (she said she'd take some), but she didn't follow through the way he expected. However, his reaction was to call her selfish and escalate the argument, which could be seen as his overreaction. So maybe the answer is that he's partially in the wrong for the way he reacted, but the situation involved mutual misunderstandings. But the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. Given that she altered the food he paid for without his consent, maybe he's not in the wrong for being upset, but the way he handled it was inappropriate. However, the question is a binary choice between A and B. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. Considering all, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because the action of deconstructing all the pizza without consent was inconsiderate, even if the reaction could have been better. But some might argue A because it's just pizza and he overreacted. But given the context, the user's perspective is that he felt disrespected, so B.\n"
