It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two pieces, and when he went to the kitchen, found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The girlfriend was confused and thought it wasn't a big deal.\n\nHmm, from the author's perspective, they might feel that the girlfriend wasn't considerate by taking from all the pieces, making the pizza less enjoyable. But from her side, maybe she didn't think about how he'd feel, assuming he had his own pieces. The problem here is communication. The author didn't check if she wanted to eat, but she said she would have some, which might imply she thought she could take a piece or two. Instead, she took from all the pieces, which the author found frustrating.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did start the fight. He ordered the pizza he wanted, but when she took from all the pieces, he got angry. However, maybe he could have handled it calmly and discussed it instead of calling her names and escalating. On the other hand, she did take from the pizza without considering his feelings, which might be inconsiderate. The question is whether his reaction was justified. Since he called her selfish and they ended up in a big argument, maybe he overreacted, but the initial act of her taking the toppings off every piece was inconsiderate. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's action was selfish, but the author's response was to call her names and start a fight. Maybe the author could have expressed his feelings without attacking her. So, even if he felt wronged, his reaction might be the problem. So, perhaps the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author had the right to express his frustration. But if his reaction was overly harsh, then maybe A. It's tricky. In relationships, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong if the girlfriend was indeed inconsiderate, but his method of handling it could have been better. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong, not about the best way to handle it. The author's anger wasn't unjustified if the girlfriend was being selfish. So, maybe the answer is B.\n"
