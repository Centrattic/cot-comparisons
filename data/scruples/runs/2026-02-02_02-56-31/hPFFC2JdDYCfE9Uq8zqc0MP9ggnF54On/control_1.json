It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked for pizza but didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author thought she meant taking toppings from one or two pieces. But when he checked, she had taken toppings from every piece. \n\nThe author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The question is whether he was wrong. \n\nSo, considering the context: the girlfriend didn't eat any of the pizza he ordered for her, but instead took toppings from all the pieces. The author might feel that his effort to share the pizza was disregarded. However, the girlfriend's actions might have been a way to avoid eating pizza but still use the toppings. \n\nThe author's reaction was anger and name-calling, which escalated the situation. The girlfriend felt it was blown out of proportion. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, getting angry over someone not eating their share and taking toppings isn't entirely unreasonable, but maybe the reaction was excessive. However, the girlfriend's action of modifying all the pizzas could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of starting the fight, the author's anger and accusations might have been the trigger. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was harsh. So, both might have contributed, but the main question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No) because the author's anger, while maybe intense, stems from a perceived inconsiderate act. However, the girlfriend's actions were also questionable. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing in starting the fight, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, in typical AITA scenarios, if both are at fault, but the main trigger was the girlfriend's action, then the author's reaction could be seen as justified. So the answer is B.\n"
