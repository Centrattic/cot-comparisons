It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong to start a fight over pizza. The situation involves a girlfriend who, after the user ordered an expensive pizza they were craving, ended up taking toppings and cheese from every piece in the kitchen. The user got angry, called her selfish, and a big argument ensued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user was hungry, ordered pizza they were excited about, and expected to share with their partner. When the girlfriend took a lot of the toppings, it might have felt like she was spoiling the pizza for them. The user's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which escalated the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. She might have thought taking a little from each piece was better than taking a whole one. The user didn't check if she had already taken some before confronting her, which could have been a miscommunication. Also, the argument brought up past issues, which complicates things.\n\nBut the user's anger over the pizza might be seen as overreacting. However, the girlfriend's actions did alter the pizza the user paid for and was looking forward to eating. The user's frustration could be valid, but the way they handled it\u2014calling her selfish and starting a fight\u2014might have been excessive.\n\nCommunication is key here. The user could have asked if she wanted a piece or if taking toppings was okay first. The girlfriend could have communicated her needs better or asked for a piece. Both might share some responsibility for not discussing it clearly.\n\nThe user's argument that it was selfish is subjective. The girlfriend might have thought it was a small amount. The user's reaction, while perhaps justified in feeling upset, led to a fight that might not have been necessary. So, maybe the user is partially at fault for not handling the situation more calmly. However, the girlfriend's actions also contributed. The answer depends on whether the user's anger was proportional. Since it's their pizza and the girlfriend altered it without asking, the user might not be entirely wrong, but the way they reacted could be seen as over the top. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but with the note that communication could have been better.\n"
