It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that they ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever they get. Then when the pizza arrived, he took two pieces, went to the living room, and she was in the kitchen for a while. When he noticed she wasn\u2019t eating, he asked why, and she said she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The user ordered the pizza for himself but offered to share. The girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece but then took toppings and cheese off all the pieces. The user found that inconsiderate and got angry. The girlfriend thought the user was overreacting.\n\nSo, from the user's perspective, he might feel that since he specifically wanted that pizza and the girlfriend agreed to share, she shouldn't have ruined all the pizzas. But from her side, maybe she felt like she didn't have to eat the whole piece and that modifying the pizza wasn't a big deal. \n\nBut wait, if he ordered the pizza for himself but she's supposed to have some, and she took toppings off all of them, that might affect his ability to eat the pizza as he wanted. So he could be justified in being upset because she altered the food he ordered. However, he might have overreacted by calling her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a bigger argument. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was just customizing the pizza to her taste, not realizing it would bother him. But if she said she didn't want a whole piece, maybe she expected to take a part of each pizza rather than taking from all of them. \n\nThe key points are: the user ordered the pizza, offered to share, she said she'd have some, but then took toppings from all pieces, making them less enjoyable for him. He expressed anger, she was confused and thought he was overreacting. \n\nI think the user isn't entirely wrong because he was specific about the pizza he wanted, and she changed it in a way that affected his experience. But he might have handled it poorly by escalating to a fight. The girlfriend could have asked for a specific part or maybe ordered her own pizza if she wanted different toppings. So maybe both sides have some responsibility here. However, the user's actions in calling her selfish and starting an argument might have been disproportionate. The answer should consider both perspectives but decide if the user is in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend took the toppings from all the pizzas without considering that he wanted them as they were, that's her being inconsiderate. But he might have been too quick to accuse her without understanding her reasoning. The question is whether the user's anger was justified. Since she modified the food he paid for and wanted to eat, maybe he's not wrong to be upset. But the fight part is his fault for not staying calm. So maybe the answer is B (No), but with the note that their communication could have been better. The user isn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe for how he handled it.\n"
