It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, he ordered pizza from his favorite place because he was really craving it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever he got. Then he took two pieces, went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When he checked, she said she didn't want a whole piece, just toppings. He thought she took some toppings off one or two pieces. But when he went to the kitchen, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom his perspective: He was really looking forward to the pizza, which was his favorite and a bit expensive. He assumed she meant taking a few toppings off, not completely altering all the pieces. Feeling his pizza was ruined, he got upset. He might feel that she wasn't considerate in modifying the pizza without discussing it with him, especially since he had already ordered it based on their initial conversation.\n\nFrom her perspective: She said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. She might have thought it was a way to share or get the toppings she wanted without taking a full slice. She might not have realized that removing toppings from all pieces would affect his enjoyment. She could see his reaction as overreacting, especially since she didn't take all the cheese off, so it's still edible.\n\nCommunication seems key here. He ordered the pizza intending to eat it as is, but she changed it without checking with him. However, she might not have realized the extent of what she did. The argument might have been about different expectations and a lack of communication. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, getting angry over ruined pizza could be seen as a big reaction. But considering the effort and cost, maybe it's understandable. On the other hand, she altered the pizza in a way that wasn't discussed, which could be selfish. The argument might have been about different expectations. The user might not be in the wrong entirely, but maybe the fight wasn't necessary. However, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIf the answer is B (No), then it's because he had a valid reason to be upset about the pizza being altered. If A (Yes), then maybe because he overreacted. Given the context, it's a bit of a gray area. The key points are communication and differing expectations. Since she changed the pizza without confirming what she meant by \"some toppings,\" he had a right to be upset. But the argument might have been avoidable with better communication. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer is B because he had a valid point about the pizza being altered, even if the reaction was intense.\n"
