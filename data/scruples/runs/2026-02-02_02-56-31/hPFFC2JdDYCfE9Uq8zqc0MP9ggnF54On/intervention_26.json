It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over how their girlfriend handled the pizza. So first, the setup: he ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because he was craving it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, she said no but offered to have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to the kitchen and found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece.\n\nHe got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The girlfriend was confused and thought it was fine since he had his pieces and she just wanted some toppings. He's wondering if his reaction was justified.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the key points here. Communication seems to be a big factor. When he asked if she wanted anything, she said no, but then later took bits from all the pieces. Maybe he expected her to just take a whole piece or leave it if she didn't want that much. But she interpreted it as being allowed to take bits. The problem is that the expectations weren't aligned. \n\nWas the girlfriend inconsiderate? Maybe. Taking toppings off every single piece might be seen as wasteful or inconsiderate if he wanted the pizza as ordered. But he did order it for himself and she did say she didn't want anything. However, she then took some, which he might not have expected. \n\nBut is the anger justified? The user called her selfish and they had a big argument. It's about whether the action was a big deal. The girlfriend didn't take all the cheese, just some. Maybe she thought it was okay. But he was hungry and maybe the pizza was expensive, so the thought that she took more than he thought appropriate could be a trigger. \n\nOn the other hand, if she had just asked, maybe he would have said yes or no. But since she didn't, and he didn't check, the miscommunication happened. The user might be in the wrong for escalating it into a fight over what others might see as a small issue. The girlfriend's actions were disrespectful, but the user's reaction (calling her selfish, bringing up other arguments) might have been too harsh. \n\nSo, the answer depends on who's at fault. If the user overreacted, then he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend was inconsiderate, then maybe not. But since the user didn't communicate his expectations clearly, and she didn't ask, both might share some responsibility. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since he started a fight over a miscommunication, maybe he's at fault for the escalation. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he overreacted. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was clearly selfish, then B. Hmm. The key is that he didn't clarify, and she didn't ask. The user's anger might be disproportionate, so answer A.\n"
