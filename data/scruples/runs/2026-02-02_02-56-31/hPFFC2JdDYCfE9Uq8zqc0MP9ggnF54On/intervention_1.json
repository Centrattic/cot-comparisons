It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that they ordered a specific pizza because they were craving it. Their girlfriend said she would just have some of whatever he got. When he ate two pieces, she came back and took toppings off all the remaining pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are communication and expectations. He thought she would take some toppings off one or two pieces, but she took from every piece. That's probably the main issue. Did he overreact? Maybe. But it's about how he perceived her actions. She might have thought it was fine, but he felt disrespected or inconsiderate. \n\nBut wait, he ordered the pizza himself, and she agreed to have some. He ate two pieces before she did anything. So maybe she felt she had the right to take from the remaining slices. However, taking toppings off all the pieces might not be the considerate way to do it. If he wanted to keep the pizza as is, he could have asked her not to mess with it. But he didn't. \n\nOn the other hand, she might not have considered that he wanted the toppings intact. But he could have been more clear. The argument escalated because he called her selfish, which she found annoying. Maybe his reaction was harsh, but the act of taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, who is at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. But if he didn't set boundaries and she didn't consider his preferences, maybe both share some responsibility. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Since he was the one who started the argument by being angry and making accusations, maybe he's partially at fault. But if her actions were indeed selfish, maybe not. The answer depends on whether his anger was justified. If she messed with the pizza without considering his enjoyment, then he's not wrong. But if he could have communicated better, then maybe he shares some blame. The question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No) because his anger, while strong, might be justified if he felt disrespected, but maybe not entirely. Wait, but in relationships, communication is key. He ordered the pizza and didn't specify how she should handle it. So perhaps he's not entirely in the wrong, but maybe she's not either. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer is probably B, he's not in the wrong because the situation was a misunderstanding, and her actions were inconsiderate. So he's justified in being upset, even if the argument was overblown. The answer is B.\n"
