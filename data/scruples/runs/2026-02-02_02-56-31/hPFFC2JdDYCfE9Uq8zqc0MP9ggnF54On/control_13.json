She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry over a pizza situation. Let me think through the details.\n\nSo, the author ordered pizza from a specific place they really wanted. They told their girlfriend they were starving and asked if she wanted something. She said no but would have some of whatever he ordered. Then he ordered, ate two pieces, and when he went to the kitchen, he found she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that since she said she would have some of the pizza, she would either take a piece or maybe take toppings from one or two. But she took from all the pieces, leaving them ruined. The girlfriend was confused why he was upset because she didn't take all the cheese. She thought it was still fine to eat. The author felt this was inconsiderate because he had paid for the pizza and expected her to not ruin it for him.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, he ordered the pizza because he really wanted it and had already paid. He asked her if she wanted anything, and she declined but said she would have some. If she agreed to take toppings from a couple pieces, it would have been fine. But she took from all, which left him with an unappetizing meal. He was angry because he felt she was being selfish. However, he didn't clarify her request beforehand. She might have thought leaving a bit of toppings was acceptable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have checked in again before eating his own pieces. If he was worried about her taking too much, maybe he should have specified. But his main point is that she didn't consider his preference for the pizza he paid for. The girlfriend's response that she didn't take all the cheese might be true, but if it left the pizza inedible for him, that's a problem. \n\nSo, the question is whether his anger is justified. The girlfriend didn't communicate her intentions clearly either. She might not have realized the impact of her actions. But the author's reaction was to call her selfish and start a big argument, which escalated things. However, the situation is about conflicting expectations. If he had clarified earlier, maybe the problem could have been avoided. But given that she changed the pizza he paid for without his consent, there might be some validity to his frustration. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: the author didn't confirm her request and assumed she would take only a little. The girlfriend didn't consider how much she took. It's a mutual miscommunication. But since the author was more invested in the pizza and it was his choice to order, his reaction might be seen as justified. On the flip side, escalating to a fight over this might be seen as overreacting. However, if the pizza was ruined and he had valid reasons for being upset, then it's not entirely his fault. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because he ordered the pizza with his craving in mind, she agreed to have some, but her actions ended up ruining it. However, his approach in calling her selfish and blowing it out of proportion might be part of the issue. But since she was inconsiderate in her actions, the author's frustration is understandable. So, maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides. But the key is whether he's in the wrong. If the situation was about his expectations being violated and her not respecting that, then he has a point. So the answer is B.\n"
