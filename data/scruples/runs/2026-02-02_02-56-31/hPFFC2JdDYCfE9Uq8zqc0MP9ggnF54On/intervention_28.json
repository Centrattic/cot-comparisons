It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user ordered pizza because he was really craving it from a specific place, which is more expensive but worth it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of his pizza. He took two pieces and went to watch TV.\n\nThen, when he went to the kitchen for more, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's perspective: he paid for the pizza, was really hungry, maybe expected to have it all or share it. He thought she took some toppings off a couple of pieces, but instead she took a lot from every piece. He feels she was selfish for taking so much that it made the pizza less enjoyable for him.\n\nHis girlfriend's perspective: She didn't order her own pizza, just wanted some of his. She didn't take all the cheese, just some, and maybe thought it was okay. She might have not realized the extent to which he wanted the toppings. She felt he was overreacting and called him a child.\n\nNow, the key points. Did the user have a right to be upset? He paid for the pizza, but he did offer her some. She accepted by saying she would have some of whatever he got. But instead of taking just a bit, she removed toppings from all the pieces. That could be seen as taking more than her share, especially if the user was expecting to have the whole pizza or a reasonable amount.\n\nHowever, he did ask her if she wanted anything, and she said no, then took some. Maybe she didn't think she needed to order her own, so taking some of his pizza was a way to get what she wanted without spending. But the way she did it\u2014removing toppings from every piece\u2014could be inconsiderate because it ruins the pizza for him.\n\nHe called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be valid if she took too much without considering his preferences. On the other hand, he might have been too harsh in his reaction, escalating the situation by name-calling. The argument could have been avoided with clearer communication. Maybe he should have mentioned when he first noticed her in the kitchen, or she could have asked if she could have some without taking all the toppings.\n\nBut since she took so much, the user's anger isn't entirely unfounded. He was hungry, had a craving, and the pizza was important to him. Her actions made it less enjoyable. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her names and escalating to a big argument\u2014might have been unnecessary. But the initial cause (her taking the toppings) could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, these kinds of things can be triggers for arguments. The user's reaction might be proportionate to his feelings about the situation, especially if he values his pizza a lot. However, maybe he could have handled it more calmly. But the question is whether he was in the wrong. If she took too much without considering his needs, then he's not entirely wrong. But if he overreacted, then maybe he shares some blame.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because her actions were inconsiderate, but maybe A if his reaction was too harsh. But the user's anger is about her selfishness, which he might have a point about. However, the way he handled it could be part of the problem. It's a bit of a toss-up, but the question is about whether he was in the wrong. If the main issue is her taking the toppings, then he's not wrong. If the main issue is his reaction, maybe he is. But since the user is asking if he's in the wrong for starting the fight, which he did, maybe he shares some responsibility, but not entirely. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because she did something inconsiderate. The fight started because of her actions, so he's justified in being upset. So the answer is B.\n"
