It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry and starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that they ordered pizza from a specific place, which is a bit expensive but worth it. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen a while, came back not eating, then he found out she took toppings and chunks from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. He's wondering if his reaction was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user was clear he was going to order pizza and offered to get her something. She said she'd have some of his. But then she didn't take a whole piece, just toppings. He thought maybe she took some off a couple of pieces, but she did all of them. That's where the conflict starts. The user felt she was being inconsiderate, taking from all the pieces, maybe leaving him with less or less enjoyable pizza. The girlfriend thought it was fine, since he took two pieces and she just took toppings, not all the cheese. She got defensive and called him childish.\n\nThe user's question is whether he's in the wrong for reacting that way. So, I need to assess if his anger was disproportionate. On one hand, pizza is a minor thing, and maybe they could have communicated better. If he had ordered just for himself, maybe she expected to take some. But he did offer, so maybe she thought it was okay. However, taking toppings from all the pieces might not have been considerate. Maybe he was expecting her to take a whole piece or just some toppings from one or two. But she went overboard, which he found selfish. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response was defensive. She thought it was fine, not taking all the cheese. But from the user's perspective, the act of taking from every piece might be seen as not respecting his order, which he paid for. The user might feel that even though it's just pizza, the principle of being considerate is important. \n\nBut then again, maybe the user should have communicated better. When he went to the kitchen and saw what she did, he might have asked first instead of assuming. The argument escalated because of the lack of communication. The user's reaction was immediate anger and calling her selfish, which might have been a harsh response. Maybe the problem was more about communication and expectations rather than the act being inherently wrong. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If the girlfriend didn't have a prior agreement that she could take from all the pizza, and the user expected her to take a piece or just a little, then maybe she overstepped. But the user's reaction was to call her selfish and start an argument. Maybe he could have discussed it calmly instead of lashing out. So perhaps both sides have some responsibility here. The user's anger might be justified in feeling disrespected, but the way he handled it might not be the best approach. \n\nIn terms of answer A or B, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If the answer is B (Not in the wrong), because the girlfriend did something inconsiderate and he had a right to be upset. But if the answer is A, maybe because he overreacted. It's a bit tricky. The girlfriend might have done something inconsiderate, but the user's method of addressing it was not constructive. However, the user's anger stems from feeling that the action was selfish. So maybe the user isn't entirely in the wrong, but could have handled it better. \n\nSince the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and his reaction was based on that. But the argument about communication is a factor. However, the core issue is whether he was wrong in getting angry. Given that the action was inconsiderate, even if he overreacted, the initial action might not be his fault. So the answer is B.\n"
