It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author ordered pizza they wanted, offered some to their girlfriend, who initially said no but then took toppings from the remaining slices. The girlfriend took a lot, but the author felt it was inconsiderate. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed the girlfriend would take only a little from one or two pieces, but she took from all of them. The girlfriend might not have realized that the author wanted to eat more than two slices, or that taking from all the pieces would be an issue. \n\nThe author called the girlfriend selfish and they argued. The girlfriend was confused and thought the author was overreacting. The author's anger might be justified if they felt their needs weren't considered, but maybe they didn't communicate clearly that they wanted to eat the pizza and not just share toppings. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend took a lot, even if she didn't take all the cheese. It's a question of mutual consideration. The author could have discussed their preference earlier, and the girlfriend might have thought it was a small thing. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might have overreacted, especially since it was one instance. But the girlfriend's actions were perhaps inconsiderate. However, the argument might have been about different expectations rather than right or wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author took two pieces first, maybe they should have considered that their partner would want to take from the remaining. However, the girlfriend's action of taking from every piece shows a lack of consideration for the author's enjoyment. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a grey area. But the author's reaction might be seen as over the top if they didn't communicate their needs clearly. However, the girlfriend's actions do seem selfish. The answer might depend on whose perspective you take more. If the author felt their preferences were disrespected, maybe they're not wrong. But maybe they should have talked first. However, the girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't realize the impact. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, even if the argument was over a small thing. The author's anger is a reaction to a lack of consideration, which isn't entirely unwarranted.\n"
