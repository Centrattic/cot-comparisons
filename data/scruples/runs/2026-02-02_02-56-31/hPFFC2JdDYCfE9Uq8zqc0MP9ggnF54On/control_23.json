It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The key points here are the actions of both the author and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author ordered an expensive pizza he was craving and shared it with his girlfriend. She initially said she didn't want anything but then took toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. The author found this inconsiderate, especially since he had already taken two pieces. The girlfriend was confused about his anger and accused him of overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author's frustration might stem from the fact that the pizza was a specific craving and expensive. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece could be seen as not respecting his purchase or his preferences. However, the girlfriend might argue that she was just trying to eat in her own way and didn't realize it was a big deal. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction led to a significant argument. He called her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. The girlfriend's response of being \"annoying\" and bringing up other issues might suggest that there were underlying tensions. The question is whether his anger was justified.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed his feelings calmly instead of reacting with anger. The girlfriend should have considered that taking toppings off might affect his enjoyment. But the argument started because of his reaction to her actions, so he might share some responsibility for not handling it better. However, her actions might have been the initial provocation. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger over pizza might seem trivial to some, but if the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish, he's not entirely wrong. But his choice to escalate into a fight could be seen as his fault. However, if the girlfriend genuinely didn't consider his feelings, then he's justified. \n\nHmm, but the key point is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views. In many cases, overreacting to something like this could be seen as the person's fault. However, if the other person acted inconsiderately, the anger might be justified. Since the girlfriend didn't take just a few pieces but modified all of them, maybe the author's reaction is reasonable. But arguing about pizza is still a big deal, so maybe he's at fault for not handling it better. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user is asking for A or B. Considering that the author started the fight by getting angry and called her names, even though her actions were inconsiderate, he might be at fault for the escalation. But if her actions were clearly selfish, then he's not wrong. The answer is tricky. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to decide based on the scenario. Since the author's anger led to the argument, but the girlfriend's actions might have been the root cause. However, the author could have communicated better. \n\nIn many similar situations, the person who reacts with anger and starts the argument is considered at fault, even if there's a reason. So maybe the answer is A. But some might say B because the girlfriend was being selfish. It's a tough call. The question is from the AITA (Am I the Asshole) perspective. In those forums, people often consider both sides. If the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, then the author is justified. But if he overreacted, then he's the asshole. The answer would depend on which side the community leans towards. Given that the pizza was expensive and the author had a specific craving, and the girlfriend took toppings off every piece, that's pretty selfish. So maybe B is correct. But the fact that he called her names and escalated might make A correct. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's actions led to the fight. Even if the girlfriend was inconsiderate, the author's response was the trigger. So he's at fault for starting the fight. Therefore, answer A.\n"
