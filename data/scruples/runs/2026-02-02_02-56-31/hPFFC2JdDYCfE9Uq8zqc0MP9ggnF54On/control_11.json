It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author ordered expensive pizza they craved, asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, then went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, then came back without eating. He asked why, and she said she took toppings off some pieces. He found out she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, she said he was acting like a child, and they fought.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They paid for the pizza, craved it, and expected to eat what they ordered. The girlfriend took from the pizza without asking, which felt inconsiderate. They might feel ownership over the food they ordered, especially if it's expensive. The act of removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as ruining what they wanted to eat, leading to frustration.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She agreed to have some of whatever he ordered, maybe expecting to share. She might have thought taking toppings was okay since he had already eaten. She didn't take all the cheese, just some, and maybe she thought it was still edible. Her confusion and defensiveness might stem from not seeing her actions as selfish.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Did he overreact? Maybe. The pizza was shared, and she did take some, but the way he reacted (calling her selfish, escalating to a big argument) could be seen as disproportionate. However, if the pizza was a special, expensive treat he was craving, and she altered it in a way he didn't want, his frustration is understandable. The key points are communication and expectations.\n\nDid the author set clear boundaries? When he ordered, did he specify that the pizza was for him and she could take some? The girlfriend might have assumed she could take from it since he offered. The author might have failed to clarify that he wanted to eat it as is. On the other hand, taking toppings off all pieces without checking could be inconsiderate.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend took from the pizza without confirming, that's a problem. But the author's response\u2014calling her selfish and escalating the argument\u2014might have been harsh. The initial action was a request for her to have something, and she did take some, but maybe not in a way he expected. However, the act of modifying the pizza he paid for might be a valid point of frustration.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's anger is somewhat justified due to the value and personal importance of the pizza. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and blowing things up might be excessive. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author could have handled it more calmly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, then the author isn't entirely wrong to be upset. But if the reaction was too harsh, maybe A is the answer. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend did alter his order without consent. So Answer B.\n"
