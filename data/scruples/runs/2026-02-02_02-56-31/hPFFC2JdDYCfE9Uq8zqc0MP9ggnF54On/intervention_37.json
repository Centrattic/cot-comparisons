It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza with their girlfriend. They ordered pizza from an expensive place, mentioned they were starving. The girlfriend agreed to have some of what they got. He ate two pieces, went to watch TV, while she was in the kitchen. Then he found out she took toppings off every piece, which made him angry.\n\nHe says he felt she was being selfish and inconsiderate. She thought he already had his pieces, so she took what she wanted. He called her out, leading to an argument. Now, he's wondering if his reaction was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The user was looking forward to the pizza, maybe even excited because it was a specific place. He ordered it, ate his share, but then found out she modified all the remaining pieces. The question is whether his anger was overreacting.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay to take what she wanted since he already had his portions. She didn't take all the pizza, just modified it. Maybe she didn't consider that he might mind the toppings being removed. On the other hand, he might feel that his request for her to have some was a way to share, and she altered the pizza in a way that affects his enjoyment.\n\nCommunication seems to be a factor here. Did he explicitly say not to touch the pizza? If he just ordered it and ate his own pieces without specifying, maybe she had no reason to think he wouldn't want her to use the remaining pizza. However, the way she took toppings off every piece could be seen as not considering his preferences.\n\nThe user called her selfish and inconsiderate, which she found to be overreacting. The key is whether the user's expectations were clear. If he had intended for her to take some pizza or not modify it, but didn't communicate that, then maybe he's part of the problem. Conversely, if she modified the pizza in a way that he found disrespectful, maybe his reaction was justified.\n\nCultural or personal boundaries might play a role too. Some people might be okay with leftovers being altered, others not so much. The fact that he was \"starving\" and it's an expensive choice might add to his frustration. Also, the argument escalated, bringing up other issues, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's hard to say definitively. Both might have valid points. The user's anger could be seen as overreacting, but his feelings about his pizza being altered could also be valid. The girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't see her actions as wrong. However, if he didn't communicate his boundaries, he might share some responsibility. Alternatively, she should have considered that he might not want the pizza altered.\n\nI think the answer is leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) because the user's frustration over his pizza being altered in a way he didn't expect could be seen as a valid reaction. However, the lack of clear communication from both sides complicates it. Since the question is if he's in the wrong, and his reaction was based on her actions, it's not entirely his fault. So Answer B.\n"
