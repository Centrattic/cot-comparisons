It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started a fight over pizza is in the wrong. So, first, I need to look at both sides of the situation.\n\nThe author ordered pizza for themselves and offered their girlfriend some. She said she'd have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV, and she was in the kitchen for a while. When he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that since they ordered the pizza and she agreed to come back with some, she took it without considering his preferences. He might be upset that she altered all the pizza, making it less enjoyable for him. The key points here are communication and expectations. Did he specify that he wanted the pizza as is, or did she assume she could modify it? He might not have communicated clearly that he didn't want her to take toppings off. Also, he ordered it for himself, so maybe he should have considered sharing or ordering separate pizzas if they have different preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that since the author took two pieces first, she had the remaining pizza to herself. She might not have realized that modifying all the pizza would affect his experience. Her confusion could stem from her perception that he already had his share, so she wasn't being selfish. However, modifying all the pizza might be seen as inconsiderate because he might not like the pizza without toppings or cheese. The argument here is about mutual consideration and communication breakdown.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author called the girlfriend selfish and started a fight, which escalated into a big argument. Even though the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the author's reaction might be seen as over the top. The pizza is a shared expense, but the author ordered it for themselves. If they had discussed preferences beforehand, maybe the situation could have been avoided. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all the pizza without asking might be the root of the problem. \n\nBut the author's response was to call her a child and blow things out of proportion. That's aggressive and might make the author at fault for escalating the argument. The initial anger might be justified if he expected the pizza to be untouched, but his reaction was harsh. The girlfriend's confusion might indicate she didn't realize the impact, but the author should have considered her preferences as well. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had asked if she wanted a different type of pizza or if she wanted him to order separately, maybe this fight could have been prevented. However, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's handling of the situation by lashing out might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and not managing the situation calmly. Alternatively, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as selfish, but the author's response was equally problematic. It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe the author is in the wrong because he escalated the conflict unnecessarily. Alternatively, the girlfriend is in the wrong for altering the pizza without permission. The answer hinges on whose actions were more inconsiderate. Since the question is about the author being in the wrong, if the author's anger was justified but the way he handled it wasn't, then maybe A is the answer. But if the girlfriend's actions were clearly wrong, then B. Hmm.\n"
