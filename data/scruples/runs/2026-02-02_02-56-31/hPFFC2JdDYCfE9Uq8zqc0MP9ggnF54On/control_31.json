It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza situation. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza they had been craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything and she said no, but would have some of what he gets. Then, he eats two pieces, but when he goes to get more, he finds that she's taken toppings off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nSo, the key points here are about shared resources and expectations. When he ordered the pizza, he probably expected it to be shared as per her initial agreement. However, when she took toppings off all the pieces, it made the pizza less for him, even if she didn't take entire slices. The author felt this was inconsiderate because he had to eat the remaining pieces with less cheese and toppings, which he might not find acceptable. \n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend didn't eat any pizza herself and was modifying the remaining pieces. She might have thought that since he had already taken his share, it was okay for her to adjust the leftovers to her taste. But the problem arises because the pizza was intended to be shared, and altering it in a way that reduces its quality for both could be seen as selfish, especially since she didn't eat any of it herself. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on the idea that he had already taken his share, but the modification affected his ability to enjoy the pizza as he wanted. The girlfriend's confusion and her response that it's \"still fine to eat\" might not consider the author's perspective, especially since he had a specific craving and paid for the pizza. \n\nBut then, is the author wrong for getting angry? Arguable. Pizza is a trivial thing, and the argument escalated. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. The author's anger stems from feeling disrespected, but maybe his response was overly harsh given the circumstances. \n\nBut considering that the girlfriend didn't eat any pizza and modified what was left without consideration for his preferences, the author's reaction might be justified as being upset about his own enjoyment being compromised. However, calling her selfish and inconsiderate might be seen as a harsh reaction, leading to the fight. \n\nSo, the author's fault could be in overreacting, but the girlfriend is also at fault for altering the shared pizza without regard for his preferences. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the scenario is from his perspective and he's asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether his anger was proportionate. \n\nBut the main issue is that the girlfriend took what she wanted without considering his preferences after he had already taken his share. The author's anger is about the selfish act, which he's entitled to feel. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But some might argue that he should have considered that she's just taking what she wants, even if it's not the best way. However, given the context, the author's reaction is about a shared meal and his own enjoyment being affected, so B might be the right answer.\n"
