It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza, took two slices, and the girlfriend ended up taking toppings off all the pieces. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was craving pizza all day, ordered it, and offered the girlfriend some. She said she wanted some of the toppings, but the author thought she meant taking off a few pieces. Instead, she took toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend misunderstood the author's offer. The author thought \"having some of whatever pizza\" meant taking a slice or two, but the girlfriend interpreted it as taking toppings from all pieces. There's a communication gap here.\n\nThe author's frustration is about the girlfriend's actions. However, the girlfriend might not have realized the impact of taking toppings off all pieces. The author's reaction was calling her selfish, which escalated the situation. While the author's feelings are valid, the argument might have been avoided with clearer communication. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was to call her selfish and start a fight. The author might have overreacted, especially since it's just pizza. However, the initial request was specific, and the girlfriend didn't clarify her needs. The author's anger stems from feeling disrespected, but the way it was handled led to a fight. \n\nSo, maybe both parties have some responsibility. The author didn't clarify the offer, and the girlfriend didn't ask for the toppings. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. The author's anger and the name-calling (selfish) could be seen as the catalyst for the fight. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating it. But it's a close call. Alternatively, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's anger is justified, but the way it was handled was poor. \n\nGiven the options, the answer is either A or B. The key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author started the fight by being angry and calling the girlfriend names, then yes. But if the girlfriend was inconsiderate, then no. The problem is the author's reaction. The girlfriend's action was a misunderstanding or inconsiderate, but the author's response was to start a fight. So, maybe the author is in the wrong. But the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's anger led to the fight. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend was the one who took the toppings, but the author's reaction was excessive. Alternatively, the author's reaction was a result of the girlfriend's actions. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The standard answer in AITA threads often depends on perceived intent. If the girlfriend was inconsiderate, the author's anger is justified. But if the author overreacted, then they are in the wrong. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces is inconsiderate, so the author's frustration is valid. However, the argument escalated because of the author's response. But the root cause was the girlfriend's inconsiderate action. \n\nIn AITA contexts, sometimes the person who caused the problem is the one in the wrong. Here, the girlfriend's inconsiderate act led to the argument. The author's anger is a reaction to that. So the author might not be in the wrong, but the problem is whether their reaction was justified. Since the author called the girlfriend selfish and started the fight, maybe they are in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend was the one who acted selfishly, then the author's anger is a response to that. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's reaction was a response to the girlfriend's inconsiderate action. The author might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were the problem, so the author's anger isn't out of proportion. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author overreacted. However, given the girlfriend's actions, the author's frustration is understandable.\n"
