It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry at their girlfriend over her taking toppings off all the pizza pieces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The user ordered pizza, ate two pieces, and left the rest. The girlfriend didn't eat anything initially but later took toppings off every piece. The user got upset because he thought she meant she'd just take some toppings from one or two pieces, not all. \n\nThe user feels she was selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend's defense was that she only took some toppings, not all, and that she didn't take a whole piece. She also mentioned the user had already eaten their pieces, implying he should have left the rest for her to modify.\n\nNow, considering communication. The user asked if she wanted anything, and she said no, she'd have some of what he got. Maybe he assumed she meant she wanted a full slice, but she might have meant she just wanted a few toppings. There's a miscommunication here. The user might have expected her to ask for half a slice or something, but she didn't. \n\nAlso, when he ordered, he didn't specify that he didn't want her to remove toppings from all the pizzas. Maybe he should have communicated that better. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't ask for permission before modifying the remaining pizza. She might have thought it was fine since he had already taken his share. \n\nThe user's anger led to a big argument. While modifying pizza might seem petty, it shows a lack of consideration for each other's preferences. The girlfriend didn't consider that the user might be upset about the toppings being removed from all pieces. The user might have overreacted, but the girlfriend's actions were also inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties could have handled this better. The user might have been in the wrong for not clarifying his expectations, but the girlfriend's actions were also selfish. However, the user's response was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A, the user is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his expectations clearly and perhaps overreacted. But maybe B, because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. It's a bit of a toss-up, but since the user asked for her to have \"some of whatever\" he got, maybe he should have been clearer. Alternatively, she should have asked if she could take toppings. But since she did take toppings without asking and it's affecting all his pizza, she's the one being inconsiderate. Hmm. Maybe the user is not in the wrong because it's about respecting each other's preferences. If she wanted to take toppings, she should have asked. The user's anger is about her modifying his food without asking. So maybe B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
