It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry about their girlfriend taking toppings off all the pizza pieces. They ordered a specific, expensive pizza they wanted, and the girlfriend ended up taking a lot more than just some toppings off a couple of slices.\n\nFirst, communication seems like a key point. The user asked if she wanted anything, and she said she would have some of whatever he got, which he took to mean she wanted a piece or two. But she interpreted it as being able to take what she wanted from all the pieces. There was a misunderstanding here. He might have felt she was taking without considering his desire to have the pizza he ordered. \n\nThen, when she took off toppings from every piece, he got upset. She didn't think she was doing anything wrong because she thought he had already taken his share. But the user felt it was inconsiderate because it's his pizza and she altered it. The argument escalated, and he called her selfish, which she found childish. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he did act out of anger and called her names, which can be harsh. However, his frustration comes from feeling disrespected when his order was modified without his consent. The girlfriend's actions might have been seen as taking without considering his ownership of the pizza. On the other hand, maybe the user could have been more understanding. But given the situation, the user's anger might be justified because it's his pizza and he had specific preferences. The answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because the root of the issue was a lack of clear communication and mutual consideration, not necessarily his anger being unwarranted.\n"
