It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe guy ordered a specific, expensive pizza he was craving. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, took two pieces, and went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings off. But when he checked, she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nSo, the main points here: Did he ask her to take toppings off? No, he just asked if she wanted anything. She assumed she could take toppings from the pizza he ordered. He thought she meant taking a few pieces, not modifying all of them. He felt she was being selfish and inconsiderate. She thought he was overreacting.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From his perspective, he paid for the pizza he craved, expected it to be there when he wanted, and was upset that she altered it without communication. From her perspective, she might have thought it was okay to take what she wanted since he ordered it for her. But she didn't communicate her actions, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIs he wrong for getting angry? Well, pizza is a minor thing, but the argument stems from unmet expectations and lack of communication. He didn't specify that he wanted the pizza to stay intact, and she didn't ask if it was okay to modify it. Both might have contributed to the conflict. However, his reaction might be a bit intense\u2014calling her selfish and inconsiderate over pizza. But the act of modifying all the pieces without consent could be seen as selfish, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, he didn't clarify his expectations, so maybe part of the blame is on him. But the way he reacted might have escalated things. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is about being wrong, it's about responsibility. Since he didn't set the expectation and she overdid it, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But he could have handled it better. However, the initial action (her modifying the pizza) might be the main issue. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
