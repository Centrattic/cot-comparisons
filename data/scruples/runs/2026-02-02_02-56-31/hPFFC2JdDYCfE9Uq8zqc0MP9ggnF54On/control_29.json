It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the pizza story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever they got. Then, when the pizza arrived, he took two pieces, went to watch TV, and the girlfriend was in the kitchen. When he noticed she wasn't eating, he asked, and she said she took toppings off. He thought maybe one or two pieces, but she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's argument is that the girlfriend took a lot of toppings without even taking a piece, which he saw as selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole piece and just taking some toppings. The author felt that by doing that to all the pieces, it ruined the pizza for him, making it less enjoyable. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza to remain intact. When he asked if she wanted something, he might have assumed she would either take a piece or not eat, but not alter the pizza. The girlfriend thought it was okay to take toppings without taking a piece, not realizing how much that would affect the author's experience. \n\nThe author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which led to an argument. But was that justified? Maybe the author didn't communicate his boundaries clearly. If he had said, \"I really wanted this pizza for myself; you can have a piece or not, but I don't want you altering the ones I'm eating,\" then the situation might have been different. However, he didn't, so perhaps there's a lack of clear communication from his side. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't ask for permission to take toppings from all the pieces. Even if she thought she was being considerate, taking all the toppings could be seen as taking without asking, especially if the author had specific preferences. The value of the pizza (being more expensive) might also be a factor in the author's frustration, as it's a splurge they might not do often. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been disproportionate. However, considering that he was the one who ordered the pizza and didn't set clear expectations, he could be at least partially at fault for not communicating. But the main issue is the girlfriend's action. However, in AITA scenarios, the question is often about whether the person's actions were wrong, but here the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. \n\nThe author did start the fight by getting angry and calling her selfish. If his frustration was justified, maybe not entirely his fault. But if he overreacted, then he might be in the wrong. The problem is that the girlfriend altered the pizza without considering how it would affect him, which is inconsiderate. But the author could have handled it better, like talking about it calmly instead of yelling. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author's anger might not be entirely unwarranted, but his approach was confrontational. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the argument was started by the author. In AITA situations, sometimes both are at fault, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author initiated the conflict by getting angry and escalating it, maybe he's in the wrong for how he handled it, even if the girlfriend's actions were wrong. But the main question is whether he is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the fight was about a valid concern, then maybe not. But if his reaction was over the top, then yes. \n\nThe community often looks at whether the person's actions (starting the fight) were justified. Since the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the author's anger is understandable. However, calling someone selfish and escalating to a big argument is a poor way to handle it. But the initial issue is the girlfriend's behavior. So the author isn't in the wrong for the initial anger, but perhaps for how he handled it. However, the question is about whether he is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the fight started because he was justified in being upset, then maybe not. But if he overreacted, then yes. \n\nIn the end, the answer might be B (No) because the author's anger was in response to his partner's inconsiderate act, even if he handled it poorly. The main issue is the girlfriend's actions, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, the way he handled it could be better. But the question is about starting the fight, which he did. But if the fight was over a valid reason, then he's not in the wrong.\n"
