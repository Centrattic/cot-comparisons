It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza with their girlfriend. The situation is that he ordered pizza from a specific place, told her he was getting it, and she said she'd have some. He ate two pieces, then went to the kitchen to get more, only to find she had taken toppings off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user felt that his girlfriend didn't ask for pizza when he offered, and then she took the toppings off all the pieces, which he found selfish. He ordered the pizza, maybe thinking it was his to eat unless she asked. But she didn't ask, so he might have assumed she wasn't interested. But when she came back and took the toppings, maybe he felt she was taking without permission. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend said she only wanted some toppings, not a whole piece. She might have thought it was okay to take some from the remaining pizza. She didn't take all the cheese, so she thought it was fine. She might not have realized that by taking toppings off all pieces, she made it unsuitable for him. Also, he didn't specify that he wanted to eat all the pizza himself, maybe. \n\nThe question is whether his reaction was justified. He called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be a strong reaction, but he could feel that his choice of expensive pizza was being compromised without his consent. However, since she didn't ask for anything when he offered, maybe she assumed it was okay to take what she wanted. \n\nCommunication seems like a key issue here. The user didn't clarify that he wanted the pizza all to himself, and the girlfriend didn't ask for a specific share. Both might have had different expectations. The user's anger might be over a reasonable concern about his meal being altered without his input, but getting into a big argument over it might be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut the girlfriend's actions did affect the user's enjoyment of the pizza. If the toppings were removed, even partially, it could make the pizza less enjoyable for him. So he did have a reason to be upset. However, the way he reacted (calling her selfish and escalating into an argument) might be seen as disproportionate. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it's a bit of a grey area. The user could have communicated his desire to keep the pizza as is, while the girlfriend could have asked for a specific amount. But since the user didn't specify and she took what she wanted, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. On the flip side, maybe he should have considered that she might take some. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his reaction was based on his pizza being altered without agreement. However, the argument could be that he should have been more communicative. But given the context, it's more about differing expectations rather than one person being clearly at fault. So B might be the better choice here.\n"
