It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user ordered expensive pizza and was eager to eat it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, and when he went to get more, found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, communication seems key here. He told her he was ordering pizza and asked if she wanted anything. She said yes, but maybe didn't clarify that she wanted to take toppings off. He might have assumed she would take a piece or part of one, but she did something different. On the other hand, she might not have realized the value he placed on the pizza or the effort he took to order it. \n\nHe was angry because she took from the remaining pizza without his knowledge, which he found selfish. But maybe he could have communicated better about his expectations. Did he check if she wanted to eat with him before leaving the pizza unattended? Also, when he found out, his reaction might have been harsh for a situation that's relatively minor. \n\nHer confusion and his anger led to an argument. He calls her selfish, and she says he's overreacting. It's possible both have a point. He might have overreacted, but her actions were inconsiderate. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe he's not entirely wrong to feel upset, but his response could have been more measured. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the nuance that communication could have been better from both sides.\n"
