It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering expensive pizza, the girlfriend saying she'd eat some of what he gets. He takes two slices, goes to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he checks, she's taken toppings off all the pieces.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions and expectations here. The author ordered the pizza, expecting it to be there when he got back. The girlfriend said she wanted some of what he got, but didn't specify how much. He took two slices, assuming she'd take a piece or maybe some toppings. However, she ended up modifying all the remaining slices by removing toppings and cheese.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza untouched. The girlfriend thought she could take some toppings but didn't realize he'd want the pizza as it was. She might have thought it was okay because he had already taken his pieces. But he saw her actions as selfish and inconsiderate. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. He did start a fight over something that, while frustrating, seems trivial. His anger might be disproportionate. However, he had paid for the pizza, and her actions could be seen as altering something he bought without his consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate her intent to take toppings before she did it. She might not have realized the impact of her actions. The author's reaction was to call her selfish and escalate the argument. Maybe the author could have expressed his frustration calmly instead of calling her names. \n\nBut the main issue is whether his anger was justified. The pizza was his purchase, and she altered it without asking. Even if she thought it was okay, he had a right to be upset. However, the way he reacted (calling her selfish, leading to a big argument) might have been over the top. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether his reaction was proportionate. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was confrontational. Both might have miscommunicated. However, since the question is about the author being in the wrong, if he escalated the situation unnecessarily, then he's at fault. But if his anger was about her altering his purchase, then maybe not. \n\nIn the end, while both might have contributed to the argument, the author's use of harsh language and starting a fight could place him in the wrong. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
