It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were really craving it. The girlfriend said she would have some of whatever he got, so he ordered it. Then, when he took two pieces and went to watch TV, the girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long time. He didn't think much of it and when he went back, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that the girlfriend wanted to eat some of the pizza, maybe by taking toppings from one or two pieces. But she ended up taking from all pieces, which he found inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't specify her needs clearly. She said she would have some of whatever he got, but didn't mention her intention to take toppings off all pieces. The author might have felt that she didn't communicate her needs properly, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, which led to an argument. The question is whether this reaction is justified. The girlfriend might have felt that since the author ordered the pizza as his choice, she had the right to modify it as she saw fit, especially since he already had two pieces. However, the author's frustration could stem from the fact that he paid for the pizza from an expensive place, and she altered it in a way that made it less enjoyable for him. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend didn't specify her needs and the author didn't check with her before ordering, maybe the author has some responsibility. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces without any prior discussion might be inconsiderate. The author's anger could be seen as a reaction to her not respecting his choice of food, which he paid for, especially from a place he likes. \n\nBut on the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since he ordered it for himself, she could modify it without his permission. The main issue here is lack of communication. The author didn't confirm the details of how much pizza she wanted or if she wanted to modify it. The girlfriend didn't clarify her needs when he first asked. Both could have been more communicative. However, the author's reaction was to start a fight, which might be disproportionate if the girlfriend didn't ask for the whole pizza but just modified it. \n\nIn some relationships, sharing food is a common practice, and the girlfriend might not see an issue with modifying it. The author's frustration might be valid if he felt his preferences were disregarded. But the argument escalated because of miscommunication. The author could have discussed the situation calmly instead of calling her names. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not communicating better and reacting angrily. However, the girlfriend's actions might have been disrespectful to his choice. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author could have handled the situation better. However, if the argument was over a minor issue and the author reacted in a way that was out of proportion, then maybe A. But given the details, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend didn't explicitly ask for the pizza, just said she would have some, so her taking toppings from all pieces after he already ate two might be seen as selfish. Therefore, the author's anger is understandable, and he's not in the wrong.\n"
