She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a pizza order and a fight between the author and their girlfriend. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was really craving pizza from a specific place that's a bit expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever they got. So the author ordered the pizza, ate two pieces, and went back to watch TV. While the author was in the living room, the girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. Then she comes back, and the author notices she's not eating. She explains she took toppings and cheese off the pizza, not wanting a whole piece. The author finds out she took from every single piece, which upsets them. They call her selfish, she says they're overreacting, and a big argument ensues.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They paid for the pizza, ordered it specifically because they wanted it, and maybe expected it to be their own. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever they got, so they might have thought she would take a piece or two. Instead, she took toppings and cheese from all the pieces, which left the pizza less enjoyable for the author. The author might feel disrespected or considered selfish because the girlfriend didn't ask first or leave some pizza for them. Also, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as taking without permission, especially since the author had already eaten two pieces. The argument might stem from the author feeling that their choice to order the pizza was a personal treat, and the girlfriend's actions undermined that.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. She might have thought taking a bit from each piece was okay, not realizing it would upset the author. She might have considered it fair since the author had already taken two pieces. She might also feel that the author was being too sensitive, especially since there's still pizza left to eat. The confusion here is that the girlfriend didn't take all the cheese, just some, and maybe she didn't see it as a big deal. Her being defensive when called selfish could be because she didn't intend to be inconsiderate.\n\nNow, considering communication and expectations. The author ordered the pizza for themselves but the girlfriend was part of the initial conversation where she said she'd have some of it. The author might have assumed that \"some\" meant taking a piece or two, not modifying all the pieces. The girlfriend might have had a different understanding. There's a lack of clear communication here. Both might have made assumptions. \n\nWas the author's anger justified? Well, the girlfriend did take from all the pieces without asking, which the author might see as taking without permission. The author had the right to expect that their pizza, which they paid for, would be available as they wanted. The girlfriend's actions made the pizza less enjoyable, which could be a valid reason for being upset. However, the author could have communicated their preferences better. For example, specifying that they wanted the pizza for themselves and not to be modified. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have asked before taking toppings off. She might not have considered that the author would be bothered by it. But the argument escalated into calling each other selfish and acting like a child, which seems harsh for what is essentially a minor issue. The author might have overreacted in terms of the emotional response, even if their initial feelings were valid.\n\nSo, in terms of who is in the wrong: The girlfriend took the pizza without considering the author's preferences, which is inconsiderate. The author also didn't set clear boundaries. However, the author's response (calling the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate) might be disproportionate. Arguing over pizza is understandable, but escalating it into a big fight with name-calling might be the author's fault. However, if the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish and inconsiderate, then the author's reaction could be justified.\n\nBut maybe the bigger issue is the communication. Both parties made assumptions. The author didn't clarify what they wanted, and the girlfriend didn't ask before taking. So maybe both are partially in the wrong. However, the question is specifically about the author. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the author called the girlfriend selfish and started a fight, which led to bringing up other issues, maybe the author should have handled it more calmly. The author's anger might be reasonable, but the way it was expressed could be seen as wrong. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's actions were truly inconsiderate, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's often about perspective. The author might feel they were in the right because the girlfriend didn't respect their order. The girlfriend might feel the author was being too sensitive. Since the author is asking if they're in the wrong, perhaps the answer is that they're not in the wrong, but maybe both could have communicated better. However, the question is a yes/no for the author's wrongness. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIf the girlfriend took without permission, that's her fault. The author's anger might be justified. However, the author could have communicated better. But overall, the main action was the girlfriend's taking the pizza, so the author's reaction might not be entirely wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (no), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
