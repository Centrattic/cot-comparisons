It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza they really wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever they got. Then the author took two pieces, went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while, came back, and didn't eat. The author asked why, and she said she took toppings off. The author assumed maybe she took toppings from a couple of pieces, but found out she had removed toppings and cheese from every single piece. That's when they got angry, called her selfish, and an argument ensued.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication and expectations. The author thought they had agreed she would take some of the pizza, but she ended up modifying all the pieces. The author's frustration is about shared food and the other person altering it without consultation. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she was being considerate by not taking whole pieces and only using some toppings. However, removing toppings and cheese from every piece would make the remaining pizza less enjoyable for the author, who might have wanted the full pizza experience.\n\nWas the author wrong? Well, maybe they could have communicated better. When they ordered the pizza, they could have specified that they wanted the pizza as is, or maybe they should have checked with the girlfriend again after she went to the kitchen. However, the girlfriend did alter the food that was meant to be shared, without discussing it with the author. That could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's anger might be justified because they felt their preference was ignored, leading to the pizza not being as they wanted. But the argument escalated, and maybe the author overreacted by calling her selfish and starting a fight. The question is whether the initial anger is justified. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author did ask if she wanted anything, and she said no. She then proceeded to alter the pizza in a way that affects the author's enjoyment. The author's reaction might be over the top, but their frustration isn't entirely baseless. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently instead of escalating. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't entirely unfounded. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author had a right to be upset about their food being altered without discussion. However, the way they reacted (calling her selfish, leading to a big argument) could be seen as the wrong approach. But the question is if the author is in the wrong for being angry about the situation. It's a bit of a toss-up. Maybe the answer is B, but the initial anger is understandable. Alternatively, maybe A because they started the fight. But the core issue is the girlfriend's actions. I think the answer is B.\n"
