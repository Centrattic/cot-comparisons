It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break it down.\n\nThe situation is that the author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they really wanted. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, ate two pieces, and then went to the kitchen where he found the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author felt that the girlfriend was being inconsiderate by taking from all the pizza pieces, even though he had already eaten some. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought she was just using the pizza they ordered together, and that it was okay since he had already taken his share. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author ordered the pizza because he was craving it from a specific place, which implies it's a personal preference. The girlfriend agreed to have some of what he got, but maybe she didn't realize he had such a strong attachment to it. When she took toppings off all the pieces, she might not have considered that he wanted to eat it as it was. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. The question is whether his anger was justified. On one hand, it's his choice to order the pizza, and he might have expected it to be eaten as is. On the other hand, once it's ordered, it's a shared meal, and the girlfriend might not have realized the extent of his feelings about it. \n\nAnother angle is the communication. The author didn't clarify that he wanted the pizza untouched, so the girlfriend might have assumed it was okay to modify it. The argument might have been preventable if they had discussed preferences beforehand. But the girlfriend's action of taking from all pieces could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author had a specific craving. \n\nThe girlfriend's response of being confused and defensive suggests a possible disconnect in their understanding of each other's expectations. The author's frustration is about the perceived selfishness, but maybe the issue is more about unspoken expectations. \n\nIn terms of whose fault it is, the author might be at fault for not communicating his preferences clearly. However, the girlfriend could be at fault for not respecting the author's choice to order something he wanted specifically. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the author's anger was disproportionate, then he might be in the wrong. However, if he had a valid reason to be upset about the pizza being altered without his consent, then he's not. \n\nI think the key here is the communication breakdown. The author didn't make it clear that he wanted the pizza as it was, and the girlfriend didn't realize the significance of it. But the author's reaction of calling her selfish and escalating to a fight could be seen as overreacting. So maybe the author is partially at fault. However, the girlfriend's action of modifying all the pizza might also be inconsiderate. \n\nGiven that the author ordered the pizza for himself but shared it, and the girlfriend took from all the pieces, the line is blurry. But the author's response seems more extreme. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for overreacting. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author assumed she would take from one or two pieces, but she took from all. That's a key point. So she went beyond what he expected, even though he didn't specify. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the argument was his fault because he didn't communicate clearly. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who escalates the conflict is the one in the wrong. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. The girlfriend might have been inconsiderate, but the author's reaction was the start of the fight. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) for starting the fight, even if the girlfriend's action was an issue. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend's actions were the root cause, then the author is not in the wrong. But in AITA, the question is usually about who started the conflict. The author's anger and the harsh words he used (calling her selfish, leading to an argument) might make him the one at fault for starting the fight. So the answer could be A. But I need to be careful here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. So even if the girlfriend did something inconsiderate, if the author overreacted and started the argument, he might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
