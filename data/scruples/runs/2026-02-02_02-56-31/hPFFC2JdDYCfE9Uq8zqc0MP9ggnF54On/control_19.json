It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza between the author and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author ordered expensive pizza from a specific place because he was craving it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he gets. Then he orders it, takes two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while, comes back, and when he asks why she didn't eat, she says she took toppings and cheese off every piece. The author is upset because he thought she meant taking toppings off one or two pieces, not all. He calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that when the girlfriend said she'd have some toppings, it was just a small amount. But she ended up taking from all the pieces, which he found selfish. His reaction was anger, calling her selfish, and the argument escalated.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have communicated her intention clearly. If she wanted to remove toppings from all pieces, she should have asked first or explained. However, the author's reaction might be over the top. The pizza was expensive and a personal craving. She took from it without discussing it, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author could have checked with her first before ordering, maybe. Wait, he did ask if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. So he ordered, and she later modified the pizza without his knowledge.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The girlfriend's action was unexpected, but was it wrong? She might have thought it's okay since it's shared food. However, modifying someone's meal without consent could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's anger might be justified if he felt his meal was being altered without his input. However, his reaction was calling her selfish and getting into a big argument. Maybe he could have handled it calmly instead of escalating.\n\nBut the girlfriend's action does seem inconsiderate. She took from all the pieces, which is more than just a little. The author had a right to be upset. However, the way he reacted (calling her selfish, leading to a big argument) might have been excessive. The problem arises from both not communicating properly. The author ordered without confirming the details, and she modified it without discussing. But the main issue is the girlfriend's action. The author's anger isn't entirely unwarranted, but his reaction might have been the wrong approach. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend did take from the pizza without consent, the author might not be in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
