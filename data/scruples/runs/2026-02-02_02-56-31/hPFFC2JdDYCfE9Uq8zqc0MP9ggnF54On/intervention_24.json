It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. They ordered pizza from a specific place, asked their girlfriend if she wanted some, she said she'd take some from what he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen a while, came back, and when he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, she said he was overreacting.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are communication and expectations. Did he set clear expectations? He told her he was starving and ordered the pizza. She said she'd have some. But maybe he didn't specify that he wanted to eat the pizza as is. When he grabbed two pieces, he might have assumed the rest was for both of them. But she ended up modifying all the pieces, which messed up his meal. \n\nWait, he ordered the pizza with the intention to share, right? She said she wanted some, so maybe she expected to have her own pieces. But instead of taking her own, she took toppings off every piece. That's the problem. He might have felt that she ruined his pizza without consent. But she thought she was just taking a bit. \n\nIs it his fault for not specifying that he wanted the pizza the way it was? Or is she at fault for altering all the pieces without discussing? Also, she didn't eat any of it initially and then took toppings from all, which might be inconsiderate. But he called her selfish and said she was acting like a child. Maybe his reaction was too harsh, but the situation could have been avoided with better communication. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because she altered his pizza without consent, but there's also some fault in not communicating clearly. But the main issue is her actions. However, if he didn't mention that he wanted the pizza untouched, maybe he's partially at fault. But the main conflict was her taking toppings off all the pieces, which directly affected his meal. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
