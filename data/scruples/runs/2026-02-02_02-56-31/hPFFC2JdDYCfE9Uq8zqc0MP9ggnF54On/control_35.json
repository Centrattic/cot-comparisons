It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered their favorite pizza, which was a bit expensive but worth it. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no, but then later took toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen.\n\nFirst, the author ordered the pizza for themselves, assuming she didn't want anything. He ate two slices and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, which he didn't think much of. When he checked, she had taken toppings off all the pizza pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. She thought his reaction was over the top.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about expectations and communication. The author ordered the pizza for himself since she initially said she didn't want anything. But maybe he should have considered that she might change her mind later, especially if she was in the kitchen for a while. On the other hand, if he had told her it was his favorite and that he didn't want her to alter it, she might have respected that. \n\nBut she did alter all the pizza, which the author found selfish. However, she might have thought she was being considerate by taking toppings off to make it her preferred way. The problem is that he ordered it without considering that she might want to modify it later, while she didn't check with him before changing it. \n\nI think both sides have some responsibility here. The author could have clarified his preferences when ordering, and the girlfriend could have asked if it was okay to modify the pizza. But since the author called her selfish, maybe his reaction was harsh. However, she did take toppings off all the pieces, which is a lot. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. It's a bit of a grey area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be B, because he did order the pizza expecting she didn't want it, but his anger might be excessive. Alternatively, maybe A if he should have checked with her again. Hmm. I think the answer leans towards B because both parties have some fault, but the author's reaction was perhaps not the right approach. But maybe A because he didn't consider her needs when ordering. Wait, the user asks if the author is in the wrong. The author's main point is that he felt justified because she was selfish. The girlfriend thought he was overreacting. Since the author ordered the pizza expecting she didn't want it, but then she modified it without checking, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
