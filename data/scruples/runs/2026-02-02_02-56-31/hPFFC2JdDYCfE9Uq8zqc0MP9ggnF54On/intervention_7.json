It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry and starting a fight over their girlfriend eating the pizza toppings. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the setup: He wanted pizza from a specific place, which is more expensive but worth it. He ordered it, ate two pieces, and the girlfriend had been in the kitchen. When he noticed she wasn't eating, he asked, and she said she took toppings off. He assumed she took some from one or two pieces. But she actually took toppings and cheese off every piece. That's where the conflict arises.\n\nHe got angry, called her selfish, and she accused him of being a child. The question is whether he's in the wrong. So, considering the situation, was his reaction justified?\n\nWell, he paid for the pizza, which he was craving, and she altered it in a way that made it not what he wanted. He might have felt that her action was inconsiderate because he wanted the toppings on his pizza. On the other hand, she might not have realized the extent of what she did or thought it was a minor issue.\n\nBut here's the thing: communication. He ordered the pizza and offered her to have some. She said she didn't want a whole piece but wanted toppings. He assumed she took a little, but she took a lot. Maybe he could have checked with her first if he was that concerned about the toppings. Alternatively, if he had known she was going to do that, he might have ordered two different kinds of pizza.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have thought she was being considerate by not eating the whole pizza and just taking what she wanted. But she went overboard, making the pizza not as he intended. He had the right to be upset because his preferences were ignored, leading to a waste of food and money.\n\nBut is it a big deal? The user admits it's just pizza, but the issue is about respect and consideration. She might have thought it was a small thing, but to him, it showed selfishness. It's a conflict in expectations. Maybe they need to communicate better about such things. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, both might have some responsibility. He could have been clearer about his expectations, and she could have considered that he might care about the toppings. But the user's anger leading to a fight might be overreacting, especially if she didn't realize the full extent of her actions. However, the act of altering the pizza in a way that affects his enjoyment could be seen as selfish. \n\nI think the key is whether his anger was proportionate. Since he paid for the pizza and had a specific craving, his reaction might be justified. But calling her selfish and inconsiderate might have escalated things. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps could have handled it better. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), as his anger might be seen as a valid reaction to her inconsiderate action, even if he could have communicated better.\n"
