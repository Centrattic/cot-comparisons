It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that they ordered a specific, more expensive pizza because they were craving it. Their girlfriend said she'd just have some of whatever they got. The user took two slices, went to watch TV, and when they went to the kitchen later, they found the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The user got angry, called her selfish, and a big argument ensued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's perspective is that they ordered the pizza, expecting to share, but when they found out the girlfriend had taken from every slice, they felt it was selfish. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since the user had already taken two slices, the rest was fair game for her to modify as she liked. She didn't see the issue because she didn't take all the toppings, just some.\n\nNow, communication seems to be a key factor here. The user asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no. The user might have assumed that she was okay with sharing the pizza as is. However, the girlfriend's actions suggest she wanted to customize the pizza for herself, which might not have been clear. The user's anger stems from feeling that their request was ignored and that the girlfriend didn't respect their choice of food. The girlfriend's confusion and defensiveness could be because she didn't realize her actions were causing a problem.\n\nAnother angle is the value of the pizza. It was more expensive, so the user might have been more particular about how it was prepared and consumed. If the user was paying for the pizza, the girlfriend might have felt it was okay to take what she wanted since it was already paid for. However, the user's frustration could be about the modification of the pizza they specifically ordered, which isn't just about the cost but about the personal choice in the meal.\n\nThe user's reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate might have been an overreaction. Arguing about the toppings could be seen as a minor issue, but if the user felt their personal space or preferences were invaded, it's understandable. The key here is whether the girlfriend's actions were a genuine misunderstanding or a deliberate act of selfishness. If she didn't realize that the user wanted to eat the pizza as is, then it's a communication breakdown. If she did know and went ahead anyway, then the user's anger is justified.\n\nHowever, the user also might have been at fault for not clarifying their expectations when ordering. If they had specified that they wanted the pizza untouched, the girlfriend wouldn't have modified it. The user's assumption that the girlfriend would just take some toppings off one or two pieces was incorrect, leading to the conflict. So, both parties might share some responsibility here.\n\nIn terms of general advice, arguments over food can be a symptom of deeper issues in communication. The user's frustration might be about feeling disrespected, while the girlfriend's confusion might stem from not seeing the issue as the user does. It's possible that neither is entirely wrong, but both could have handled the situation better. The user might have overreacted, but the girlfriend's actions could have been considerate if she had discussed her preference to modify the pizza beforehand.\n\nGiven all this, the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance. However, since the user called the girlfriend selfish and the argument escalated, it's possible that the user's reaction was more intense than necessary. But considering the context of the specific pizza and the modification of all pieces, the user's anger isn't entirely unwarranted. So, the answer might still be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication could have been improved on both sides.\n"
