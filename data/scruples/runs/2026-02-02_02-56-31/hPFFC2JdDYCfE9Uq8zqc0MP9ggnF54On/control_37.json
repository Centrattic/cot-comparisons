It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered a pizza and his girlfriend ended up taking toppings and cheese off every piece. They had an argument about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was craving pizza from a specific place, which was a bit expensive. He ordered it and offered her some, which she accepted. She ended up modifying all the pizza pieces, which he found selfish. She didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The author ordered the pizza, paid for it, and got exactly what he wanted. The girlfriend, instead of just taking a slice or even modifying one or two, took toppings off all the pieces. The author felt this was inconsiderate because he wanted to eat the pizza as ordered. The girlfriend didn't think it was a big deal, leading to an argument.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that his choice of pizza was compromised. Since he paid for it and ordered it specifically because he wanted it that way, her actions affected his enjoyment. The fact that she took toppings off all pieces, not just one, might be seen as going beyond just taking a small portion. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that since she didn't take the entire pizza, she's just adjusting it to her preference. She might see it as reasonable to share the pizza as she likes, especially if she's eating a small part. However, the author's frustration is also valid because he paid for the pizza and had specific preferences.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for getting angry? Well, the argument was about perceived selfishness. If she hadn't communicated her intention to take toppings off, and he had a different expectation, then it's a misunderstanding. However, the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nBut considering that the pizza was ordered for both of them, and she modified all the pieces, which directly affected his ability to eat it as intended, his reaction could be seen as reasonable. The key here is whether her actions were respectful of his request. If he ordered it with the expectation that they would share it as is, her altering all the pieces without discussion was inconsiderate. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered that she has different preferences and communicated better. However, since she didn't mention modifying the toppings until after she did it, the author's anger might be justified. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction stems from feeling that his request was ignored, and the girlfriend's actions were selfish. While the situation is trivial, the author's perspective is valid in wanting the pizza as ordered. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
