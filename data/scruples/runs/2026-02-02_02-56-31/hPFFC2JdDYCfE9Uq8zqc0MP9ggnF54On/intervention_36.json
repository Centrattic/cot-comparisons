It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry about their girlfriend taking toppings off every pizza piece they ordered. They ordered a specific, expensive pizza they were craving. The girlfriend said she wanted some but ended up taking toppings and cheese from all the slices. The user got upset, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The pizza was a specific craving, and they paid extra for it. The girlfriend initially agreed to have some of the pizza. The user thought she'd take toppings off a couple of pieces, but she did it to all. The user felt it was selfish because they were left with less than they wanted. The girlfriend was confused and said it's still edible.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, emotions can run high over things that seem trivial to others. The user's anger might be justified if they felt disrespected or that their needs were ignored. The girlfriend didn't communicate her actions, which could lead to misunderstanding. However, the user's response (calling her selfish and inconsiderate) escalated the argument. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as inconsiderate too, but maybe she didn't realize how much it mattered. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The user might not be entirely in the wrong, but their reaction's intensity could be seen as overreacting. However, considering the effort and expense, maybe it's a two-way issue. Still, the user's right to feel upset isn't entirely invalid. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides to improve communication.\n"
