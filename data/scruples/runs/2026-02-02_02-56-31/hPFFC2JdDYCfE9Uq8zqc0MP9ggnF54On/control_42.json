It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out their girlfriend had taken toppings off every single piece in the kitchen. They got angry, called her selfish, and the argument escalated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then, when he ordered, she ended up taking toppings off all the pieces. The author felt it was inconsiderate because she took from all the pizza, not just one or two pieces. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she was just taking a little off each piece, maybe intending to make it last longer or have some left for later.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, the girlfriend didn't explicitly ask for the pizza, she said she'd have some of what he got. Then she took toppings off all the pieces, which the author found selfish. The key here is that the author might have expected her to take one or two pieces rather than modifying all the pizza. However, the girlfriend might have thought that since she was sharing, she could take from the remaining pieces. \n\nBut the problem is that the author was left with pizza that he didn't want to eat because it was missing toppings. The girlfriend didn't ask for permission, and the author didn't mention not doing that. However, the author's initial request was about taking the toppings off, not about sharing. So maybe the author didn't set clear boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all the pizza without discussing it could be seen as inconsiderate. If she wanted some toppings, maybe she should have asked for a piece or two. The author's anger might stem from feeling disrespected because his pizza was altered without his consent. But the argument escalated, so both parties might have contributed. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author could have communicated his preference for not having the toppings taken off, but the girlfriend's action was unexpected and might have been a breach of understanding. However, since the author called her selfish and the argument turned into a bigger fight, maybe he overreacted. But given that she didn't take a piece but rather altered all the pizza, his reaction might be justified. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate without communication. But maybe there's a middle ground where both could have handled it better. However, based on the details given, the author's anger is a reaction to an action that wasn't discussed beforehand. So the answer is B.\n"
