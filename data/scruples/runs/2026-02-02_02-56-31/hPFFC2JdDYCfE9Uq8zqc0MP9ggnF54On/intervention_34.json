It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry after their girlfriend altered all the pizza pieces. \n\nFirst, the situation: He ordered a specific, more expensive pizza he was craving. She said she wanted some of whatever he got but didn't specify. He ordered it, ate two slices, then went to the kitchen later and found she had removed toppings from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nSo, from his perspective, he was excited about his pizza, and she took what he considers an inconsiderate action by modifying all the slices. He might feel that since he was the one who ordered it, she should have respected his choice or communicated better. He also might feel that by not eating a whole piece, she didn't need to alter all the slices. \n\nOn her side, she might have thought since he ordered pizza for both of them, it was okay to have some toppings off. She didn't take all the cheese, so maybe she saw it as a minor adjustment. When he reacted strongly, she got defensive, leading to the argument.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Did he overreact? He did say she was selfish and inconsiderate, which are strong words. Maybe he should have considered that she thought she was sharing, and he could have communicated better about his preferences before ordering. However, he was clear he was ordering for both, but she didn't specify if she wanted any. So, maybe she assumed she could adjust the pizza as she wanted. \n\nBut then again, altering every single piece might be excessive. He might have expected her to take a slice or two, not modify all of them. There's a communication breakdown here. He didn't ask if she wanted a specific type, and she didn't clarify. The argument might have been avoidable if they had talked more before ordering or she had communicated her preference for toppings before she altered the pizza.\n\nBut since he called her selfish and the argument escalated, maybe he's in the wrong for reacting so strongly. However, her actions could be seen as selfish too. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether his reaction was proportional. Since it's just pizza and they ended up in a big argument, maybe he overreacted. But if he felt disrespected, maybe not entirely his fault.\n\nHmm. I think it's a mix. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A or B. The user might not be entirely wrong, but there are points where both sides could have handled it better. However, the initial question is about his anger being justified. Since the argument escalated to calling her selfish and she felt he was being a child, maybe he did overreact. But given her actions, maybe not. It's tricky. \n\nIn some cases, people might side with the girlfriend because she tried to share and he didn't specify his preferences. But others might think he's justified in being upset because his pizza was altered without his consent. So the answer could go either way. But in AITA situations, usually, if communication was lacking on both sides, the answer is sometimes B, not in the wrong. However, if one person's reaction is disproportionate, it might be A. \n\nGiven that the user called her selfish and inconsiderate, which are harsh words, maybe he's in the wrong for that. Also, maybe he should have considered that she wanted to share in her own way. So leaning towards A. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since her actions were inconsiderate, he's not in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I think the answer here is B (Not in the wrong) because both parties made mistakes, but his anger was a reaction to her actions. It's not entirely his fault. So I'll go with B.\n"
