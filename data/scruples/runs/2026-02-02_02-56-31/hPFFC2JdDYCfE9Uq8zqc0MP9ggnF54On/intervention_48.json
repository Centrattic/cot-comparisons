It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step. \n\nThe user ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it and were starving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she would just have some of whatever he got. So he orders it, eats two pieces, and then when he goes to the kitchen later, he finds that the girlfriend took toppings and cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish and inconsiderate, and they argue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The pizza was ordered by him because he was craving it and he offered it to her. She agreed to eat some of it, but when he went to get more, she had taken toppings off all the pieces. The user is upset because he felt this was selfish. \n\nNow, from the girlfriend's perspective, maybe she thought since he had already taken his two pieces, the rest was fair game. She might not have realized that by removing toppings, she was ruining the rest of the pizza for him. But the user's reaction was anger and calling her selfish. \n\nIs this a reasonable reaction? Well, pizza is a shared meal in many relationships, so if someone orders it and expects to share, taking away the toppings from all the pieces could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the girlfriend might have thought that since he had his share, the rest wasn't his anymore. \n\nAlso, the user didn't check if the pizza was still there when he first brought it in. He just ate two pieces and went back to the living room. Maybe he should have considered that if she wanted to eat some, she might need to take a piece instead of altering all of them. \n\nBut the key point is the act of taking toppings off all the pizza. That's not just taking a piece; it's modifying the remaining pizza in a way that affects the rest. The girlfriend's action was not just taking what she wanted but altering the shared meal in a way that left it less enjoyable for the person who ordered it. \n\nThe user's anger might be overreacting, but the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. The user has a right to be upset if he felt his meal was ruined. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her selfish and escalating into an argument\u2014might be where he's in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend should have communicated better. If she wanted to eat the pizza but didn't want the toppings, maybe she should have taken a piece and removed the toppings from that, rather than all of them. \n\nSo, the question is whether the user's anger was justified. The answer likely depends on how inconsiderate the girlfriend's action was. If she destroyed the rest of the pizza for him, then her action was wrong, and his anger is justified. But if he overreacted, then maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nBut the user's main point is that he felt wronged because she altered the pizza in a way that wasn't communicated. The girlfriend's confusion and her argument that he had his pieces suggests she didn't consider his feelings. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user didn't check if she had taken any, and she didn't communicate her actions. Both might have some fault, but the user's anger leading to a big argument might be over the top. However, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. \n\nI think the main issue is that the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, so the user's anger is somewhat justified, but his reaction (calling her selfish and escalating the argument) might be where he's in the wrong. So the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because while her action was inconsiderate, his response might have been too harsh and led to an unnecessary argument. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's action was clearly selfish, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut in the scenario, the user ordered the pizza for himself and offered it to her. She accepted, but then modified all the pizza. That's a breach of unspoken agreement. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong because her action was inconsiderate. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut the user's response was to escalate into a big argument, bringing up other issues. That might be his fault. So maybe he's in the wrong for overreacting. \n\nHmm. The question is whether he is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's action was wrong, then he's in the right to be upset. But if he overreacted, he's in the wrong. \n\nThe key is that she took toppings off all the pizza, which was not a shared action. So he has a right to be upset. Therefore, the answer is B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
