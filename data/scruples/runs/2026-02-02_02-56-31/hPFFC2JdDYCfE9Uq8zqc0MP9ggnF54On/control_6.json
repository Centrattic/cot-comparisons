It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The user ordered a specific, expensive pizza they were craving. They offered the girlfriend some, and she said she'd have some of whatever they get. Then when the pizza arrives, he takes two pieces, goes to the living room. She's in the kitchen for a while, and when he goes back, he finds she's taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nHmm. First, let's think about the context. The user was really looking forward to this pizza, which is more expensive but worth it. He offered her something, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he gets. He assumes she takes toppings off one or two pieces, but she did it to all. So the main issue is the girlfriend taking apart the pizza in a way he didn't expect, and him getting upset about it.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, he might feel that she didn't communicate her needs properly. He offered her to have some, and she said yes, but then took it to an extreme. He might also feel that she's being inconsiderate because he wanted to eat the pizza as it was, and her actions made it harder for him to enjoy it. Maybe he was hungry and wanted to eat quickly without dealing with this.\n\nBut from the girlfriend's side, she might have thought that since he had already taken his pieces, she could take the toppings off the remaining ones. She didn't eat the whole pizza, just took off some toppings. She might not see the issue because she didn't take all the cheese, and the pizza is still edible. She could also feel that he's being too dramatic, hence the argument about blowing things out of proportion.\n\nSo the question is whether the user's reaction is justified. The user's anger is about the \"display of selfishness,\" implying that he saw her action as taking without considering his preferences. But she didn't take the entire pizza, just modified it. However, modifying every piece might be excessive and disrespectful, especially if he wanted it a certain way. On the other hand, maybe she had a reason for doing it, like a dietary preference or just enjoying the toppings more. The key here is communication and mutual respect.\n\nIf the user had asked her to take toppings off only a few pieces, maybe she would have done that. But he didn't specify, and she assumed she could take from all. Yet, she did say she wanted some of the toppings, not that she needed to take them all. The user's reaction of anger and calling her names could be seen as overreacting, especially since it's just a pizza. But if she did it without asking and modified every piece, that could be seen as inconsiderate too. \n\nThe user might be in the wrong for not clarifying his expectations when he ordered the pizza and for reacting with anger and name-calling. However, the girlfriend's action of altering every piece without consent might also be inconsiderate. The argument seems to stem from a lack of communication. But the user's response escalated the situation. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he started the fight over something that, while frustrating, isn't a major issue. But it's also possible that both have some responsibility. However, the question is specifically about the author. Since the girlfriend's actions were a bit selfish but the user's reaction was harsh, perhaps the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he escalated the conflict with anger and called her names instead of discussing it calmly. But I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish and the user had a right to be upset, maybe the answer is B. But since the user didn't specify anything and ordered the pizza for himself (and maybe others?), but the girlfriend took from all pieces without asking. The user's reaction might be justified if he felt his preferences were disregarded. However, using aggressive language and starting an argument could be inconsiderate. The answer depends on which side is more at fault. Given that the user called her selfish and inconsiderate, and the girlfriend just wanted some toppings, maybe the user's response was the bigger issue. So Answer A.\n"
