It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering expensive pizza, eating two slices, and then finding out their girlfriend took toppings and cheese from every piece. They argue, and the author feels justified in getting angry, while the girlfriend thinks it's a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was clear they ordered pizza for both and asked if she wanted something. She said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then, when he went to eat, she took a lot of toppings off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a fight. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective might be that she didn't want a whole piece, so she took just toppings. But the author thought she meant taking a little, not all the toppings off every piece. Maybe there was a miscommunication. The author might feel that she didn't respect his purchase, especially since it was expensive. On the other hand, the girlfriend might think it's not a big deal and that he overreacted. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did start the fight by getting angry. However, his reaction might stem from feeling disrespected or that his girlfriend was inconsiderate. The key points are communication and expectations. If she took more than she intended without considering his feelings, the author has a point. But if she misunderstood and he overreacted, then maybe he's at fault. \n\nBut the author did mention that the girlfriend was confused and didn't see it as a big deal. So maybe he escalated the situation unnecessarily. However, the act of taking toppings off every piece without asking could be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether getting angry about that is justified. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have talked to her calmly instead of getting angry. But the girlfriend's action might have been disrespectful. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger might be justified, but the way he handled it (calling her selfish and starting a fight) could be wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on how to handle such situations. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might be too harsh. However, the main issue is whether his anger was justified. Since he felt disrespected, and she didn't consider his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, he could have communicated better. But given the situation, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
