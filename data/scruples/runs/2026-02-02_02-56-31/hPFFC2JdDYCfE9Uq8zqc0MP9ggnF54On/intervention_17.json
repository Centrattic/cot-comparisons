It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were wrong for getting angry and starting a fight over their girlfriend taking toppings off all the pizza pieces. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The user ordered expensive pizza they were craving, gave their girlfriend the option to get something, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then he took two pieces, left them in the living room, went back to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while. When he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. \n\nSo, the user feels justified because he had already eaten two pieces and didn't expect her to take toppings off all the pizza. The girlfriend thought she was being helpful, maybe trying to adjust the pizza to her preferences without considering that the user wanted the full pizza. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, maybe. He did mention that he ordered the pizza for himself, but invited her to share. However, when she took toppings off all pieces, it affected his ability to enjoy the pizza as he wanted. But maybe he didn't communicate his expectations clearly. He might have assumed she would only take toppings from a couple of pieces, but she did all of them. Also, he called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be harsh if she didn't realize the impact. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't ask for his permission, which could be an issue. But since he had already eaten two pieces, maybe he should have been more understanding. However, the way he reacted might have been over the top. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. Maybe they both share some responsibility. But since the user is asking specifically if he's in the wrong, I need to decide. The answer hinges on communication and expectations. If he didn't clarify that he wanted the pizza as is, then maybe he's at fault for not setting boundaries. Alternatively, if she should have considered that the pizza was ordered for both of them, she might be at fault. \n\nHmm. But the user ordered it because he was starving and was looking forward to it. She should have respected his preference. But maybe she didn't think it through. However, the user's reaction was to call her selfish and start a fight, which might be too harsh. \n\nI think the answer is B\u2014he's not in the wrong. Because she took actions that affected his enjoyment without his consent, and he had a right to be upset. It's about respecting each other's preferences. But maybe the answer is A because he could have communicated better. Wait, the key point is that he didn't specify that he wanted the pizza untouched, so she might have acted in good faith. But he ordered it for himself, so he might have a right to eat it as he wants. \n\nI think the answer is B. He's not in the wrong because she altered the pizza without his consent, which is inconsiderate. His anger is a reaction to her inconsiderate action. However, the way he expressed it (calling her selfish) might be harsh, but the underlying issue is her action. So overall, he's not in the wrong.\n"
