It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza with their girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user was really craving pizza from a specific, more expensive place. They ordered it for themselves and asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything. She said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ate two pieces, went back to watch TV, and when he noticed she wasn't eating, he asked why. She said she just wanted some toppings off the pizza. He assumed she took toppings off one or two pieces, but found out she removed toppings and cheese from every single piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nSo, the user is wondering if their anger was justified. The key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend said she'd have some of his pizza, but the user expected her to take a piece or maybe a few toppings. Instead, the girlfriend took the entire toppings off every piece, which the user found inconsiderate. The girlfriend was confused about the anger, thinking it wasn't a big deal.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, ordering pizza was a shared expense, and his girlfriend's actions left the pizza inedible for him. He felt she didn't consider his feelings or the financial aspect. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being thrifty or wanted to eat the toppings without the crust, not realizing how much she altered the pizza. The user's anger led to a fight, which he now questions.\n\nI need to assess if his reaction was proportional. While it's just pizza, the girlfriend's action rendered the remaining pizza almost useless, which could be seen as selfish in a shared situation. However, the user didn't clarify his expectations beforehand. He assumed she would take a piece or some toppings, but she did something different. The argument came from a lack of communication rather than an inherent wrong. Both sides might have miscommunication. The user's anger was about the action affecting his enjoyment, but the girlfriend didn't anticipate that. So, maybe both have some responsibility, but the user's reaction might be a bit over the top given it's just a misunderstanding. However, considering the girlfriend's actions, the user's anger isn't entirely unfounded. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication could have been better.\n"
