It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that they ordered pizza from an expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but would have some of what he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, and then when he checked the kitchen, she had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. He thought she would take a piece or maybe some toppings off one or two pieces, but she removed toppings from all the pieces. That's a problem because he wanted the pizza as it was, and she altered it in a way that affected the remaining food. But was he in the wrong?\n\nFirst, he did ask her if she wanted anything, and she said no. So maybe he expected her to not touch the pizza, but if she wanted to take some, maybe he should have specified. But he ordered it for himself, right? He was starving and ordered it. She said she'd have some of whatever he got, so maybe she expected to have some. But then she took toppings off all the pieces, which might have made the pizza not edible for him anymore. \n\nWait, he said she took toppings and chunks of cheese off every piece. So now the pizza is ruined. He was upset because his pizza was altered without his consent. She thought it was fine because she just took a little off each. But if all the pieces are affected, that's a big deal. \n\nShe might have not considered that he wanted the pizza as ordered, and her actions made it inedible. But was the fight justified? He got angry and called her selfish. Maybe he overreacted, but her action was inconsiderate. However, the argument escalated. \n\nI think the user's anger is a reaction to her not respecting his food. But maybe he should have communicated better. If he wanted the pizza untouched, he should have said, \"Don't touch the pizza, it's for me.\" But he thought she would take a piece or some toppings. She took more than that. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a communication issue. He might not be in the wrong for being upset because his food was altered, but he could have handled it better. On the other hand, she might not have meant to be selfish, but her action was inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not entirely. The answer is B \u2013 No, he's not in the wrong. The situation is a misunderstanding in communication. He was clear he was ordering, she thought she could take some, but overdid it. He's upset, which is understandable. But the fight might have been a result of both parties not communicating better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he was the one who ordered and she altered the food without consent, he's not entirely wrong. So B.\n"
