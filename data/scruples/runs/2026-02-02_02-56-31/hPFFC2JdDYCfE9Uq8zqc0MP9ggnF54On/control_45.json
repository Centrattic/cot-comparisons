It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza, told his girlfriend, and she said she'd have some. Then he ate two pieces, went to the living room, and later found out she took toppings and cheese off all the pieces in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza because he was craving it, and he did offer her some. She initially said she'd have some, but then later took bits from all the pieces. The author feels it's selfish and inconsiderate, while she thought she was just taking a little. The key points here are communication and expectations. Did the author make his expectations clear? When he ordered the pizza, did he specify that it was for both of them, or was it implied? He said he asked her if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. So maybe he assumed she would take a piece or two. However, when she took toppings from all the pieces, that might have been unexpected. The author got angry because now he can't eat the pizza as he wanted. The girlfriend's side is that she didn't take all the cheese, just some, and she thought it was fine. She also felt the author was overreacting.\n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, arguments over such things can often be about more than just the immediate issue. The author is frustrated that his girlfriend didn't take a piece but instead modified all the pizza, maybe out of habit or a different way of sharing. The girlfriend might have been trying to be considerate by not taking a whole piece, but in doing so, ruined the pizza. The question is whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. The author calls her selfish, which is a strong accusation. However, the girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, maybe she didn't realize the author was eating the pizza immediately. Or maybe she thought she could adjust the pizza for her own preferences. The problem arises when their actions affect each other's expectations. The author might have felt that by ordering the pizza for both, the pizza was meant to be shared, and modifying all of it without communication was inconsiderate. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended to deprive him, just to take a little. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's anger was justified. Since the girlfriend didn't take a piece but took bits from all, maybe she didn't think it was a big deal. The author's frustration is about the result\u2014he can't eat the pizza as he wanted. The girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't see it as a big issue. So, the author might be in the right in feeling upset, but maybe the way he expressed it (calling her selfish, starting an argument) was the problem. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. In many relationship discussions, if someone feels wronged and their partner doesn't see it, the person who feels wronged isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. But if the action itself wasn't actually harmful, maybe the author overreacted. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions affected his enjoyment of the pizza, but the way he reacted could be seen as harsh. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight, maybe the answer is B (No), because his reaction, while perhaps intense, was a response to his partner's inconsiderate action. Alternatively, if the action wasn't that bad, then the author is in the wrong. It's a bit of a grey area. In typical AITA scenarios, if the person's actions caused a problem even if small, they might not be the AITA. So if the girlfriend's taking toppings off all the pizza was inconsiderate, then the author isn't in the wrong. If it's not that big a deal, then maybe he is. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and relationship expectations. In this case, since the author was specific about wanting the pizza and the girlfriend altered it without considering his needs, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
