It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific place they wanted, which is a bit pricier but worth it. They offered their girlfriend a share, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. So the author ordered, ate two pieces, and then after some time, went to the kitchen and found that the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author feels that the girlfriend was inconsiderate by taking off toppings from all the pieces, which the author might have wanted to eat. The girlfriend, on the other hand, said she didn't want a whole piece and just took some toppings. The author thought that meant a couple of pieces, but she did it to all. The author's reaction was to call her selfish and childish, leading to an argument.\n\nIs the author wrong for getting angry? Well, maybe the girlfriend misunderstood the author's initial offer. She said she would have some of whatever they got, but perhaps she didn't expect to have to split a single pizza with toppings. The author ordered their own pizza, so maybe the girlfriend didn't realize that taking toppings off all pieces would affect the author's enjoyment. However, the author's reaction might have been over the top. The girlfriend didn't take all the food, just some toppings and cheese, and said it's still fine to eat. The argument escalated quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was clear about their craving and the expense, so they might feel ownership over the pizza. The girlfriend's action of modifying all the pieces could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author's response was to call her selfish and blow it out of proportion, which might have been the wrong approach. Maybe they should have communicated better instead of getting angry.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have felt that the girlfriend didn't respect their choice, but reacting with anger and calling her names could have been unnecessary. The girlfriend's confusion might stem from not realizing the impact of her actions. However, the author's initial request was specific, and the modification affected the pizza they paid for. There's a middle ground here, but it's unclear if either is entirely in the wrong. The key issue is whether the author's reaction was proportional. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was confrontational. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, maybe the author isn't wrong to feel upset. But the way they handled it might be the issue. The answer might be B (No), because the author's anger is understandable given the situation, but the reaction was inappropriate. However, the options are A or B. Given the context, the author's anger is not entirely out of proportion. The girlfriend modified the pizza the author paid for, which could be seen as selfish. So the answer might be B.\n"
