It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out their girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the remaining pieces. They got angry, called her selfish, and fought. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza, but the girlfriend said she didn't want anything. Then she ended up taking parts from all the remaining slices. The author felt it was selfish because she didn't take just one piece's toppings but all the pieces. The girlfriend might have thought she was just using what was left without considering the author's feelings.\n\nThe author's anger might be over a minor thing, but they might feel their needs were disregarded. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't communicate her intention to take toppings from the remaining pizza. She might not have realized how the author would feel about it. The author's reaction could be seen as a bit of an overreaction, but maybe not entirely wrong because the girlfriend did take from all the pieces without asking. \n\nAlso, the context of the girlfriend initially saying she didn't want anything but then taking the toppings might contribute to the misunderstanding. The author could have checked if she wanted some pizza initially, but once the order arrived, her actions were not communicated. The girlfriend's confusion and the author's anger leading to a big argument might mean both have some responsibility. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend took from the remaining pizza without consent, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, if the author overreacted by calling her selfish and inconsiderate, that could be their fault. The line between being considerate and overreacting is thin here. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have asked before eating to check if she wanted some, and the girlfriend could have communicated her intention. But since the girlfriend took from all pieces without asking, maybe the author's anger is justified. However, escalating it into a big fight might be their fault. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were selfish without communication, but the author's reaction might be seen as over the top. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is not wrong, then B. If the author is wrong for overreacting, then A. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nLooking at similar situations, people often argue about shared items without communication. If the pizza was ordered for both, the girlfriend taking from it without asking could be inconsiderate. The author might have a point, but the way they reacted (calling her selfish, starting a fight) could be wrong. The problem is whether the anger was justified. The story says it's just pizza, but the author feels justified. \n\nIn the end, maybe the answer is B, because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author's anger is not entirely wrong. But if the author overreacted, then A. Since the girlfriend was confused and the author called her names, maybe A is more correct. Hmm. I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they escalated a minor issue into a big fight without considering if communication could resolve it. But the girlfriend's actions were also inconsiderate. However, the user is asking if the author is wrong. Since the author used harsh words and started a fight, maybe they're at fault. So answer A.\n"
