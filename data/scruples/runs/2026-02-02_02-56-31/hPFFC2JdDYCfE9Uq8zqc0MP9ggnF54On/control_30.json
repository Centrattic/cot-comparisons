It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The story goes like this: the author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza they'd been craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, ate two slices, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's perspective: he paid for a specific pizza he wanted, ordered it for himself and his girlfriend. He expected her to maybe take a piece or some toppings, but instead, she modified all the slices, which he found inconsiderate. His anger stems from feeling that her actions were selfish, especially since he had already eaten part of the pizza.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She agreed to have some of whatever he got. She might have thought that since he had already taken two slices, she could take what she wanted from the remaining ones. She might not have realized that modifying all the pizza would affect his enjoyment, especially since it was a specific type he wanted. She might also feel that since he had already eaten, her actions weren't that big a deal.\n\nNow, considering typical relationship dynamics. Communication is key. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza exactly as ordered, so maybe he should have mentioned that. However, the girlfriend modified all the slices without considering that he might not want them altered. That's a bit extreme. Taking some toppings might be a normal thing for her, but doing it to all pieces could be seen as not respecting his preferences.\n\nThe author's reaction: calling her selfish and inconsiderate led to an argument. But is his anger justified? He did order the pizza for both of them, and her actions made the pizza less enjoyable for him. However, he could have communicated his preferences beforehand. On the flip side, she didn't ask if modifying the pizza was okay before doing it. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author might have assumed that she would take a piece or just some toppings, not alter all the slices. The girlfriend might not have realized the impact of her actions. However, the author's reaction was to call her names and start an argument over something that could have been resolved with a conversation. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both could have communicated better. But the question is specifically about the author. Since he initiated the fight by getting angry and escalating the situation, even if he felt wronged, his reaction might be considered disproportionate. However, if the girlfriend's actions were indeed disrespectful, then his anger isn't entirely unwarranted. \n\nBut in relationships, how we handle disagreements matters. The author could have discussed his feelings without attacking her. His use of language (\"fucking\", calling her selfish) might be seen as contributing to the conflict. So while his feelings are valid, his response might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if her actions were indeed selfish and he's justified, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the balance here is that both have some responsibility, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he started the fight by getting angry and using harsh language, even if he felt justified, his response could be seen as the problem. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But others might argue that she was the one who did the inconsiderate thing, so he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the situation is about starting a fight over pizza, which is a minor issue, and his reaction led to a big argument, maybe he's overreacting. However, his feelings about her actions being selfish might be valid. It's a tough call. In many cases, these sorts of situations are about communication, and the author didn't set boundaries before ordering. So perhaps he shares some responsibility for not clarifying his expectations. That would make him at least partially at fault. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be A. But some might say B. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering that he escalated the situation, maybe A is correct. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was clearly being selfish, then B. But the scenario says she took toppings off all pieces, which could be seen as selfish. But maybe she didn't realize. \n\nHmm. I think the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. Since the pizza was ordered for both, and she modified it without considering his preferences, his anger is somewhat justified. However, his choice of words and calling her names might be inconsiderate. So the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) for his reaction, but if the question is about the act of starting the fight, then maybe he is. Alternatively, if the fight was justified because of her actions, then he's not. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person is often found not in the wrong if they are defending their reasonable expectations. Here, expecting that ordering pizza for two wouldn't have all toppings removed might be reasonable. Therefore, the answer might be B. But I'm a bit conflicted. I think the key is that the author didn't set clear expectations, but his reaction was harsh. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his anger is a reaction to her inconsiderate action, even if his delivery was harsh. The core issue is her taking without considering his preferences. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe how he expressed it. However, the question is about starting a fight. If he started it by getting angry, but the cause was her action, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the correct answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because his reaction, while perhaps heated, is in response to his girlfriend's inconsiderate act. The problem lies in her modifying all the pizza without consideration, not his anger over it. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
