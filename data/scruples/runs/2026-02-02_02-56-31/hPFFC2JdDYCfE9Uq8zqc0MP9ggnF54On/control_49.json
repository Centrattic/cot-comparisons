It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV.\n\nThe girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When she came back, she didn't eat anything. He asked why, and she said she took toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered expensive pizza, expecting to share. They asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said yes, so he ordered for both. But then she ended up modifying all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. She thought it was fine, saying she didn't take all the cheese off, and he was overreacting.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that since he ordered pizza intending to share, her actions were disrespectful. He might think that taking toppings off every piece is being selfish because it makes the pizza less enjoyable for him. Also, he was starving and maybe expected the pizza to be eaten as is.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being considerate by taking off toppings, maybe because she doesn't like them. She might not have realized that removing toppings so thoroughly would affect his experience. She might have thought that since he had already taken two pieces, it's okay for her to adjust the remaining pizza to her taste.\n\nNow, considering communication. The author asked if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. But maybe he didn't specify that he wanted the pizza to stay as is. If he had mentioned that he wanted the pizza to be eaten as ordered, maybe she would have known. However, he ordered it for both of them, so he might reasonably expect her not to alter it in a way that affects his consumption.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of taking toppings off every piece do seem inconsiderate. Even if she likes the toppings less, removing chunks of cheese and toppings from all pieces would make the pizza less enjoyable for him. She might have a different preference, but modifying the food that both are supposed to share without considering the other person's preference is problematic. \n\nThe argument escalated because the author felt his request was ignored, and she thought her actions were acceptable. The key point is whether her actions were selfish. If the author expected the pizza to be eaten as is when ordering for both, then her modifying it without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if she thought it was okay to adjust the pizza to her taste, maybe she didn't realize the impact.\n\nBut the fact that she took from every piece, not just one or two, and then dismissed his anger as overreacting suggests she didn't consider his feelings. The author's anger might be about the principle of sharing food and expecting it to be respected. \n\nSo, in terms of who is in the wrong, the girlfriend's actions were more about her own preferences without considering his. The author might have overreacted in calling her selfish and bringing up other issues, but the initial action of modifying the pizza was inconsiderate. However, maybe the author should have communicated his preference for the pizza to be eaten as is from the start. \n\nBut given that he ordered for both and she agreed to have some of whatever he got, she might have thought it was okay to adjust it. However, removing toppings so thoroughly that it's unrecognizable could be seen as going beyond reasonable modification. In that case, the author's reaction is understandable, but maybe his approach was harsh. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend altered the shared food without consideration for his preferences, the author's anger is somewhat justified. However, escalating to a big argument and calling her selfish might be over the top. So maybe the author is partially at fault for the argument's escalation. \n\nBut the main issue is whether starting the fight was his fault. If the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, then his reaction, while maybe intense, isn't entirely his fault. Alternatively, if he should have communicated his expectations better, then maybe he shares some blame. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often judged on whether their reaction is proportionate. The author ordered pizza intending to share, and the girlfriend's actions made the pizza less enjoyable for him. His anger is about her inconsideration. However, calling her selfish and leading to a big argument might be proportionate or not. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. However, maybe the author could have handled it better. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the main issue is the girlfriend's actions. So the author's reaction, while maybe intense, is a response to her inconsideration. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
