It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the guy was really craving pizza from a specific place because it's worth the price. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted any, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he gets. He orders it, takes two slices, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, she says she didn't eat any, just wanted some toppings. He thought she took a couple of toppings off. But then he goes to the kitchen and finds every single piece had toppings and cheese removed. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue. She says he's overreacting.\n\nNow, the user is wondering if he's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's think about this. The key points here are communication, expectations, and the reaction.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend said she just wanted some toppings, which he interpreted as taking a few pieces' toppings. But she actually took from every piece. That's a bit of a miscommunication. He didn't explicitly say the pizza was for him only. When he asked her if she wanted anything, she said she'd have some of what he gets, which might imply she expected to share the pizza he ordered. But maybe he didn't clarify that he ordered it for himself specifically. \n\nHowever, she took a lot more than just \"some toppings,\" which is excessive. Removing toppings and cheese from all the pieces could be seen as taking without considering his feelings, especially if she didn't need to do that. His reaction might be inconsiderate because he didn't check with her first, but her action was inconsiderate in return. \n\nOn the other hand, he could have communicated better. Maybe he should have specified that he ordered for himself and that she should ask if she wanted to share. But she also didn't clarify her needs beforehand. The argument seems to stem from both not being clear. However, his anger might be disproportionate if he didn't explicitly state that the pizza was his. But she did say she'd have some of what he gets, so she might have expected to share, and his frustration is understandable when she took more than expected. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he didn't set boundaries, then maybe he shares some responsibility. But she overstepped by taking more than she said. However, the argument escalated because of his anger. The question is whether his reaction was in proportion. The user is asking if he's wrong for being angry over her actions. \n\nI think both have some responsibility here. But the main issue is whether the user's anger was justified. If he didn't communicate that the pizza was for him alone, then his anger might be unwarranted. However, her action of taking from all the pieces could be selfish. So maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because her actions were inconsiderate, and his anger, while maybe intense, is a reaction to her behavior. But maybe it's a bit of a toss-up. However, since she said she'd have some of his pizza, he might have expected her to take a reasonable amount, and she took too much. So he's not wrong for being upset.\n"
