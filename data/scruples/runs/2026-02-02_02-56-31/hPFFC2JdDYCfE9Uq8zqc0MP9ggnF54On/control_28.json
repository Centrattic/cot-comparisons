It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fight over pizza between a boyfriend and girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was craving pizza from a specific place, which is more expensive but worth it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. He orders it, takes two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, she's not eating. He asks why, and she says she took toppings off the pizza. He assumed she took toppings from one or two pieces, but later finds out she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The girlfriend agreed to have some of the pizza he ordered, but then took toppings off all the pieces. The boyfriend was probably expecting they'd share the pizza as is, maybe each taking a piece. Instead, she modified the pizza in a way that made it less enjoyable for him, perhaps ruining the remaining slices. He felt it was selfish because she was altering the food he paid for, which he might see as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay to take what she wanted from the pizza, especially since he already took two pieces. She might not have considered that removing toppings from all slices would make the remaining pizza less appealing to him. However, her action of taking toppings from every piece might be seen as going too far, as it affects the rest of the pizza he intended to eat.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was getting angry and calling her selfish. The girlfriend responded by saying he was overreacting and acting childishly. The key here is about expectations and communication. Did the boyfriend clearly express that he expected the pizza to remain intact? Or did he assume she would take only a small part, as she initially said? The girlfriend might have thought she could take toppings without affecting his meal, but taking from every piece might have been more than he expected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The boyfriend did order the pizza with the understanding that she would have some of it, possibly as a shared meal. If she wanted to take just the toppings, maybe she should have done it in a way that left the pizza mostly intact for him. However, the boyfriend's anger might have been disproportionate, especially if he had already eaten his two pieces and the rest was still there, just modified. But if the modifications made the remaining pizza inedible for him, that's a problem.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions could be seen as selfish because she altered the food that was part of their shared order, which was intended for both of them to enjoy. The boyfriend's frustration is understandable if the remaining pizza was no longer suitable for him. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. Instead of yelling, maybe he could have discussed it calmly.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the boyfriend might not be entirely in the wrong for being upset, but his reaction could have been more measured. The girlfriend's actions were perhaps inconsiderate, but the boyfriend could have handled the situation better. However, the question is whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were the main issue, then the boyfriend isn't in the wrong. But if he overreacted, then maybe he is. The answer would depend on whether the boyfriend's anger was justified.\n"
