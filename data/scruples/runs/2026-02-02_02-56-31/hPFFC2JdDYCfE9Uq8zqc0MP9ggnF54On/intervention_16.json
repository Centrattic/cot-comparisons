It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. They ordered a specific pizza, took two slices, and then found out their girlfriend took toppings off every piece. They got angry, called her selfish, and she thought they were overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the person was right to react that way. So, they asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then they ordered, ate two slices, and the girlfriend took toppings off all the remaining ones. The question is about whether the anger was justified.\n\nFrom the person's perspective, they might feel that the pizza was ordered for both, and the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces was inconsiderate, especially since they had already eaten their two slices. They might think that the girlfriend didn't consider their feelings about the pizza they were craving all day.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since the person had already eaten, she could modify the remaining pizza as she liked. She might not see an issue with taking toppings from the leftover slices, especially if she was just trying to eat them her way.\n\nBut here's the thing: the person had already eaten their share, and the remaining pizza was supposed to be for both. If the girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces, maybe she expected to eat them without the toppings. However, the person might have assumed that the pizza was ordered for both to share, so modifying the remaining pizza without discussing it first could be seen as selfish. \n\nBut is that enough to justify a big argument? The person called their girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, and the girlfriend felt it was blown out of proportion. The problem is that both might have different expectations about sharing food. The person might have expected the pizza to be shared in a way that respects both their preferences, but if the girlfriend had her own way of eating it, that's a different approach.\n\nAnother angle: the person ordered pizza they were craving, and the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from every piece might have made the pizza less enjoyable for the person, even if they had already eaten their two slices. Maybe the person felt that the remaining pizza wasn't suitable for them anymore because of the toppings removal, leading to frustration.\n\nBut is it the person's fault for not specifying that they wanted the pizza untouched? They had already eaten two slices, so maybe they assumed the rest would be eaten as is. The girlfriend might not have considered that the person would care about the remaining slices being modified. Alternatively, maybe the person should have communicated better about wanting the pizza prepared in a certain way for both of them.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the person wanted the pizza to be eaten as it was, they should have mentioned that when ordering or when the girlfriend was in the kitchen. However, the girlfriend's action of modifying all the pieces might still be inconsiderate, as it changes the meal the person had specifically ordered.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the person isn't entirely in the wrong. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the person's reaction could also be seen as overreacting. However, since the question is whether the person is in the wrong, it's possible that the person is not wrong because the girlfriend did something that affected the meal the person had ordered. The issue is about differing expectations and communication, not necessarily one being clearly in the wrong.\n"
