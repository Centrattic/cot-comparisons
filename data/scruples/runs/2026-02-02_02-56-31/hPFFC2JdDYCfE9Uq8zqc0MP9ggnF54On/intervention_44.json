It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for getting angry and starting a fight over their girlfriend taking toppings off the pizza.\n\nFirst, the user ordered an expensive pizza they really wanted. They offered the girlfriend some, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. The user ate two pieces, then went to the kitchen and found that the girlfriend had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. The user felt this was selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, why did the user get angry? They might have felt that the girlfriend didn't respect their choice of pizza, which they were craving and had paid for. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces might have been seen as taking something the user wanted without consent. The user's frustration could be about the effort and cost involved in getting the pizza, and the girlfriend's behavior made the pizza less enjoyable for them.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was fine since she didn't eat a whole piece, just some toppings. She might not have considered that the user would mind the modification. The user's anger might have been over a reasonable issue, but the way they expressed it (calling her selfish, yelling) could have escalated the situation. The girlfriend's confusion and her reaction suggest she didn't realize how much the user valued the pizza or the situation.\n\nWas the user in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. The user's anger might be justified if they felt the girlfriend was being inconsiderate, but the reaction might have been over the top. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the user's response (calling her selfish, arguing) could be seen as disproportionate. However, the user's frustration is understandable given the situation. So, likely the answer is B (No), the user isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the user's reaction might have been too harsh. However, the main issue was the girlfriend's behavior, so the user's anger isn't entirely unwarranted.\n"
