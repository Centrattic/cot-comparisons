It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza between a guy and his girlfriend.\n\nSo, the guy was craving pizza from a specific place all day. He ordered it, told his girlfriend he was getting it, and offered her some. She said she'd just have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings and some cheese off every piece. The guy got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The guy ordered pizza because he was starving. He offered the girlfriend food, and she said she'd have some of it. Then, he took two slices and left. The girlfriend took a long time in the kitchen. When he checked, she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He was upset because he thought she took some toppings, but in reality, she took a lot. The guy called her selfish, and she accused him of being a child.\n\nSo, key points to consider: Did the guy have a right to be upset? Was the girlfriend's action selfish? Did the guy overreact? Or was he justified in feeling angry over his expensive pizza being ruined?\n\nThe guy ordered the pizza because he was hungry. He shared it with his girlfriend, who didn't take a whole slice but took parts from all the pieces. The girlfriend might have felt she was saving money since he was already paying, but the guy paid for it and was hungry. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces might have been inconsiderate, as it made the pizza less enjoyable for the guy. \n\nHowever, the guy's reaction of calling her selfish and being angry might be seen as overreacting, even if he felt wronged. Arguments over food can be trivial, and the girlfriend might have had a different perspective. But the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, especially since the pizza was a specific place he wanted and expensive. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The guy might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe his reaction was harsh. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the argument might have been overblown. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend did take parts from all the pieces, that's a significant action. The guy's anger could be justified if he felt his food was being ruined, especially since he paid for it. The girlfriend's confusion and dismissal of his feelings might have escalated the situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and while the argument was intense, the guy had a reason to be upset. But maybe some would say he overreacted. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces is more of a problem. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
