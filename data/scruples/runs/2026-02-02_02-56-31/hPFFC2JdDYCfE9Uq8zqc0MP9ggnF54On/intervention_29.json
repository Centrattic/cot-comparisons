It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The main points are:\n\n1. The person ordered pizza from a specific place they really wanted because it's expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd take some of whatever they got. \n\n2. The person took two pieces and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When they came back, she said she didn't eat because she wanted some toppings but not the whole piece. The person thought she took toppings off a couple of pieces. But when they went to the kitchen, they found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece.\n\n3. The person got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate. She thought they were overreacting and called them childish. The argument escalated.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about expectations and communication. The person ordered the pizza for themselves, thinking the girlfriend would take some if she wanted. But the girlfriend ended up taking a lot from all the pieces, making them angry. \n\nWas the person wrong? Well, they ordered the pizza because they really wanted it, but maybe they should have been clearer about not wanting her to take from their order. On the other hand, the girlfriend said she would take some, but when she did, she took more than expected, which might have been a miscommunication. \n\nThe person might not be entirely in the wrong because they had the right to expect that their order wasn't going to be stripped of toppings. But maybe they could have communicated better. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from every piece, which left the pizza less for the person, could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe question is, does the person deserve the blame? Considering that the girlfriend's actions were unexpected and went beyond what was reasonable, the person's anger might be justified. So maybe the answer is B (No, not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a point where the person could have acted differently. Like, maybe they should have been clearer about not wanting her to take from their pizza. But since the girlfriend misinterpreted her initial statement, the person's reaction could be seen as a valid response to her inconsiderate action.\n"
