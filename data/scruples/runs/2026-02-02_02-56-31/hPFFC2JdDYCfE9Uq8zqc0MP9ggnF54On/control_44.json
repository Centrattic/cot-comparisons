It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from an expensive place because they were craving it. The girlfriend said she would have some of what the author gets, but when the pizza arrived, the author ate two pieces. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long time, and when she came back, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The pizza was ordered for both of them, and the girlfriend indicated she wanted some. However, when the author took two pieces, maybe the expectation was that there would be enough left for both. The girlfriend taking the toppings off all pieces might have left the author with less than they wanted. But was the author wrong to get angry?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the girlfriend's action was selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought she was saving money by not ordering more or that the author had already had their share. The key points here are communication and expectations. Did the author clearly state that they wanted to keep some pizza for later or wanted to eat their two pieces and leave some for the girlfriend? If the author ordered the pizza intending to share, but the girlfriend altered the pizza in a way that made it inedible for the author, that's a problem.\n\nBut maybe the girlfriend didn't realize the extent of her actions. She might have thought taking some toppings off a couple of pieces was enough. However, taking all the toppings off every piece is excessive. The author's anger is justified if they felt their meal was ruined. On the other hand, the author could have been more considerate in their approach, maybe discussing the situation calmly instead of getting into an argument. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of calling the author a child for blowing things out of proportion might be valid if the author overreacted. However, if the action of removing toppings made the pizza inedible for the author, then the author's frustration is understandable. The main issue here is about shared expectations and communication. The author might have assumed the girlfriend would take only a small amount, but she took more than expected. However, the author's response of calling her selfish and starting a fight could be seen as disproportionate if the situation wasn't that severe. \n\nIn terms of fault, both parties might have some responsibility. The author could have checked with the girlfriend before eating two pieces to ensure there was enough left. The girlfriend might have communicated better about her intentions. However, the act of removing all toppings from every piece is a significant action that would likely affect the author's meal. So, while the author's reaction led to a fight, the girlfriend's action was the initial problem. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both to improve communication.\n"
