My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me go through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author was really craving pizza and ordered it from a specific place, which is a bit more expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but would have some of whatever he gets. He orders it, takes two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When he notices she didn't eat, she says she took toppings off some pieces. He thought she took toppings off one or two, but actually, she took it off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The author feels justified because he thinks it was selfish, but she said he was overreacting.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The girlfriend said she would have some of the pizza he got. He ordered it, took two pieces, and she ended up taking all the toppings off every piece. That seems like she didn't eat any pizza and just took the toppings from all the pieces. The author might have felt that was inconsiderate because he was the one who paid for the pizza, maybe? But he had already taken two pieces, so the rest were there for her. However, she didn't eat any and modified all the pieces. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for getting angry? Well, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as selfish. She said she wanted some, but then took all the toppings, leaving the pizza inedible or not as desired for him. The author might have felt disrespected, especially since he paid for it. On the other hand, maybe the author overreacted. The girlfriend didn't take all the cheese off, but enough to make it not his preferred pizza. Also, the argument escalated, bringing up other issues. \n\nThe girlfriend was confused and thought it wasn't a big deal. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be valid, but the way the argument happened could be a problem. Maybe the author should have communicated better instead of reacting angrily. But the act of taking toppings off all pieces without discussing it first could be the girlfriend's fault. \n\nSo, the author's anger might be justified if the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish. However, arguments are often about how people handle the situation. The author could have approached it calmly instead of starting a fight. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the girlfriend did something inconsiderate, he might not be in the wrong for being upset. However, the way he reacted (calling her names, escalating the argument) might be where he went wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that the author kept the pizza in the kitchen after ordering it. Maybe he should have brought it into the living room so both could eat together. But he was in the living room eating his two pieces, and she was in the kitchen. If the pizza was left in the kitchen, maybe she had access to it. \n\nIn summary, the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful, but the author's reaction might have been too harsh. It's possible that the author is in the wrong for overreacting, but maybe not entirely. The answer depends on whether the argument's escalation was his fault or if the girlfriend's actions were truly inconsiderate. The key point is that the author called her names and they brought up other issues. If the girlfriend's actions were selfish, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But since the question is whether he is in the wrong for starting the fight, maybe the answer is B (No) because the initial action (girlfriend taking toppings) was the problem, and the author's anger was a reaction to that. However, the way he handled it could be better, but the underlying issue might not be his fault. So the answer is B.\n"
