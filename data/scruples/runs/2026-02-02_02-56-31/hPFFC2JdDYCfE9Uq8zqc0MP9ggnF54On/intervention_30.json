It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. So the guy ordered pizza from his favorite place, which is a bit pricier but worth it. He told his girlfriend he was starving and offered her some. She said she didn't want anything, just some toppings. He assumed she meant taking a little off the pieces he ordered. Then, after he ate two slices, he went to the kitchen and found that she had removed toppings and cheese from every single piece. He got angry and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy paid for the pizza, which he was looking forward to. He might have felt that his order was his to enjoy, and the way she altered the remaining slices could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that taking some toppings was acceptable, especially since she didn't eat the whole pizza. She might have felt that she was just using the food she had access to, and perhaps didn't realize the emotional value the pizza had for him.\n\nThe key points here are expectations and communication. The guy didn't specify that he wanted the pizza as ordered, and the girlfriend didn't clarify what she meant by wanting \"some toppings.\" There's a lack of clear communication here. The guy might have overreacted by calling her selfish and inconsiderate, which could escalate the situation. However, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from every piece might seem excessive, especially if she wasn't eating the pizza herself.\n\nAnother angle is the value placed on the pizza. Since it's from a specific, more expensive place, he might have had higher emotional attachment. The girlfriend might not have considered that aspect. But she might also feel that since he ordered it for both of them, she has a right to use the remaining slices as she sees fit.\n\nThe argument escalated because of the lack of prior discussion. The guy didn't ask her to leave the pizza as is, and she didn't confirm how much she wanted. So, both parties could have communicated better. However, the guy's reaction was to call her names and start a fight, which is a strong response. The girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't intend to disrespect him, but her actions did affect his experience.\n\nIn terms of fault, the question is whether the guy was wrong to get angry. Since the situation is over something trivial, but the actions taken (removing toppings from all slices) could be seen as unnecessary and inconsiderate, there's a middle ground. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal boundaries. However, the main issue is the lack of communication from both sides leading to a misunderstanding. The guy might have been in the wrong for overreacting, but the girlfriend's actions also contributed. However, the question is specifically about the person asking (the guy) being in the wrong. If he acted out of proportion, then the answer is A. If he had valid reasons, then B.\n"
