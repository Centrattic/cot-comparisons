It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza, ate two slices, and then found out their girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the remaining slices. The girlfriend didn't eat any of the pizza herself, just took the toppings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They ordered the pizza, mentioned they were starving, and offered the girlfriend a piece. She declined but later took the toppings. The author thought the girlfriend would take some toppings from one or two slices, but she did it to all. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the girlfriend didn't eat the pizza and took what she wanted without considering the author's feelings. The author might feel that the girlfriend was inconsiderate. But maybe the author didn't communicate their expectations clearly. They assumed the girlfriend would take from one or two pieces, but she took from all. The author's reaction was to call her selfish and start a fight, which could be seen as overreacting. On the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful, but she didn't eat the pizza. The author might feel violated that their food was altered without consent. It's a matter of perspective. The girlfriend might not see it as selfish, just taking what she wanted. But the author's anger is understandable. So, is the author wrong? Maybe not entirely. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction could be seen as over the top. However, since the girlfriend took the toppings without consent, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
