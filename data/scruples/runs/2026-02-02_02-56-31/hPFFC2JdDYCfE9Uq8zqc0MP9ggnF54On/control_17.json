It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario is that the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and asked if she wanted anything. She said she'd have some of whatever the author got. Then, the author ate two pieces, went to the living room, and when they went to the kitchen later, the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author ordered pizza for themselves, invited the girlfriend to join, but she declined. Then, when the author went to the kitchen, he found that the girlfriend had removed toppings from all the pizzas. The author felt it was selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The author was clear about ordering pizza for themselves and offered to get something for her as well. She declined, so maybe she didn't expect the author to share the leftovers. However, when she took toppings off all the pieces, that might have affected the author's enjoyment of the remaining slices. The author's anger could stem from feeling that their meal was ruined or that the girlfriend didn't respect their preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might think that since the author had already eaten their share, she was entitled to adjust the leftovers as she saw fit. She might not have considered how the author might feel about the remaining pizza. However, the author's reaction might be seen as overreacting if the girlfriend didn't have ill intent. The argument escalated because the author called the girlfriend selfish and acted like a child, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nBut the girlfriend did take from every piece, not just the leftovers. If the author had already eaten two pieces, there's still pizza left for the author. The girlfriend's action might have been inconsiderate, especially if the author likes the toppings. The author's initial offer to share was made, so the girlfriend's actions might have been taken as selfish. However, the author's response was to call her names and escalate the argument, which could be their fault.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author overreacted. The girlfriend might not have realized the impact of her actions. The author's anger was about the selfishness, but maybe the girlfriend didn't intend to be selfish. The author's reaction might be justified if they felt their meal was compromised. However, the way they handled it\u2014calling someone selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument\u2014could be seen as the author's fault for not communicating calmly.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have asked why she did that instead of immediately getting angry. The girlfriend might not have known it was a dealbreaker. The author's anger might be proportional if the toppings were a big deal, but the way they handled it could be their fault. Alternatively, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, so the author isn't entirely wrong.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. The answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was justified. If the girlfriend's actions were truly inconsiderate (taking toppings from all pieces, not just leftovers), then the author's anger is understandable. However, if the author overreacted by calling the girlfriend selfish and escalating the argument, then the author is at least partially at fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong overall.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who escalated the conflict is often considered at fault. The author's choice of words (\"selfish,\" \"inconsiderate\") and bringing up past issues might have contributed to the fight. However, the initial action of the girlfriend was the trigger. The answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend's action was problematic, but the author's handling was poor. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. In this case, maybe the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, but the way the author reacted might have exacerbated the situation. But in AITA questions, often the answer is B (not in the wrong) if their anger is justified but their method is poor. So maybe B is the answer here.\n"
