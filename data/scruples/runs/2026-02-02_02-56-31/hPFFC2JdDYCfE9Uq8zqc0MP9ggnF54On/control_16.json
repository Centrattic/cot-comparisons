It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they were craving, told their girlfriend, and she said she would have some of whatever they got. Then, when the pizza arrived, the author ate two pieces, went to watch TV, and later found out that the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces, leaving them inedible for the author's taste. The author got angry, called her selfish, and a big argument ensued.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author was clear they were hungry and wanted a specific pizza they were craving. They offered the gf to have some, and she said she would take some toppings. The author probably expected her to just take a couple of pieces or maybe not take any, but instead, she ended up ruining the pizza by removing toppings from all pieces. That's a significant action. The author's reaction is frustration because the pizza they paid for and were craving is now not what they wanted. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought she was being considerate by taking only a little, but went too far without considering that the author wanted the pizza as it was. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author might have assumed the gf would take a small amount, but she did something more extensive. The gf might not have realized the impact of her actions on the author's craving and the cost. The author's anger stems from the pizza being ruined, which is a valid reaction given the circumstances. However, escalating it into a big argument could be seen as disproportionate. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author's anger is about the selfish act of ruining the pizza, but maybe overreacting. However, the gf's actions were inconsiderate. The author didn't do anything wrong by ordering the pizza they wanted and sharing it. The main issue is the gf's behavior, not the author's. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
