It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author ordered a pizza they were craving, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, ate two slices, then went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nNow, I need to analyze who's at fault. The key points here: The girlfriend said she'd eat some of his pizza, so the author might have expected her to take a piece or two. Instead, she took toppings off all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. The author's reaction was to call her selfish and start an argument.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he paid for the pizza, ordered it specifically, and expected her to take a reasonable amount. Her taking toppings off all pieces might have made the pizza less enjoyable for him, especially if he was craving it. He felt that her actions were selfish because she altered the pizza in a way that affected his experience.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, she said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. She might have thought taking toppings off a few pieces was okay, but ended up doing all of them. She might not have realized how much it would bother him and was confused by his anger. She might also feel that since he had already eaten two pieces, the rest was hers to modify as she saw fit.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Anger over something as trivial as pizza can be seen as overreacting. However, if the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the author's reaction might be justified. But here's the thing: he ordered the pizza for himself, even though he asked her if she wanted anything. The fact that she wanted some but ended up altering all the pieces could be a miscommunication. The author's anger might stem from her not respecting his order and his craving, but he also didn't check if she wanted to take any before he ate two slices. Maybe he should have considered that she might take some, so eating two first might have left less for her. However, she said she didn't want anything, which he believed.\n\nThe girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all the pieces was probably the main issue. He might feel that she ruined his meal, which he was looking forward to. On the other hand, the argument escalated because he called her selfish and inconsiderate, which could be harsh. The girlfriend's confusion and her defending herself by saying he had his own pieces might be valid, depending on how the pizza was shared.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a balance. He might have overreacted in calling her selfish, but her actions could be seen as selfish as well. However, the initial question is about the author being in the wrong for starting the fight. If the fight was because of her actions, then maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But if his reaction was disproportionate, then he might share some blame. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed the pizza order more clearly, expecting her to take some. She could have clarified her needs instead of modifying the pizza. But the main point here is that the fight started because of her actions and his reaction. Since the question is about the author being in the wrong, if his anger was justified, then he's not in the wrong. If it was an overreaction, then he is.\n\nGiven that the pizza was ordered specifically, and he was craving it, her altering all pieces might have been the problem. His anger could be justified because he paid for it and was looking forward to it. But calling her selfish and inconsiderate might be too harsh. So, maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because her actions were inconsiderate, but the way he reacted could be better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight. Since the fight was over her actions, maybe he's not in the wrong. But perhaps the answer is A (Yes), because he overreacted. Hmm, tricky.\n\nAlternatively, considering that he ordered the pizza for himself, and she said she'd take some, but ended up taking all toppings, he might have a point. The answer might be B. But I need to make sure. The key is whether his anger is justified. If she took toppings off all pieces, making the pizza less enjoyable for him, he's not wrong in feeling upset. But the way he reacted (calling her selfish) might be harsh. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just the reaction. Since she did something that affected his meal, he's not in the wrong for expressing his frustration. So B.\n"
