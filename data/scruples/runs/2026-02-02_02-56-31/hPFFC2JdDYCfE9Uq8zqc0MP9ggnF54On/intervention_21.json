It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the user ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it. They mentioned it's a bit more expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he orders it, eats two pieces, and the girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When he notices she hasn't eaten, he asks why, and she says she took toppings off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The user thought \"having some of the pizza\" meant she'd have a slice or part of it. She interpreted it as just taking toppings off for herself. He might have expected her to eat some pizza, but she didn't, which he found selfish. She thought she was okay with just the toppings.\n\nFirst, maybe the user didn't clarify what he meant by \"she could have some.\" He assumed she'd eat a slice, but she had a different idea. On the other hand, she took toppings from all pieces, which he found inconsiderate because he was paying for the pizza and wanted to eat it as is. \n\nBut does that make him wrong? Well, the argument started because of a miscommunication. He ordered the pizza intending to share, expecting her to eat part of it, but she modified it in a way he didn't like. However, he didn't specify how she should partake. So maybe he overreacted by calling her selfish, especially since she didn't take all the pizza. She took toppings, which he might not have anticipated. \n\nBut she could have asked if he was okay with her taking toppings. He might have felt it was his pizza since he paid for it, so altering it without consent could be seen as inconsiderate. However, he did offer her some, so she might have thought she could have parts of it. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. The user's anger might be over a small thing, but his girlfriend's actions did change the pizza he wanted to eat. The main issue is communication. He didn't specify his expectations, and she didn't ask. So maybe both are a bit at fault, but the user's reaction was to call her selfish, which could be seen as overreacting. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the user might be partially at fault for not being clear, but the girlfriend also modified the pizza without discussing it. However, since the user asked the question if he's in the wrong, the answer might depend on cultural norms or personal expectations. In many cases, people might think the user overreacted, hence answer A (he's wrong), but others might say the girlfriend was inconsiderate, so he's not at fault (B). But given the phrasing, maybe the answer is A because he could have communicated better and his reaction was harsh. Alternatively, maybe B because she did take toppings without consent. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. \n\nBut considering that he ordered the pizza for both of them, expecting her to eat part of it, and she modified the pizza he paid for without asking, maybe he's justified in feeling upset. However, escalating to a fight over it might be his fault. The answer might be A because the fight was his choice to start. Alternatively, if the situation is that she did something he didn't like without consent, maybe B. I think the answer is A because the user should have clarified his expectations instead of getting angry. So the answer is A.\n"
