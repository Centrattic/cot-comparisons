It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user ordered expensive pizza, told his girlfriend he was going to get it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no, but then took toppings off all the pieces later. He got angry and called her selfish, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, did he do something wrong? He ordered the pizza intending to share maybe, but she initially said she didn't want anything. Then she took toppings off the pieces he ordered. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nHe felt it was a selfish act, but she didn't think so. The user's anger might come from feeling like she took without asking and ruined the pizza. But maybe he should've communicated better. Did he specify that he wanted the pizza as is? If he ordered it for himself and didn't mention not wanting others to alter it, maybe she didn't realize. Also, she did take some, but not all, and left it edible. He called her names and acted like a child, which might be where he went wrong. The problem could be communication from both sides. He might have been inconsiderate by not clarifying his order was for himself only, and she was inconsiderate by altering it without asking. But since he escalated the situation with name-calling, he might be in the wrong for his reaction. So answer A: Yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
