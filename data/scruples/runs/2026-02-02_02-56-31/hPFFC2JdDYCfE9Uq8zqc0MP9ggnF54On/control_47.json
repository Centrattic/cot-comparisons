It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza between the author and their girlfriend. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was really craving pizza from a specific, more expensive place. They ordered it and offered the girlfriend some, which she declined, saying she'd have some of whatever he got. The author then took two pieces and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while and came back without eating. When the author asked why, she said she took toppings off some pieces. But when he checked the kitchen, he found she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nSo, the key points here are the expectations and communication. The author ordered the pizza intending to share it, as he asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything. She said no but implied she might take some later. However, when the author went to the kitchen, he found all the pizzas modified, which he saw as selfish. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought it was okay because he had already taken his two pieces and didn't mind if she took the toppings from the rest.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author felt that the girlfriend was being inconsiderate by taking all the toppings, making the pizza less enjoyable for him. However, he did order the pizza, and even though he asked if she wanted anything, she initially refused. The girlfriend might have thought that since he had his pieces, she could take the toppings as she didn't want a whole piece. But she didn't communicate this clearly, leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that the effort and cost of the pizza were not respected. The girlfriend, however, might not have considered that removing toppings from all the pieces would affect the author's enjoyment. There's a communication breakdown here. The author didn't clarify that he wanted to eat the pizza as is, and the girlfriend didn't ask for permission before altering the pizza.\n\nHowever, the argument escalated quickly. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be seen as an overreaction, especially since the girlfriend didn't take the entire pizza, just the toppings. The cost of the pizza was a factor, but the girlfriend's actions might not have been entirely inconsiderate. Maybe she just wanted the toppings and didn't think about the impact on the author's remaining pieces.\n\nSo, considering all this, both parties might have some responsibility here. The author could have been clearer about his expectations, and the girlfriend could have communicated her intentions before altering the pizza. The author's reaction, while understandable, might have been a bit harsh, leading to the argument. Therefore, the answer is probably that the author is not in the wrong (B), but there's room for both to improve communication.\n"
