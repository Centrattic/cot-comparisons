It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering pizza they really wanted, the girlfriend saying she didn't want anything but would take some toppings from the pizza. However, when the author goes to the kitchen, he finds that the girlfriend took toppings off every piece, not just one or two. The argument ensues, with the author feeling that her actions were selfish and inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author ordered pizza for himself, and his girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece but wanted some toppings. The author assumed she would take a little from one or two pieces, but she took from all. The author then got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether the author overreacted. The girlfriend didn't order pizza, but said she wanted some toppings. The author might have thought that the pizza was for him and that she was taking too much. However, since the pizza was already ordered and the girlfriend didn't take all the cheese, just some, maybe the author's reaction was disproportionate. The girlfriend might have felt entitled to some of the pizza since she mentioned wanting it earlier, even if it wasn't a full piece. The author's anger leading to a big argument could be seen as overreacting, especially since it's just pizza. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece might be seen as inconsiderate as well, as it affects the author's enjoyment of the pizza. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The author initiated the argument by getting angry and calling the girlfriend selfish. While the girlfriend's action might be inconsiderate, the author's response might have been the start of the conflict. So maybe the author is partially at fault for overreacting. However, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as selfish too. The answer might depend on whether the author's anger was justified or if he escalated the situation unnecessarily. Since the author called the girlfriend selfish and she defended herself, leading to a bigger argument, the author's actions might have been the catalyst. Therefore, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because he overreacted and started the fight. But I need to be careful here. The girlfriend did take from all the pieces, which might be an issue. However, the author could have communicated his concerns instead of getting angry. In relationships, communication is key. The author might have been right to be upset but handled it poorly. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's anger was a reaction to that. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the author started the fight by getting angry, then maybe he is in the wrong. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was the one who was inconsiderate, the author's anger might be justified. The answer might be B, but I'm not sure. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If he is not in the wrong because the girlfriend was being selfish, then B. If he is in the wrong for overreacting, then A. Given that the author's anger led to a big argument, but the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, in relationships, both parties can have some fault. But the question is specifically about the author starting the fight. The author did start the argument by getting angry and calling her selfish. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for escalating it, even if he felt wronged. So the answer might be A. But I need to be careful here. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction was the start of the conflict. So the answer is A.\n"
