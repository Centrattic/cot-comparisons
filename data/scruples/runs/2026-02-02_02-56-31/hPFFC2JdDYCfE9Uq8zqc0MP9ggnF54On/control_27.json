It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza.\n\nThe author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they were craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but would have some of what they get. Then they order it, eat two pieces, and when they check the kitchen, they find all the toppings taken off every piece. The girlfriend thought it was okay because she didn't take all the cheese, and the author got angry, calling her selfish. The girlfriend thought the author was overreacting.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: sharing food, expectations of how it's used, and communication. The author ordered pizza for themselves but invited their girlfriend to have some. The girlfriend took toppings off every piece, which the author found selfish. But she didn't take the whole pizza, just some toppings. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author might feel that since they paid for the pizza (as it's more expensive), they expected to share it. The girlfriend might have thought since she didn't want a whole slice, taking toppings was acceptable. But taking toppings from every piece could be seen as taking more than her share, especially if the author was eating two slices and the rest were for others. However, the author might not have clarified that the pizza was for both, even though they asked if she wanted anything. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions might be inconsiderate, but the author's reaction could be disproportionate. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. Maybe the author should have discussed it calmly instead of escalating. On the other hand, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from every piece could be seen as taking without consideration. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely wrong, but maybe they could have handled it better. However, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. So, depending on perspective, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B (No) because the author's anger is justified in feeling their partner was selfish, but maybe they overreacted. However, the core issue is about shared expectations. If the author expected to share the pizza equally, the girlfriend's action was wrong. But if the author thought they were getting their own and the girlfriend was taking from leftovers, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author has a right to feel upset. However, the way they reacted (calling her selfish and inconsiderate) might have been harsh. But the main issue is the action of the girlfriend. So the author isn't entirely wrong.\n"
