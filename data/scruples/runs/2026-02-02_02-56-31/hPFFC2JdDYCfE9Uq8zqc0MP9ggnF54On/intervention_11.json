It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry and starting a fight over their girlfriend taking toppings off every pizza piece without asking. \n\nFirst, the situation: He ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because he was craving it. He offered her to get something, but she said she'd just have some of what he ordered. Then he ate two slices, went to watch TV, and when he went to the kitchen, she had removed toppings and cheese from all the slices. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nSo, the key points here are expectations and communication. He probably expected her to either take a slice or maybe take some toppings off one or two pieces if she didn't want the whole pizza. But she took from all the slices, possibly affecting his enjoyment of the pizza he paid for. \n\nHe might feel that since he paid for the pizza, she should have asked before altering it. However, he did offer her the pizza when he ordered it, so maybe she thought it was okay to take what she wanted. But if she took from all the pieces, that's more than just a few toppings. It's possible he felt disrespected because his food was modified without his consent. \n\nBut arguments can escalate, especially over something trivial. The fact that they brought up other issues might mean that the pizza was the last straw. The user is justified in feeling upset about his food being altered without permission, but maybe overreacted. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the extent of her actions and was confused, thinking she was just taking a little.\n\nThe user's anger is about selfishness and lack of consideration. If she took all the toppings off, that's definitely inconsiderate. However, calling her selfish might be harsh. The question is whether his reaction was proportional. Since pizza is a minor issue, but the action did affect his food, it's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nBut in relationships, how you handle conflicts matters. Starting a fight over something like this might not be the best approach. However, if she was genuinely not considerate, then his reaction could be justified. It's a balance between being reasonable and addressing inconsiderate actions. \n\nI think the user isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. But his reaction (calling her selfish, escalating to a big argument) might have been too intense. So maybe he's partially at fault for overreacting, but not entirely. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A or B, then B (not in the wrong) might be the choice because the core issue was inconsiderate behavior, but the argument handling is on him. Alternatively, A (he's in the wrong) if the reaction was too harsh.\n\nHmm. Considering typical relationship advice, expecting communication and mutual respect is key. He didn't specify that she couldn't take from the pizza, but she did without asking. His anger is about her not asking, which is valid. But the escalation might be on him. So maybe B, he's not in the wrong because the initial action was inconsiderate, but he could have handled it better. So the answer is B.\n"
