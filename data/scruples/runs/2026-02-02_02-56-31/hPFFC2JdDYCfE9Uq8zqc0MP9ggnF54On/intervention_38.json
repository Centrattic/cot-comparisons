It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that he ordered pizza because he was craving it from a specific place, which is a bit expensive but worth it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he gets. Then he orders, takes two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she did, taking toppings off. But when he went to the kitchen, he found that she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off every piece.\n\nThe user got angry and called her selfish and inconsiderate. She thought he was overreacting and said he was acting like a child. The argument escalated. The user is wondering if his anger was justified.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girlfriend said she would just have some of whatever he gets, which he might have interpreted as being okay to take a piece or two. However, she ended up taking toppings off all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. The main issue here is the act of taking toppings from all the pizza slices, which might have made the pizza less enjoyable for him. \n\nNow, considering consent and communication. When he ordered the pizza, he assumed it was for both of them. However, the girlfriend didn't ask for permission to take toppings off all the pieces. That's a problem because she altered the food that was meant to be shared without consulting him. \n\nBut then, is it reasonable to get angry over that? It's a matter of perspective. Some might say that the pizza was his, and if he wanted to share, he should have ordered more. Others might think that taking toppings off all the pieces is disrespectful and inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle is the way the argument escalated. The user called his girlfriend selfish, which is a strong term, and she felt he was overreacting. Arguments can sometimes be about more than the immediate issue, so maybe there are underlying tensions. \n\nAlso, the fact that she took toppings from every piece is significant. Even if she didn't take all the cheese, removing toppings from all slices would definitely affect how the pizza tastes for him. If he wanted to eat it as it was, she made that impossible. \n\nBut was the initial request for a fight justified? The user's anger might be proportionate if he felt disrespected or that his preferences were not considered. However, starting a fight over it might have been avoidable. Maybe a calm discussion would have been better. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend didn't ask for his permission to alter the pizza, which was a shared meal. That's inconsiderate. The user's reaction, while perhaps intense, might stem from feeling disrespected. However, blowing up into a fight might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but the way he handled the situation (calling her names and escalating the argument) could be seen as wrong. The question is whether he was in the wrong for starting the fight. If the act of her taking the toppings without asking was the trigger, then maybe he had a valid reason to be upset, but the response could have been more measured. \n\nIn summary, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the user's reaction might have been excessive. So the answer might be that he's not in the wrong for the initial anger but perhaps in the way he handled it. However, the question specifically asks if he's in the wrong for starting the fight. If the fight was caused by a valid grievance (her taking the toppings without asking), then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the fight was overreacting to a minor issue, then he might be. The line between valid and overreaction can be blurry here.\n"
