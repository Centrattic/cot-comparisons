It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether they were in the wrong for getting angry and starting a fight over their girlfriend taking the toppings off their pizza. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is more expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he gets. So he orders, takes two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, he noticed she wasn't eating. She said she did, but took toppings off. But when he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the user was in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFrom the user's perspective: They paid for the pizza, which was a specific, expensive place they were craving. They ordered it, ate two pieces, and expected the rest to be available. The girlfriend didn't ask, just took what she wanted, modifying the remaining slices. The user felt disrespected and inconsiderate, hence the anger. They might believe that since they ordered the pizza and paid for it, the rest belongs to them, and the girlfriend's actions were selfish.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She agreed to have some of what he gets, not necessarily the exact same pizza. She might have thought it was okay to take toppings off without asking, especially since he had already taken his two pieces. She might see this as a minor action and not a big deal, hence the confusion when he got angry. Her response of being annoyed and calling him a child suggests she felt he overreacted.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The user assumed the rest of the pizza was his to eat as he wanted, while the girlfriend took what she wanted without considering that. However, the user could have considered that when he ordered the pizza, he might have shared it, even if he paid for it. On the other hand, the girlfriend could have asked or communicated her request first.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, he did start a fight over it. Even if he felt wronged, the reaction might be disproportionate. The argument escalated, bringing up other issues, which might have been unnecessary. The girlfriend's actions, while inconsiderate in his eyes, might not be deserving of such a strong reaction. The user could have addressed it calmly instead of getting angry. However, the girlfriend's actions were also a bit inconsiderate, not asking first.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user could have been more explicit about his expectations when ordering. The girlfriend should have asked if she wanted to modify the pizza. But the user escalated it by getting angry and calling her names. So while both could have handled it better, the user's reaction might be the main issue here. The question is whether his anger was justified. Since it's just pizza, maybe he overreacted. But if the girlfriend's actions were a pattern, it could be a bigger issue. However, in this single instance, the user might be in the wrong for starting a fight over something that, while inconsiderate, isn't a huge deal. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe they're both at fault, but the question is specifically if he's in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes, he is. If B, then no. I think the user's anger was disproportionate, so he's in the wrong. Hence, answer A.\n"
