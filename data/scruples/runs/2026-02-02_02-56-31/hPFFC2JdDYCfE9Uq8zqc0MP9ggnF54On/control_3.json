It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The user ordered a specific pizza they were craving, asked their girlfriend if she wanted some, she said no but would have some of what he gets. He orders it, eats two pieces, and then later finds out she took toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was hungry, ordered the pizza he wanted, and thought he was sharing. He even asked if she wanted something. The girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece but just some toppings. The author assumed she took toppings off one or two pieces, but instead, she took from every piece. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author might have expected her to take a small amount, maybe leaving some for him. But the girlfriend might have thought that since he already had his share, it was okay to take what she wanted. However, she went to the extent of taking from every piece, which the author found inconsiderate. \n\nBut wait, the pizza was ordered by him, paid for by him, and he was the one who ate first. The girlfriend didn't order her own pizza. So, if she's taking from the pizza he bought, even if he had already eaten some, maybe she should have communicated better. She thought he had his share, but taking toppings off all pieces left the rest less enjoyable for him. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. Maybe he overreacted. However, the girlfriend's action of taking from every piece could be seen as thoughtless. The author's frustration is understandable, but getting angry over pizza might be disproportionate. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. Even if the author was wrong to yell, her taking all the toppings could be a valid point of contention. The question is whether the author's reaction was justified. If the author felt disrespected by her actions, then maybe not in the wrong. But if the argument was overblown, then maybe he is. \n\nBut the main issue is the girlfriend taking from all the pizza. The author might have thought she'd take a little, but she took a lot. So the author's anger could be seen as a reaction to her inconsiderate action, not the pizza itself. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But he could have handled it better without yelling. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just the reaction style. \n\nThe girlfriend did take from the pizza without asking, which the author paid for. She might have thought it was okay since he had his share, but the author expected them to share. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't entirely unwarranted. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
