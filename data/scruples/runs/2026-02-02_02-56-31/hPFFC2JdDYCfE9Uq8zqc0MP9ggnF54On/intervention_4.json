It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry and starting a fight over pizza.\n\nSo, the situation: He ordered an expensive pizza he really wanted, told his girlfriend he was getting it and offered her some. She said she didn't want a whole piece but wanted some toppings. He assumed she meant taking from one or two slices. But when he went to the kitchen, she had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. She was confused and said he was overreacting.\n\nFirst, think about his perspective. He was craving this pizza, maybe even had to pay a bit more for it. He ordered it expecting to share, but she ended up taking from all the slices, which he saw as selfish. He might feel like she didn't consider his feelings or the effort he made to get the pizza. The fact that she took from every piece, not just one or two, could feel like she was being inconsiderate, especially if the pizza was his main meal.\n\nOn the other hand, her perspective: She said she didn't want a whole piece, so maybe she thought taking toppings off all slices was her way of having a little. She might not have realized how much he wanted the pizza. She might have felt it was okay because he had already taken his two slices first. Her confusion and saying he's overreacting suggests she didn't see it as a big deal.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, getting angry over this is a subjective matter. However, was his reaction proportionate? Taking toppings off all the slices could be seen as taking more than she needed, affecting the rest of the pizza. But maybe he could have communicated better, or maybe she should have clarified. However, calling her selfish and inconsiderate might be harsh. Arguing over pizza might be a minor issue that escalated due to underlying tensions. So, maybe he's not entirely wrong, but perhaps he overreacted a bit. However, the key point is that she took without considering his preference. \n\nBut in relationships, these situations often depend on communication and understanding. If she had asked for some toppings, maybe he would have shared. But she took without asking. So maybe his anger is justified. But arguing over it might have been unnecessary. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because her actions were inconsiderate, and he has a right to be upset. But it's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is if he is in the wrong. Since she took without considering his preferences, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
