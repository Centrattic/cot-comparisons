It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. They ordered a specific pizza they really wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted something and she said no but would have some of what he gets. Then he ate two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen a while, came back and he noticed she wasn't eating. She said she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nSo the question is: am I in the wrong here?\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user ordered the pizza he wanted, expecting to share with his girlfriend. She agreed to have some. He ate two pieces, then later found out she took toppings off all the pieces. He felt it was selfish, but she didn't see it that way. \n\nHe might think that since she agreed to have some, she should have just taken a piece or part of one, not modify all the pieces. She might think that since he had already eaten his two pieces, it's okay for her to take what she wants from the remaining ones. Maybe she didn't consider that he might want to eat more or that she was altering the food he paid for.\n\nWas it reasonable for him to get angry? Well, the pizza wasn't just for him; he ordered it intending to share. But she didn't take a piece, which he might not have anticipated. However, modifying the food might be seen as inconsiderate because he might not like the way it's been altered. On the other hand, he did eat two pieces first, so maybe she thought it was okay to take the toppings from the remaining ones. \n\nBut the key point is communication. He didn't ask her if she wanted a specific type of pizza, but she did say she would have some of what he gets. If he ordered a specific kind, maybe she didn't mind the toppings. But she ended up taking toppings, which changes the pizza he wanted. So maybe he was right to be upset because she altered his meal without considering his preferences. \n\nHowever, the argument might have been overblown. It's just pizza, and the emotional reaction could have been excessive. But if she modified all the pieces, that would affect his experience. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the user isn't entirely wrong. He had the right to be upset that his food was altered without his consent, especially if he paid for it and it's a specific type he wanted. But maybe he could have communicated better, like asking if she wanted a certain type of pizza or how she wanted to share. Still, her action was inconsiderate, so he's not in the wrong for being angry.\n"
