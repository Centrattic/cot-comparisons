It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user ordered a pizza from a specific place, which is more expensive but worth it. He told his girlfriend he was getting pizza and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but offered to have some of what he got. Then he ordered, ate two slices, and when he went to the kitchen, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, communication. He asked if she wanted anything, and she said no, so he ordered. But maybe she didn't expect to have to eat it immediately. When she took the toppings off, maybe she wasn't aware he would be upset. But he didn't specify that he didn't want her to take from the pizza. Maybe he should have clarified that the pizza was his, or maybe she should have asked first. However, he didn't order it for himself alone; he ordered it for both of them since she said she would have some. So when he took his two slices, maybe he should have considered that she might want to take some as well. But she went to the kitchen and took from every piece, which seems excessive. He's upset because it's a specific pizza he craved, and she took from all the slices, making them less enjoyable. \n\nHe called her selfish and inconsiderate. Was it his fault for not setting boundaries? Maybe he should have mentioned he wanted to keep the pizza intact. On the other hand, she took from every piece without asking. It's a bit of a toss-up. The key points are communication and expectations. He didn't clearly state that the pizza was his alone, but she also assumed it was okay to take from the rest without asking. Since he ordered it for both and she agreed to have some, she might have thought it was shared. But taking from every piece is extreme. I think the main issue is that he didn't clarify his intent to keep the pizza as is, and she didn't ask before taking. Both might be at fault to some extent. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't specify and got angry, maybe he's partially at fault for not communicating his needs. But she also acted without considering his preferences. Probably a 50/50 situation. But the question is AITA, so maybe the answer is that neither is entirely wrong, but the user isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, since he didn't communicate clearly, he might share some blame. Hmm. The user feels justified because she didn't ask and took from all the pieces. The girlfriend might think it's fair to take some since he ordered it for both. So it's a matter of perspective. Answer B (No, not in the wrong) might be correct because the girlfriend took without considering his preferences, even if he didn't specify. But maybe A is also possible. I think B is the answer here.\n"
