It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry over their girlfriend taking toppings and cheese off all the pizza pieces. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The user ordered pizza because they were craving it. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but would have some of what he got. Then when the pizza arrived, he took two slices. She was in the kitchen and later came back without eating. He asked why, and she said she didn't want a whole piece but wanted some toppings. He assumed she took from one or two slices. But later, when he checked the kitchen, she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece.\n\nHe got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument. Now he's questioning if his reaction was justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did he communicate his expectations? Did she have a right to alter the pizza? Was his reaction proportionate?\n\nThe user mentioned that he didn't think she would take all the toppings off every piece. But she did, which he found inconsiderate. The girlfriend didn't ask for permission and assumed she could take what she wanted. He felt entitled to order the pizza he wanted, especially since he paid for it. She might have thought she could adjust the pizza without affecting his meal since he had two slices, but removing toppings from all pieces could affect the taste and his enjoyment.\n\nHowever, maybe he should have been clearer about not wanting the pizza altered. On the other hand, she took it upon herself without discussing, which is inconsiderate. The user's anger might be about feeling disrespected. But is getting angry over this a reasonable reaction? It's a specific incident that led to an argument about selfishness. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was defensive, which could indicate that she didn't realize the impact of her actions. The user might have overreacted by calling her selfish and bringing up other issues, escalating the argument. But she also didn't consider that altering the pizza would affect his meal. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user could be in the wrong if he didn't communicate his preferences clearly. But she's also in the wrong for altering the pizza without consent. Since he's the one who ordered it and paid for it, he might feel it's his choice. However, sharing a meal often involves compromise. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he was clear from the start that he wanted the pizza as-is, then she's at fault. But if he didn't specify, maybe he's responsible for not communicating. However, since she took toppings off all pieces, which could be seen as going too far, maybe he's justified in being upset. \n\nOverall, considering that she didn't ask and did something that affected his meal, the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong). But there's room for argument. However, the user's escalation (calling her selfish, blaming her) might have been too harsh, but the initial action of her altering the pizza without consent is inconsiderate. So the answer is probably B.\n"
