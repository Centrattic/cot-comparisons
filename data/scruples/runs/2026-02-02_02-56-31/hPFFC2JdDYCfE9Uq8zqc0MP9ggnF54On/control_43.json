It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from an expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said no, but would have some of whatever he got. So he ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to the living room. She was in the kitchen for a while, then came back without eating. He asked why, and she said she took toppings off. The author thought she meant one or two pieces, but she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author assumed that when she said she would take toppings, it would be from a few pieces, but she did it to all. The girlfriend didn't communicate clearly. She might have thought it was okay since he had already eaten his own pieces. However, the act of removing toppings from all the pizza could be seen as taking without asking and affecting what the author wanted to eat. \n\nThe author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish. The girlfriend then accused him of being a child. The question is whether the author is wrong. \n\nFrom a perspective, the author might have a point because the girlfriend altered the food in a way that wasn't discussed. However, the initial decision to order that pizza without considering that she might not want toppings could be an issue. Also, maybe the author should have checked again if she wanted something, but she said she didn't. \n\nBut since she modified the pizza without his consent after he had already eaten his share, that's where the conflict arises. The author's anger comes from the fact that she didn't respect his preference. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction led to a big argument. \n\nHowever, the argument is about communication. If she had asked first, maybe this wouldn't have happened. The author's anger is justified in the sense that she changed the food without talking to him. But maybe the author overreacted by calling her names and escalating the situation. \n\nIn terms of fault, the main issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend. The author's reaction, while perhaps intense, is a response to her actions. But since it's about a personal preference, maybe the author is at least partially at fault for not being clear. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms or relationship dynamics. But in general, the girlfriend's actions were the direct cause. The author's anger is a reaction to that, so the main fault is on her. However, the argument could be seen as the author overreacting. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend took it upon herself to modify the pizza without discussing, which was inconsiderate. The author's anger is a reasonable response to having his food altered without consent.\n"
