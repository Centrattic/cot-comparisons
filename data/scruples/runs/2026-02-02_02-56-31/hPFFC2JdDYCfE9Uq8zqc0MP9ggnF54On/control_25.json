It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered a pizza they really wanted, which was a bit expensive. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but would have some of the pizza he got. Then when he got it, he ate two pieces, and she came back not eating. He thought maybe she took toppings off a couple of pieces, but when he went to the kitchen, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. First, the girlfriend said she would have some of the pizza he got. But then when he ordered it, she didn't take a whole piece but took toppings off every piece. The author thought that was selfish because the pizza was his, but she modified it in a way he didn't expect. But is the author in the wrong here?\n\nWell, when he asked if she wanted anything, she said she would have some of whatever he got. So maybe he assumed that meant she would take a slice or two. But she didn't take a whole piece, just the toppings. But by taking toppings off all the pieces, maybe she was being inconsiderate because now he can't eat the pizza as he wanted. However, he had already eaten two pieces, so maybe he didn't consider that she might want to have some of the remaining pizza. But he ordered it, so maybe it's his to do with as he likes. But then again, if she agreed to have some, maybe he should have ordered more or considered sharing it. \n\nAlso, he called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be harsh. She might have thought it was okay to take the toppings since he had already had his two slices. The author's anger could be over the top because she didn't take whole slices but just modified them. However, he was clear he was craving this pizza and it was expensive, so maybe she should have respected that. \n\nBut the girlfriend's actions were unexpected. Taking toppings off every piece might be seen as ruining the pizza for him. So maybe the author is not entirely wrong to be upset. On the other hand, starting a big argument over this might be disproportionate. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have escalated it. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend did something that affected his enjoyment of the pizza, maybe he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
