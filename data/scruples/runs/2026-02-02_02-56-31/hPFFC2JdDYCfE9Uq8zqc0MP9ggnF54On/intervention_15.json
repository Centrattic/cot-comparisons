It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about pizza. The guy ordered pizza because he was really craving it from a specific place, even though it's a bit more expensive. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, but would have some of whatever he got. Then he orders it, takes two slices, and goes to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he checks, she said she took toppings off all the slices.\n\nHmm, first, maybe the guy didn't clarify that he wanted to eat the pizza himself. He asked her if she wanted anything, and she said no. But maybe he should have known she might take some in another way. Or maybe she didn't communicate that she wanted to take toppings off instead of having her own slice. \n\nBut wait, when he asked her, she said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The guy thought that meant taking toppings off one or two slices. But she actually took them off all of them. That's the problem. He probably thought he was being considerate by offering her some, and she took it in a way that ruined his pizza for him. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she just wanted the toppings without the crust, and didn't realize he wanted to eat the whole pizza. But if he had known that she would take toppings off all the slices, maybe he should have specified that he wanted to eat them as is. \n\nBut here, the key point is that she didn't take a whole slice, but modified the existing ones. The guy got angry because she altered the pizza in a way he didn't expect. However, she was in the kitchen for a long time, so maybe he could have checked earlier. But he didn't think about it. \n\nThe question is whether his anger was justified. He felt she was selfish for taking toppings off all the slices, which made the pizza not as good for him. She thought she was just taking what she wanted. \n\nI think the guy isn't entirely wrong here. He was clear he wanted pizza, and she said she didn't want a piece, but didn't clarify that she'd take toppings. However, when he took two slices, maybe she saw the remaining slices as available to take toppings from. But modifying all the slices would affect his ability to enjoy them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should have specified that he didn't want her to alter the pizza. But since she initially said she didn't want a whole piece, he might have expected her to take just a bit. \n\nIt's a bit of a misunderstanding. But when she took toppings off all of them, that's a lot more than just a bit, and it's reasonable for him to be upset. She didn't consider that he wanted to eat the pizza as a whole. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
