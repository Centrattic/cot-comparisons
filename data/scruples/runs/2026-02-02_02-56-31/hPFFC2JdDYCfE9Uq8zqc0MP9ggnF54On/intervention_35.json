It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that they ordered pizza, ate two slices, and when they went to the kitchen, their girlfriend had taken toppings off all the pieces. They got angry, called her selfish, and it led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The user was clear they wanted pizza and asked if she wanted anything, which she declined. Then, when she took the toppings off all the slices, he felt it was inconsiderate. She might have thought she was being responsible with her portion or maybe she just didn't want the pizza anymore. But why take the toppings off all of them? That seems excessive, maybe she didn't like the pizza or wanted to save it for later? But then why not just put it back or not eat it? \n\nThe user's anger might be because he paid for the pizza, and she modified it without consulting him. The crux here is communication. He didn't ask if she changed her mind about the pizza after he ordered it. She didn't communicate her actions, which left him feeling disrespected. However, the reaction is about calling her selfish and leading to a big argument. Maybe the argument was over a small thing, but the underlying issue could be about respect or communication in the relationship.\n\nIs it fair for him to get angry over her taking toppings off? If he paid for the pizza, he might feel she should have asked first. But she did say she didn't want a whole piece and just some toppings. He thought she took a piece's toppings, but she did all. That's a miscommunication. His anger might be justified in feeling she didn't respect his order, but the argument escalation could be his fault for overreacting. \n\nShe might have been trying to be considerate by not eating the whole pizza, but her method was wrong. However, he could have handled it calmly by talking instead of getting angry. The answer depends on whether the anger was proportionate. The user's actions (calling her selfish) and the argument's escalation might be where he's wrong, even if the initial situation had some fault from her side. Relationships require communication and understanding, so maybe both sides have responsibilities here. But the question is if the user is in the wrong. Given that, the answer might be B (No), because she acted without considering his feelings, but the user could also be in the wrong for overreacting. However, the initial action of taking the toppings without discussing might make the user not in the wrong. So, B.\n"
