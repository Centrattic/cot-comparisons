He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for being mad about how their girlfriend treats their dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user has a St Bernard named Moose, and they've been living with him since he was a puppy. Moose is well-behaved and they have a close bond. The girlfriend, Julia, started staying over, and there are several issues with how she treats the dog. The user is upset because she shouts at the dog, wants him off the sofa, won't give treats, smacks him, makes him sleep in the kitchen, etc. The user has tried to compromise but Julia isn't listening. The main question is whether the user is in the wrong for being upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the treatment of the dog. The user is the owner, so their responsibility is to care for Moose. Julia's actions include things like hitting the dog, which is physically abusive. Even if the user is the owner, Julia's actions are crossing a line. The user is protecting their pet, which is understandable. They've tried to address the issues but Julia isn't respecting their wishes. \n\nThe user isn't in the wrong for being upset about how their dog is being treated. They have the right to expect that their partner treats their pets kindly. Julia's behavior is inappropriate, especially the physical punishment. The user is advocating for their dog's well-being, which is a valid concern. The fact that Julia is jealous might be a red flag too, but the main issue here is the mistreatment of the dog. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). The user is justified in being upset because their partner is mistreating their dog, and they have the right to address it.\n"
