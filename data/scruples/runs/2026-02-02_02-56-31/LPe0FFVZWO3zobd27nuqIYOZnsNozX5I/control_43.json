He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy being upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog, Moose. The guy has had Moose for a while, and they have a good relationship. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over, and there are several issues listed.\n\nFirst, the main points are the author's concerns about how Julia treats Moose. He mentions that she yells at the dog, doesn't follow his rules (like not feeding him treats, smacking him, keeping him in the kitchen), and shows jealousy towards the dog. The author is frustrated because he feels Julia is being cruel and not respecting his pet. \n\nNow, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad about this. The question is whether his reaction is justified. Let's break down each of the points he lists:\n\n1. Julia doesn't give treats when asked. That's an issue because the author might have trained Moose to respond to certain commands, and inconsistency can confuse the dog. The author might have a valid point here.\n\n2. Ignores Moose when he comes for love. If Moose is trying to interact and Julia ignores him, that could be neglectful, especially if Moose is used to attention from the author.\n\n3. Wants Moose to sleep in the kitchen, which is too cold. The author says it's too cold, so Julia's request could be harmful to the dog. The author is right to be concerned about the dog's comfort.\n\n4. Smacked Moose twice. Physical punishment is a major red flag. The author is against it, which aligns with most modern dog training principles that advocate positive reinforcement. Smacking can cause fear and aggression in dogs, so this is definitely a problem.\n\n5. Claims jealousy of the dog. If Julia is jealous, that's more about her emotional state, but it's not an excuse for mistreating the dog. The author's concern here might be valid if her jealousy leads to negative actions towards Moose.\n\n6. She says Moose is annoying despite having three big dogs she loves. This inconsistency is odd. Maybe she's being unfair to Moose specifically, which could indicate a personality issue or something else. The author is right to question that.\n\n7. Screams at him for barking. Moose is well-behaved and rarely barks, so a sudden scream could be stressful for the dog. The author's point about consistency in treatment is valid here.\n\n8. Feeds him less because she thinks he's too big. The author has stopped letting her feed him, which he might be doing to protect Moose's health. Julia's decision to reduce food without consulting a vet could be harmful. The author is justified in not letting her feed the dog if he knows what's best for Moose's diet.\n\nLooking at all these points, the author is clearly concerned about Moose's well-being and is defending his pet's treatment. The girlfriend's actions include yelling, physical punishment, neglecting care, and being inconsistent. The author has made compromises, like leaving the door open, but Julia is not following through. \n\nThe key issue here is the girlfriend's behavior towards the dog, which the author finds unacceptable. Since the dog is the author's responsibility and a significant part of his life, he has the right to set boundaries about how others treat it. The girlfriend's actions are harming the dog, and the author is trying to address these issues. \n\nIn relationships, respect for each other's values and boundaries is important. If the girlfriend can't respect the author's care for his pet, that could be a bigger issue. The author isn't being unreasonable here; he's standing up for his dog's well-being. The girlfriend's actions are the problem, not the author's reaction. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
