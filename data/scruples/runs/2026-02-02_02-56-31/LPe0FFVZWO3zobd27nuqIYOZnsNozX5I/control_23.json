He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog. The author has a St. Bernard named Moose that he's been taking care of for three months. They have a good relationship. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over, and there are several issues.\n\nFirst, Julia shouted at Moose to get out of the room when he was in the bedroom when they were sleeping. The author tried to explain that changing his routine could stress the dog, and they made a compromise by leaving the door open. But then Julia continued to act negatively towards Moose. The author lists eight specific complaints: not giving treats, ignoring the dog when he comes for affection, making him sleep in the kitchen (too cold), smacking him twice, being jealous, calling him annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents, screaming at him for barking, and feeding him less.\n\nThe author is considering telling her to stop, but he's already told her to ignore Moose if she's going to be mean, which she didn't listen to. The question is whether the author is at fault (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author seems to be defending his dog's well-being. He's clearly established that Moose is well-behaved and a big part of his life. Julia's actions include shouting, physical punishment (smacking), and not following the compromise. The author has tried to communicate and make compromises, but Julia isn't respecting the dog's needs or the author's boundaries.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance here. The author allows Moose to be in certain areas of the house, but Julia is a guest. However, they live together now, or at least spend most time at his place. The author might have a right to enforce how his dog is treated in his home. Julia's actions (smacking the dog, not feeding him properly) are problematic. The author is trying to protect his pet, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is being too protective. But given that Julia is new to the dog and he's had him from the start, it's his responsibility to train and care for Moose. The fact that Julia is smacking the dog and not following agreed-upon rules (like feeding him enough) is definitely on her side. The author is just trying to maintain the dog's routine and well-being, which is reasonable. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for his dog, and Julia is not respecting the dog's needs or the author's wishes. The answer should be B (No).\n"
