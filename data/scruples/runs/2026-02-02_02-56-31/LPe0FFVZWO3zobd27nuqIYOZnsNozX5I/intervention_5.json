  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for being mad at how my girlfriend treats my dog?\nI (21m) and my St Bernard, Moose (3m) have a super close relationship. He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset about how their girlfriend treats their dog. They provided a detailed situation, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the user's dog, Moose, is well-behaved and has a close bond with the owner. The girlfriend started coming over, and there are several issues: shouting at the dog, not giving treats, smacking the dog, moving the dog's sleeping area to a cold kitchen, etc. The user feels the girlfriend is being mean because she's jealous of the bond with the dog.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the user's perspective, they've cared for the dog alone for three months, and the girlfriend is now overstepping by treating the dog poorly. The user tried compromises but the behavior continued. The girlfriend's actions include physical punishment (smacking), not respecting the dog's routine, and showing jealousy. These are significant issues. Dogs can be sensitive to changes and negative treatment, so the user's concern is valid.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, maybe she's uncomfortable with the dog in the room, or she doesn't like the dog's behavior. However, her methods are problematic\u2014shouting, smacking, ignoring the dog's needs. The user's rules about how the dog should be treated are being ignored, which is a problem because the dog is the user's responsibility.\n\nThe user has tried to address the issues, but the girlfriend isn't listening. The user's actions in wanting to set boundaries are justified to protect the dog. The girlfriend's jealousy is a red flag here. It's not acceptable for her to mistreat the dog, especially since she doesn't live there and isn't the dog's owner. The user has the right to enforce how their pet is treated, especially when it's being done harmfully.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
