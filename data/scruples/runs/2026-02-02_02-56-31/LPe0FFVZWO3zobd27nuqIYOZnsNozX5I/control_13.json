He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend treating his dog poorly. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author, a guy, has a close bond with his St Bernard, Moose. He's been living with the dog alone and they've been really well-behaved together. Then he starts a relationship with his girlfriend Julia, who lives with her parents. They spend a lot of time at his place. The main issues start when Julia comes over. The dog, Moose, becomes protective around her, which is normal for a big breed. The first problem is Julia shouting at Moose to get out of the room when they sleep over. The author is upset because shouting could stress the dog, and he compromises by leaving the door open. But Julia continues being negative towards Moose in other ways: not giving treats, smacking him, not letting him on the sofas, ignoring him, etc. The author lists several grievances and is considering ending the relationship if she doesn't stop.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are Julia's behavior towards the dog. The author is protective of Moose, which is understandable since he's his pet and they've had a strong bond. Julia's actions\u2014shouting, smacking the dog, restricting his space without consulting, not feeding properly\u2014could be harmful. The author has tried to compromise but Julia isn't listening. The author is trying to set boundaries for his dog's well-being. \n\nPotential arguments against the author: Maybe Julia is just being assertive with the dog, or the author is overreacting to her actions. But smacking a dog for bad behavior is a red flag, as the author mentions he's never had to do that. Also, not giving treats and ignoring the dog when it seeks affection could be signs of neglect or lack of empathy. The author's concerns about his dog's stress and well-being are valid.\n\nSo, considering that Julia's actions are harmful and the author is trying to protect his pet, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
