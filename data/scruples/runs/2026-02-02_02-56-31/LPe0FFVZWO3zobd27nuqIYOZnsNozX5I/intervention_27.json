He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's upset because his girlfriend treats his dog badly. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the guy has a St Bernard named Moose, which is a big dog. He's had Moose since it was a puppy, and they have a close bond. Moose is well-behaved, which is good. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over more, and Moose started being protective, sitting by the guy's side when she's around. That's probably just normal dog behavior when a new person is in the environment.\n\nThen the issues began when Julia started sleeping over. The first problem was Moose being in the bedroom. Julia yelled at the dog to get out, and the guy was upset because of the shouting and how it might affect Moose. They compromised by leaving the door open. But the problems continued. The guy tried to explain that changing Moose's routine would take time, and Julia agreed reluctantly.\n\nThen there are more issues: Julia wants the dog off the sofas, doesn't give treats, ignores him, wants him in the cold kitchen, smacked the dog, is jealous, calls him annoying, yells when he barks, and feeds him less. The guy is now considering telling her this needs to stop.\n\nNow, the question is whether the guy is in the wrong for being mad at how his girlfriend treats his dog. The choices are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, how should we view this? The dog is his responsibility, and the girlfriend is visiting. The guy has the right to set boundaries about how the dog is treated in his home. The girlfriend's actions include yelling, physical punishment, not following the agreed compromise, and other negative behaviors. The guy has tried to communicate and compromise, but she's not respecting his wishes. \n\nThe main points here are ownership and respect. The dog belongs to the guy, so the girlfriend's treatment of the dog in his home could be seen as overstepping. The fact that she's smacking the dog is a big red flag because the guy is against that and has never had to do it. Also, yelling and trying to change the dog's routine without proper training could be harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend feels that the dog is getting too much attention, hence the jealousy. But that's not a valid reason to treat the dog poorly. The guy has a right to be protective of his pet, especially since it's his responsibility and they have a strong bond.\n\nThe girlfriend is being asked to respect the dog's presence and behavior in the guy's home, and she's not doing that. The guy is trying to set boundaries, but she's not respecting them. So, in this case, the guy is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
