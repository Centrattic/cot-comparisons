He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. \n\nFirst, the guy has a St Bernard named Moose, and they're really close. He's raised Moose alone since he got him, and the dog is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over more since they started dating. The guy is upset because she yells at the dog, wants him out of the room when they sleep, hits him, and other things like not giving treats and ignoring him.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that Moose is his best friend, and he's responsible for the dog. He's tried to compromise, like leaving the door open so Moose can come back in. But Julia's actions\u2014yelling, physical punishment, not following his wishes about treats and sleeping arrangements\u2014make him angry. He's firm about not wanting Moose to be hit, which is a valid concern because hitting a dog is generally not acceptable.\n\nOn the other side, Julia might feel that Moose is getting too much attention or that the dog's behavior is intrusive. She's new to the situation, living with her parents, and maybe she's not used to having a dog in the house. However, her actions, like slapping the dog, screaming at him, and not respecting the owner's rules about treats and sleeping areas, seem problematic. The fact that she's smacked the dog twice is a major red flag. Physical punishment can be harmful and is generally discouraged in modern pet care. Also, yelling at the dog could cause stress and anxiety, which is bad for both the dog and the owner's relationship with the pet.\n\nThe author has tried to communicate his boundaries, like not wanting Moose to be hit and respecting his treat schedule. He's made compromises, like allowing Julia to sleep over but keeping the door open for the dog. However, Julia isn't respecting those boundaries, which is causing conflict. The author's concern for his dog's well-being is valid, and it's his responsibility to ensure Moose is treated kindly. If Julia isn't willing to adhere to those terms, then the author is justified in addressing the issue with her.\n\nAnother point is that Julia's jealousy of the affection the author gives Moose might be a personal issue, but that doesn't excuse her treatment of the dog. It's important for a partner to support each other's pets, especially when they live in the same space. Her actions suggest a lack of respect for the author's values and Moose's needs. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, he's standing up for his dog's treatment, which is his right as the owner. He's tried to find solutions, but Julia isn't cooperating. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset; he has legitimate reasons to be concerned about Moose's welfare. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
