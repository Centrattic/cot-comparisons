  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for being mad at how my girlfriend treats my dog?\nI (21m) and my St Bernard, Moose (3m) have a super close relationship. He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for being mad at their girlfriend's treatment of their dog. They've listed several issues: the girlfriend won't give treats, ignores the dog, wants it to sleep in a cold kitchen, smacked it twice, is jealous, says the dog is annoying despite having dogs at her parents' house, screams when it barks, and feeds it less.\n\nFirst, the user clearly cares a lot about their dog, Moose. They mention that Moose is well-behaved and they've raised him since he was a puppy. The girlfriend is new to this situation and her parents still live with her, so maybe she's not used to having a dog in the house. The conflict arises from her treatment of the dog and the user's concern about how it's affecting Moose.\n\nThe user has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open so Moose can come back in at night. But the girlfriend's actions are escalating. The smacking is a big deal because the user is against physical punishment. Also, the emotional impact on the dog, like feeling guilty, is a concern. The user is frustrated because they feel the girlfriend isn't respecting their bond with Moose and isn't following agreed-upon compromises.\n\nNow, considering the user's stance: they want to make the girlfriend stop these behaviors. The key points here are whether the user is overstepping or if the girlfriend is being unreasonable. Since the dog is the user's responsibility and they've raised it, Moose is part of their home. The girlfriend's actions (screaming, smacking, not feeding properly) could be harming the dog's well-being, which the user is justified in being upset about.\n\nFrom an outsider's perspective, the girlfriend seems to be overstepping her boundaries. She's not the dog's owner, yet she's making decisions about his care and treating him poorly. The user is right to be protective of their pet and to set boundaries. The fact that the user has already tried to communicate and compromise, but the girlfriend isn't listening, suggests that the user isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy and negative behavior towards the dog are problematic and justify the user's frustration.\n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The user is protecting their dog's well-being and addressing the girlfriend's inappropriate actions, which are harmful and disrespectful to Moose.\n"
