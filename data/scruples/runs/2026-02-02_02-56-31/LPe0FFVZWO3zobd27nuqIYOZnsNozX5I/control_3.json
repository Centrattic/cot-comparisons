He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is wrong for being upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog. The situation involves the girlfriend treating the dog poorly in several ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a close bond with his dog, Moose, who's well-behaved. The girlfriend started visiting, and there are issues like her shouting at the dog, not giving treats, smacking the dog, changing the sleep arrangement, etc. The author lists several grievances against her.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the elements. The girlfriend is visiting, so she's a guest in the author's home. The dog is the author's responsibility. The girlfriend's actions include physical punishment (smacking), which the author opposes. Also, she's not following the agreed-upon compromise about the dog's sleeping area. She's being jealous of the attention the dog gets, which might indicate insecurity or issues in their relationship.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author has every right to be upset if someone is mistreating his pet, especially when that person is a guest. The girlfriend's actions, like smacking the dog and shouting, are aggressive and could be harmful. The author is trying to protect his dog's well-being and maintain their bond. The fact that the girlfriend is in a new relationship and still lives with her parents might mean she's not fully integrated into the living situation, so her expectations might be unrealistic.\n\nHowever, there's a part where the author allows the girlfriend to interact with the dog, so maybe there's an expectation of mutual respect. But the girlfriend crossed lines by physically harming the dog, which is a serious issue. The author's compromise about the sleeping arrangement was breached when she insisted on moving the dog to the kitchen, which the author deemed too cold. This shows she's disregarding his input and the dog's comfort.\n\nThe author is also concerned about the dog's emotional state, noting that the dog seems sad and guilty after being smacked. This suggests that the girlfriend's actions are causing distress to the pet, which is a valid reason for the author to be upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be frustrated if she feels overshadowed by the dog. The jealousy mentioned could be a red flag for deeper issues in their relationship. However, her response to that jealousy is inappropriate. The author's main duty is to protect his dog's welfare, which he's trying to do by addressing her behavior.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, since the author owns the dog, he has the authority to set boundaries on how the dog is treated, even if someone else is a guest. The girlfriend's actions violate those boundaries, so the author is justified in his anger. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's treatment of the dog is unacceptable.\n"
