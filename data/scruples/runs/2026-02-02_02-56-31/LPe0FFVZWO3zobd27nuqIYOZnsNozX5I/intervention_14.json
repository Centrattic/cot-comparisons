He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset about how their girlfriend treats their dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user has a St Bernard named Moose, who's well-behaved and they've lived together since the dog was a pup. The girlfriend, Julia, came into the picture four months ago. The user mentions Moose being protective of him when Julia is around, which is a normal reaction for a dog. \n\nThe main issues start when Julia sleeps over. She shouts at Moose to get out of the room on the first night, which the user finds upsetting because of the shouting and the sudden change in Moose's routine. They compromise by leaving the door open, but problems continue. Julia then starts being nasty in other ways: not giving treats, ignoring Moose's affection, wanting him to sleep in a cold kitchen, smacking him, expressing jealousy, calling him annoying, screaming when he barks, and feeding him less. \n\nThe user is frustrated because they've tried to communicate and compromise, but Julia isn't following through. They're asking if they're in the wrong for being mad and considering ending it if Julia doesn't stop the behavior.\n\nNow, evaluating this, the key points are the treatment of the dog. Physical punishment (smacking) is a red flag. Dogs don't understand hitting as correction; it can cause fear and aggression. Also, shouting and screaming at the dog can be stressful. The user has a right to be concerned about their dog's well-being. The fact that Julia is imposing rules without considering the dog's needs (like sleeping in a cold kitchen) shows a lack of consideration. The user's dog is part of their household, and the girlfriend's actions are affecting the dog's environment negatively.\n\nJulia's jealousy and not respecting the user's values about treating their dog kindly are also issues. The user has made compromises, but Julia isn't respecting those agreements. The user is acting in their dog's best interest, so their frustration is valid. \n\nAnswering whether they're in the wrong: The user isn't wrong for being upset. They're advocating for their pet's well-being. The girlfriend's actions are problematic, especially the physical punishment and disregard for the user's established care routine. So, the answer is B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
