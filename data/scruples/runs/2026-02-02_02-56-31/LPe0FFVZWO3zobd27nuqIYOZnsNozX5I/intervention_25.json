He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset with how their girlfriend treats his dog, Moose. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user and Moose have a close bond. The dog is well-behaved and lives with the user. The girlfriend, Julia, came into the picture four months ago. She lives with her parents, so they spend more time at his place. Initially, the dog was protective of the user around Julia, which is normal for some dogs, especially with new people.\n\nThen there's the issue with the dog's sleeping arrangements. Julia didn't want Moose in the room while they sleep, leading to a compromise of leaving the door open. But the user says that changing the dog's routine suddenly can be stressful. He tried to educate her on that, which she begrudgingly agreed to.\n\nNow, the user lists several problems: Julia doesn't give treats when asked, ignores the dog's affection, wants him in the kitchen (too cold), smacked him twice, says she's jealous, calls him annoying despite her own large dogs, screams at him when he barks, and feeds him less. The user has told her to ignore the dog if she can't be nice but she doesn't listen.\n\nSo, the user is upset because Julia is mistreating his dog, which he's responsible for. He's tried to compromise and explain, but she's not respecting his boundaries or the dog's well-being. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad.\n\nFrom an animal welfare standpoint, smacking a dog is a red flag. The user is against it, and it's generally considered poor training. Also, the way Julia treats Moose\u2014ignoring him, shouting, feeding him less\u2014can be harmful. The user is the dog's owner, so he has the right to set boundaries on how others interact with his pet.\n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy is another factor. However, that doesn't justify her mistreatment. The user is maintaining his dog's well-being, which is a valid concern. If Julia can't accept the dog's presence and needs to be addressed, then the user isn't wrong to stand up for his pet.\n\nBut could there be a misunderstanding? Maybe Julia feels overwhelmed, but the user has already tried to compromise. Since she's not respecting his rules after being told, it's reasonable for him to enforce them. The answer likely leans towards 'No, you're not in the wrong,' because the user is protecting his dog's welfare.\n"
