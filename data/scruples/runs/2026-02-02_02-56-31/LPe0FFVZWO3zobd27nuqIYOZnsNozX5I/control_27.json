He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong regarding how their girlfriend treats their dog. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a St Bernard named Moose, and they've had him for three months. They live alone with the dog. The girlfriend (Julia) is 23, and they've been together four months. She still lives with her parents, so they spend more time at the author's place. The issue is how Julia treats the dog.\n\nThe author mentions that Moose is well-behaved and that they have a close bond. When Julia started coming over, Moose became protective, sitting by the author's feet. The first problem was Julia shouting at Moose to get out of the room on the first night they slept over. The author was upset because she shouted and thought it could unsettle Moose. They compromised by leaving the door open. But then Julia continued to be negative towards the dog in other ways.\n\nThe list of issues includes not giving treats, ignoring the dog when he seeks affection, wanting him to sleep in the cold kitchen, smacking him, expressing jealousy, calling him annoying despite her own parents having big dogs, screaming at him for barking, and feeding him less. The author has told Julia to ignore the dog if she's going to be mean, but she doesn't listen.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author is the dog's owner and is responsible for its care. The girlfriend is a guest in their home, but she's not living there. The author has the right to set boundaries about how their pet is treated. The girlfriend's actions include physical punishment (smacking), changing the dog's environment (kitchen is too cold), not following the owner's feeding instructions, and being verbally aggressive. These are all things that could cause stress or harm to the dog. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and is trying to mediate, but Julia isn't respecting their wishes.\n\nFrom a pet care perspective, the owner has the authority to decide how their pet is treated. If the girlfriend is violating the owner's rules and harming the pet, the owner is justified in being upset. Physical punishment is particularly concerning because it can lead to behavioral issues in dogs. The fact that the author is trying to find compromises (like leaving the door open) but Julia isn't cooperating suggests that she's overstepping her bounds as a guest.\n\nHowever, there might be some nuance. The girlfriend is expressing jealousy, which could indicate deeper relationship issues. The author might need to address both the treatment of the dog and their relationship dynamics. But the question is specifically about whether the author is wrong in being upset about how Julia treats the dog. Based on the information, the author is protecting their pet from mistreatment, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's actions are problematic, so the author isn't in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
