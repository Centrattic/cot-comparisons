He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad about how his girlfriend treats his dog. He's had Moose since he was a puppy and they have a close bond. The girlfriend started coming over, and there's been a lot of issues with how she treats the dog.\n\nFirst, he mentions the dog's behavior changing when she's around, sitting protectively. Then when she shouts at the dog for sleeping in the room, he argues that yelling could stress the dog. They compromised by leaving the door open. But then she started other things like not giving treats, smacking the dog, putting him in the cold kitchen, etc. The user is frustrated because he's used to handling the dog himself and doesn't like her methods. He's asked her to stop, but she doesn't listen.\n\nSo, the main points here are about the treatment of the pet. The girlfriend's actions include physical punishment (smacking), not following the owner's wishes (feeding, sleeping arrangements), and showing jealousy towards the dog. The user is concerned about the dog's well-being and the girlfriend's behavior. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the dog is the user's responsibility, and he has the right to set boundaries on how others interact with his pet. Physical punishment is generally discouraged in training dogs, so her smacking Moose is a red flag. Also, ignoring the dog's needs like feeding and comfort (sleeping in the cold) is concerning. The user is clearly the primary caregiver, so his girlfriend's actions may be overstepping.\n\nThe user is trying to communicate his boundaries, but she's not respecting them. That's a problem because the dog's welfare is his responsibility. The girlfriend's jealousy and negative reactions might indicate issues with her attitude towards the pet, which is a significant part of the user's life. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user is justified in being upset. He's not in the wrong for standing up for his dog's treatment. The answer should be B (No).\n"
