He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog, Moose.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author, 21m, has a close bond with his dog, who's well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, isn't living there, but when she visits, she's not being nice to the dog. She's shouted at him, moved him away from the bedroom, stopped him from getting treats, smacked him, etc. The author is upset because he sees Moose as his best friend and cares about his well-being. He's tried compromising, like keeping the door open so Moose can come back, but she continues to act negatively towards the dog.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Julia has her reasons. She's new to living with someone's pet, and maybe she's uncomfortable or has different views on pet care. She might not realize how her actions are affecting the dog. But the list of her actions seems pretty harsh\u2014smacking the dog, not giving treats, not allowing him on the sofas, and shouting. These are all things that could stress the dog and might not be in line with positive training methods.\n\nThe author is the owner and is responsible for Moose's care. It's his home, so guests should respect his rules. Julia's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since she's not the owner. The author has tried to address the issues, but she's not cooperating. The key points here are the mistreatment of the dog and the owner's right to enforce how his pet is treated in his home.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his dog and setting boundaries for how his guests should behave in his home. Julia's actions are the issue here, not the author's reaction to them. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
