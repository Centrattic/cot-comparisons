He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author's girlfriend treating his dog poorly. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author has a close bond with his St Bernard, Moose. They've lived together for three months, and the dog is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, started visiting, and Moose became protective, sitting near the author when she's around. That's normal dog behavior, right? Then, Julia shouted at Moose to get out of the room when they were sleeping. The author didn't like that because shouting could stress the dog, and he made a compromise to leave the door open. But the issues continued.\n\nJulia started being \"nasty\" in other ways: not giving treats when asked, ignoring the dog when it seeks affection, wanting him to sleep in a cold kitchen, smacking the dog twice, expressing jealousy, calling the dog annoying, screaming at him for barking, and feeding him less. The author is upset and wants to know if he's in the wrong for being angry about how Julia treats his dog.\n\nSo, the key points are Julia's actions towards the dog. The author is a pet owner, and the dog is part of his life. The girlfriend's behavior includes physical punishment (smacking), which the author is against. Also, she's not following the author's wishes regarding the dog's care, like feeding and sleeping arrangements. \n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, treating a pet poorly is generally frowned upon. Physical punishment is harmful and unnecessary. Julia's actions seem to disregard the author's preferences and the dog's well-being. The author is advocating for his pet's treatment, which is reasonable. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. The girlfriend might feel jealous, but expressing that through mistreatment of the pet is not acceptable. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B (author not in the wrong) because Julia's actions are problematic and the author is protecting his pet's well-being.\n"
