He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. The situation is detailed in the Reddit-style post provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has a close bond with his dog, Moose, who's well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over, and Moose became protective, which is a natural dog behavior. The author allows Moose on the sofa and in the bedroom in a dog bed. However, Julia wanted Moose out of the room at night and later became harsh with him, like smacking him and not giving treats. The author is upset because he feels Julia is being cruel to Moose and is jealous of the affection given to the dog.\n\nNow, the key points to consider here. The author is the owner of the dog and is responsible for his well-being. He has a legitimate concern about the treatment of his pet, especially since Julia's actions include hitting the dog and not following his instructions regarding Moose's care. The author has tried to compromise, like keeping the door open so Moose can stay, but Julia continues to act in ways that the author deems inappropriate.\n\nOn Julia's side, she might feel jealous of the attention the dog gets, and maybe she has her own reasons for not wanting the dog in certain areas. However, her actions\u2014like smacking the dog and being screamed at\u2014cross a line, especially since the author is against corporal punishment and has rules about Moose's care.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and considering ending the situation if Julia continues. From an animal welfare perspective, the author is correct to be concerned about any mistreatment, especially physical harm. The use of smacking as a discipline method is widely discouraged in modern dog training, so Julia's actions here are questionable. Also, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding how his pet is treated in his home.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have addressed the issues earlier or been more understanding of Julia's feelings of jealousy. But given that the author has tried to compromise and Julia continues to disregard his wishes and the dog's well-being, it's reasonable for him to be upset. The author is prioritizing his dog's safety and comfort, which is understandable and responsible.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. Julia's behavior towards the dog is problematic, and the author has every right to stand up for his pet. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
