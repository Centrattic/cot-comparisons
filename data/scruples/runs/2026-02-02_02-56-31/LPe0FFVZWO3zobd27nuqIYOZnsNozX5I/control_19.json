He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation with their girlfriend and their dog.\n\nFirst, the author has a close bond with their St Bernard, Moose, and they've been living together for three months. The relationship is good, and the dog is well-behaved. Then they start dating Julia, and she comes over often. The issues start when Julia is in the room. The author mentions that Moose is protective, sitting by their feet or on the other side of the sofa when they're together. That seems like a normal protective behavior from the dog, maybe feeling the need to be close to their owner.\n\nThe first problem is when Julia shouts at Moose to leave the room. The author is upset because she shouted and that could stress the dog. They compromised by leaving the door open so Moose could stay. But then Julia continues to be mean to the dog in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, even though she doesn't live there, which seems a bit odd. The author feels Moose is part of the family, so maybe Julia should respect that.\n\nJulia is jealous of the affection given to the dog. The author says they're affectionate with her too, but that doesn't necessarily mean Julia should be upset. It's possible Julia feels neglected, but that's not a valid reason to treat the dog poorly. The smacking is a big issue because the author is against it and Moose was visibly upset. Physical punishment on a dog is generally discouraged, so that's a red flag.\n\nThe list of issues includes not giving treats, ignoring the dog when it seeks attention, making it sleep in a cold kitchen, screaming at it for barking, and feeding it less. These actions could lead to fear or anxiety in the dog. The author has tried to address these issues but Julia isn't listening. The author is considering ending the relationship if things don't improve.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The key points are whether the author is overstepping by controlling how Julia interacts with the dog. Since the dog is the author's responsibility, they have the right to set boundaries on how others treat it. Julia's actions are harmful and disrespectful to the pet, which is part of the author's household. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their dog and setting those boundaries. Julia's behavior is problematic, and the author is justified in addressing it. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
