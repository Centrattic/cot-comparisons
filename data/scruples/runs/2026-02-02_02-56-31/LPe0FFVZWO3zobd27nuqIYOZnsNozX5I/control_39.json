He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. The situation involves several issues.\n\nFirst, the author's dog, Moose, is well-behaved and they have a close bond. The girlfriend, Julia, doesn't seem to like the dog much. She's been shouting at him, not giving treats, smacking him, and making him sleep in the kitchen. The author is frustrated because he thinks she's being mean to his pet, especially since he's the one who owns the dog and Moose is his responsibility.\n\nNow, the key points here are about mutual respect in the relationship. The author is responsible for the dog's care, so Julia's actions\u2014like smacking the dog or not following agreed compromises\u2014could be seen as crossing boundaries. The user is upset because his feelings for Moose are being disregarded, and Julia isn't respecting his boundaries regarding the dog's treatment.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance here. The author allows Moose to be on the sofa and in the bedroom, but Julia doesn't agree. The author has to balance his relationship with Julia while maintaining his bond with Moose. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. Since Julia's actions are affecting the dog negatively, and the author is the one responsible for the dog, it's reasonable for him to be upset. The answer would depend on whether Julia's behavior is unjustified. Since the author is standing up for his pet's well-being, it's unlikely he's in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
