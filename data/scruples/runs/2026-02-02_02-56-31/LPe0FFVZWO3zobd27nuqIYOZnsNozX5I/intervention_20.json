  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for being mad at how my girlfriend treats my dog?\nI (21m) and my St Bernard, Moose (3m) have a super close relationship. He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old guy with a St Bernard named Moose. He and Moose are really close, and Moose is very well-behaved. His girlfriend, Julia, is 23 and they've been together four months. She lives with her parents, so they mostly spend time at his place.\n\nThe main issue is how Julia treats Moose. The user is upset about her behavior towards the dog. Let's go through the points he listed:\n\n1. Julia doesn't give Moose treats when asked. That's a problem because the user wants her to interact positively with Moose.\n2. She ignores Moose when he comes to her for affection. That's another negative interaction.\n3. She wants Moose to sleep in the kitchen, which the user says is too cold. That could be uncomfortable for the dog.\n4. She smacked Moose twice for bad behavior. The user is against physical punishment, and Moose was sad afterward.\n5. She's jealous of Moose. That's emotional and might affect how she treats him.\n6. She says Moose is annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she likes. Inconsistency here.\n7. Screams at Moose when he barks. Moose is usually calm, so this could be stressful for him.\n8. Feeds him half the amount, thinking he's too big. The user stopped allowing her to feed him.\n\nThe user tried to compromise initially by leaving the door open so Moose could come back. But Julia continued her behavior, and the user is now considering ending the relationship if it doesn't stop.\n\nNow, considering if the user is in the wrong. The key points are the treatment of the dog and the user's responsibility as the owner. Julia is a guest in his home, so she should respect his rules regarding Moose. The user is advocating for his dog's well-being. Julia's actions\u2014smacking the dog, not providing treats, isolating him in a cold area, and yelling\u2014could be harmful. The user has a right to set boundaries for his pet's care. Since Julia is not living in the home, her influence should be within the agreed-upon boundaries. The user isn't wrong in wanting to protect Moose from negative treatment. Julia's jealousy and inconsistency in handling the dog might indicate deeper issues, but the user isn't at fault for being upset about his dog's treatment.\n\nAnswer B: No, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
