He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're being an a**hole (AITA) for being mad at how their girlfriend treats their dog.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author, a 21-year-old guy, has a 3-month-old St Bernard named Moose. They live together, and the dog is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, 23, has been over a lot since she lives with her parents. The main issues are her treatment of the dog: shouting, not giving treats, smacking him, making him sleep in the kitchen, etc. The author is upset about these things and wants to know if he's wrong to be mad.\n\nSo, what's the key here? The author is clearly attached to his dog and sees him as a family member. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is new to the living situation and may not understand the bond the author has with Moose. The author is the dog's owner, so he's responsible for his care. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like smacking the dog, not following feeding instructions, and being hostile\u2014could be harmful. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend does live with her parents, so maybe she's coming from a different environment where dogs have different rules. She might not realize that her behavior is inappropriate. However, the author is the one who owns the dog and should set boundaries about how the dog is treated in their home. The girlfriend's actions seem to be overstepping, especially the smacking, which the author disagrees with. \n\nThe author tried to compromise by leaving the door open for the dog, but issues continued. The list of grievances includes specific actions that are harmful or disrespectful to the dog. The author's response was to ask her to ignore the dog if she's going to be mean, which she didn't follow. \n\nNow, considering animal welfare, smacking a dog is generally discouraged as it can lead to fear or aggression. The girlfriend's jealousy of the dog is also a red flag. The author is right to be protective of his pet, especially if the dog is well-behaved and the treatment is negative. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author has the right to set boundaries for how his dog is treated in his home. Since the dog is his and he's the primary caregiver, he's not in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's actions are the problem here. So the correct answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
