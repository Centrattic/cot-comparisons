  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for being mad at how my girlfriend treats my dog?\nI (21m) and my St Bernard, Moose (3m) have a super close relationship. He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for being mad at how their girlfriend treats their dog. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the user has a close relationship with their St Bernard, Moose. They live together, and Moose is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over and there are issues with how she treats the dog. The user is upset about several things: Julia shouting, not giving treats, smacking the dog, not allowing him on the sofa, making him sleep in the kitchen, etc. The user has tried to compromise but feels Julia is being unfair and harmful to Moose. They want to know if they're justified in being angry and if ending or changing the relationship is warranted.\n\nLooking at the key points: The user is the owner of the dog, which means they have the authority over how the dog is treated in their home. Julia is a guest, so her actions in their home could be problematic. The user has already tried to address the issues and made compromises, but Julia isn't respecting those boundaries. The dog's well-being is a concern here. Hitting the dog, shouting, and not allowing him to sleep in his usual spot could be signs of mistreatment. The user's frustration is valid because they care about their dog's emotional and physical health.\n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy is a red flag. She's projecting her own insecurities onto the dog, which isn't healthy. The user's stance on not wanting physical punishment is correct, as positive reinforcement is the recommended method. The user has a right to be upset when someone else treats their pet poorly, especially since the dog is a family member to them.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user isn't in the wrong for standing up for their dog. They've tried to communicate and find solutions, but if Julia continues to disrespect their home rules and the pet's care, the user is justified in addressing it more firmly. The answer here should be B (No, they're not in the wrong). The user has every right to enforce boundaries to protect their pet's well-being in their own space.\n"
