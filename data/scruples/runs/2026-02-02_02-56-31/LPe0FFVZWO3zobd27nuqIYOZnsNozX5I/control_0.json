He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author has a close bond with his dog, Moose, who's well-behaved. His girlfriend, Julia, is new to the situation and they're spending time at his place. The issue starts when Julia starts sleeping over. She yells at Moose to get out of the room, which the author finds harsh because Moose was just going about his routine. Then there are other instances where Julia doesn't give treats, ignores the dog, wants him in the kitchen (cold), smacks him, and shows jealousy.\n\nThe key points here are about how Julia is treating Moose. The author is against physical punishment, which is a valid concern because smacking a dog isn't a recommended training method. Also, yelling at the dog could cause stress. The author mentions that Moose is sensitive to sudden changes, so Julia's actions might be affecting him negatively.\n\nJulia's behavior includes several things that the author disagrees with, like not giving treats, ignoring the dog, changing his sleeping arrangements without considering his comfort, and using physical punishment. The author has tried to compromise but Julia isn't listening. \n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, he's the owner and primary caregiver of Moose. He's responsible for the dog's well-being. If Julia is acting in a way that's harmful or stressful for Moose, then the author has a right to be upset. The fact that Julia is a guest in his home and doesn't live there might mean that her rules shouldn't override his. The author is trying to maintain the dog's routine and comfort, which is important for the animal's health.\n\nOn the other hand, Julia might feel that her needs are also valid. She might be uncomfortable with the dog sleeping near her or might have different opinions on training methods. However, the way she's handling it\u2014yelling, smacking, not following the agreed compromise\u2014could be seen as overstepping. Especially since the author has made it clear that he's against certain actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The answer seems to hinge on whether Julia's actions are acceptable or not. Since physical punishment and yelling are not advisable, and the author is the one responsible for the dog's care, he's justified in addressing the issue. The fact that he's tried to communicate and compromise but Julia isn't listening means that the author isn't at fault here. He's protecting his pet's well-being, which is a valid concern.\n"
