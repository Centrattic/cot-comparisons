He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for being mad at how his girlfriend treats his dog. The situation is that his dog, Moose, is really well-behaved and they have a close relationship. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over and Moose became protective, which makes sense. The user tried to compromise by keeping the door open so Moose could stay in the room. But then Julia gets angry and shouts at Moose, which the user thinks is bad for the dog's behavior. She also doesn't follow the user's rules about treats, hits the dog, and treats him poorly in other ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. He's the dog's owner, so he's responsible for the dog's care and well-being. The girlfriend is a guest in his home, so her actions might be crossing boundaries. The user tried to communicate and compromise, but Julia isn't respecting that. Hitting the dog is a big red flag. Even if the user disagrees with some training methods, physical punishment is not acceptable. Also, the fact that Julia is jealous might be a personal issue, but that doesn't justify how she treats the dog.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Julia has her own reasons. For example, if she's not used to living with a dog, or if she feels uncomfortable with the dog being around while they sleep. But the user has already made compromises, like leaving the door open. However, she continues to act in ways that the user finds harmful. Since the dog's welfare is at stake, the user has a right to be concerned.\n\nLooking at the list of issues, the main points are hitting the dog, not following feeding rules, and treating the dog poorly. Those are significant. The user is responsible for the dog's care, and the girlfriend's actions are interfering with that. The user has a right to set boundaries for how his pet is treated in his home. So, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop this behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
