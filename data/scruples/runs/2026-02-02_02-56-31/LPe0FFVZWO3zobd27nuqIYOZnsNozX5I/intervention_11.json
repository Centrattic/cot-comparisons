  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for being mad at how my girlfriend treats my dog?\nI (21m) and my St Bernard, Moose (3m) have a super close relationship. He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog. He's had Moose since he was three months old, so they're really close. The girlfriend, Julia, is new to the situation and has been doing things like shouting at the dog, not giving treats, smacking him, etc. The user is clearly frustrated.\n\nFirst, the user explains that Moose is well-behaved and they have a good bond. When Julia started coming over, the dog became protective, which makes sense. Then there's the issue of Julia shouting at Moose when he's in the room, which the user finds stressful for the dog. They tried a compromise with the door open, but problems continued. Julia's actions like smacking the dog and not giving treats are red flags here. The user has a point about his dog's well-being and his own emotional attachment to Moose.\n\nThe user lists eight specific issues, which show a pattern of negative behavior towards the dog. The girlfriend's jealousy is mentioned, but that's not a valid reason to mistreat an animal. The user is firm on not wanting physical punishment for Moose, which is correct. Also, the user is the owner, so he should have the final say on how his pet is treated. The fact that Julia is living with her parents and visiting his place means she's a guest, so her actions in his home are under his rules. \n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe Julia's actions come from a place of concern about the dog's size or behavior, but that's not an excuse for shouting or smacking. Also, if the user hasn't set clear boundaries from the start, maybe he's partly responsible. However, the user has tried to communicate and compromise, like leaving the door open. The girlfriend isn't respecting those agreements. \n\nIn terms of animal welfare, smacking the dog is definitely unacceptable. The user's priority is his dog's emotional and physical well-being, which is valid. The girlfriend's jealousy and dislike of the dog could indicate deeper issues in the relationship. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. The key points are the mistreatment of the pet and the communication breakdown. The answer should be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
