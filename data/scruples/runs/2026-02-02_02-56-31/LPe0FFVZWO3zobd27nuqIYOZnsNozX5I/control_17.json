He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding his girlfriend's treatment of his dog. The author has a St Bernard named Moose, which he's had since it was a puppy. They have a good relationship, and the dog is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over since they started dating four months ago. The author is upset because Julia is being hostile towards the dog. She's shouted at the dog, made it sleep in the kitchen, smacked it, ignores it, etc. The author is considering telling her to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The dog is part of the household, and the author is the owner. Julia is a guest in his home. The main issue is her treatment of the dog. Shouting, smacking, not feeding properly\u2014these are all things that could be harmful or stressful for the dog. The author is the one responsible for the dog's well-being, so he has the right to set boundaries about how others interact with his pet.\n\nJulia's actions might stem from jealousy, but that doesn't justify her behavior. The author has already tried to compromise by leaving the door open. However, she's continued to be unkind to the dog. The author's concern is valid because the dog's emotional and physical health are at stake. The author is not obligated to let someone else treat his pet poorly, even if they're in a relationship. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe Julia feels that the dog is getting too much attention, but that's not a valid reason to mistreat it. The author is clear that he's affectionate with both Julia and the dog and that the dog's behavior is well-mannered. Julia's actions, like withholding treats and feeding less, could affect the dog's health. Smacking the dog is abusive and should not be tolerated. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. He has every right to be upset and to address the situation. The key points are his responsibility as the dog's owner and Julia's failure to respect that. The author isn't doing anything wrong by wanting to protect his pet from someone who's harming it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
