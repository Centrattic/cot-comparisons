He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is upset because their girlfriend is treating their dog poorly. The girlfriend is yelling at the dog, not giving treats, smacking it, and keeping it in the kitchen. The author has explained to the girlfriend that the dog is a big part of their life and that they want him to be comfortable. They've tried compromises, but the girlfriend isn't respecting their boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is the dog's owner and has been living with it for three months. The dog is well-behaved, which is a positive. The girlfriend has been with them for four months and spends time at the author's place, which is where the dog lives. The girlfriend's actions include yelling, physical punishment, and not following the owner's wishes regarding the dog's care. The author has tried to set boundaries, like keeping the door open so the dog can come back, but the girlfriend continues to act in ways the author finds unacceptable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is clearly standing up for their pet, which is their responsibility. The girlfriend's actions include physical punishment (smacking), which is a red flag because positive reinforcement is generally recommended in dog training. The girlfriend's jealousy and the way she's handling the dog (not giving treats, keeping it in the kitchen despite the cold) show a lack of respect for the owner's wishes and the dog's well-being.\n\nThe author has tried to communicate and compromise, but the girlfriend isn't listening. The author's response to ask her to ignore the dog if she can't be nice makes sense because they can't control her actions if she's in their home. The fact that the girlfriend has other dogs at her parents' house that she loves but dislikes this one might add context, but it doesn't excuse her behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer would be no. The author is protecting their pet and setting boundaries. The girlfriend's actions are problematic, and the author isn't doing anything wrong by addressing the issue and wanting to stop the mistreatment. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
