He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author has a close relationship with his dog, Moose. The girlfriend, Julia, started visiting and has several issues with the dog. She doesn't like the dog sleeping in the room, shouts at him, wants him off the sofas, refuses treats, smacks him, etc. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and how Julia's behavior might affect Moose negatively. He's tried compromises but Julia isn't listening.\n\nNow, the key points are about the treatment of the dog. The author is the dog's owner and has been with Moose for three months. Julia is a new partner who doesn't live there. She's imposing her preferences on the dog's treatment. Smacking the dog and shouting are forms of physical and verbal abuse, which are generally considered wrong. The author is against physical punishment and has taken steps to prevent Julia from feeding the dog because of her approach. \n\nJulia's actions, like smacking the dog and not giving treats, could be seen as harmful. The author's concern for the dog's emotional state and well-being is valid. The fact that Julia is new to the relationship and Moose's routine is being disrupted without consideration might also be a problem. \n\nThe author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. He's made compromises, like keeping the door open, but Julia isn't following through. The list of offenses she commits against the dog is extensive. From an ethical standpoint, physically punishing a pet is not acceptable, and the author has a responsibility to protect his dog. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his dog's welfare against a partner who isn't respecting the dog's needs. The answer should be B (No).\n"
