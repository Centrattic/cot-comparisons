  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for being mad at how my girlfriend treats my dog?\nI (21m) and my St Bernard, Moose (3m) have a super close relationship. He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset with how their girlfriend treats their dog, Moose. The situation involves several specific grievances.\n\nFirst, the user has a close bond with their dog, which is clear. Moose is well-behaved and has been living with the user since he was a puppy. The girlfriend, Julia, lives with her parents, so they spend time at his place. The main issues start when Moose isn't allowed to sleep in the room when they're sleeping, and Julia has been treating Moose poorly in various ways\u2014like not giving treats, smacking him, ignoring him, etc.\n\nThe user tried to compromise by leaving the door open, but problems continued. The girlfriend's actions include verbal outbursts, physical punishment, and not following the user's instructions regarding the dog's care. The user is now considering telling her to stop these behaviors.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The dog is the user's responsibility. The girlfriend is a guest in the user's home. The user has set boundaries about how the dog should be treated. The girlfriend is not a co-owner of the dog, so her input on his care isn't binding. However, the user is in a relationship, so there's a balance between respecting their partner and protecting their pet.\n\nThe key points are: the girlfriend is violating the user's established care routines, using harsh methods the user disagrees with, and not respecting the dog's training. The user has communicated their concerns, but she's not listening. The user's concern is valid because the dog's well-being is at stake. The girlfriend's jealousy and negative behavior could be signs of deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the user has the right to protect their pet, especially since the dog is their responsibility. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping, given that she doesn't live there and isn't a co-owner. However, the user should also consider whether there's a way to resolve this without confrontation, but since the user has already tried compromise and it's not working, taking a firm stand is reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the user is not in the wrong). The user is justified in being upset and taking action to protect their dog.\n"
