He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a guy who's upset because his girlfriend is treating his dog poorly. He lists several issues: she shouts at the dog, doesn't give treats, smacks the dog, wants the dog to sleep in the kitchen, etc. The author is frustrated and wants to know if he's in the wrong for being mad about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The dog is his pet, and he's the one who's been taking care of it. The girlfriend is coming into his home and treating the dog in ways he disagrees with. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and the girlfriend's behavior. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions include physical punishment (smacking), which the author is against, and other forms of mistreatment. The author has tried to compromise but the girlfriend hasn't respected those boundaries. The dog's behavior is a concern here, especially since the author has a strong bond with Moose.\n\nFrom an animal welfare standpoint, any form of physical punishment like smacking is generally discouraged. It can be harmful and stressful for the dog. Also, the author's request for the girlfriend to not shout at the dog and to respect his rules about the dog's treatment is reasonable. The girlfriend isn't living in his home, so she should respect his house rules. \n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy is another factor. She expresses jealousy towards the attention the dog gets, but that doesn't justify her behavior towards the dog. The author is providing affection to both his girlfriend and his dog, so her jealousy might be personal rather than about the dog's welfare.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend is violating his established boundaries regarding the dog's care. The author has a right to be upset if someone is mistreating his pet, especially since it's his responsibility to care for the dog. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting these boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has her own feelings and is trying to cope with jealousy. However, her actions are objectively harmful and disrespectful to the dog, which the author is responsible for. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect his pet and enforce his house rules. The girlfriend should respect his home and his decisions about how his pet is treated.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior crosses lines that he's set, and he's justified in being upset and wanting to address the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
