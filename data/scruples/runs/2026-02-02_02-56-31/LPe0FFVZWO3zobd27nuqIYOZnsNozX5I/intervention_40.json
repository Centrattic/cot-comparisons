  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for being mad at how my girlfriend treats my dog?\nI (21m) and my St Bernard, Moose (3m) have a super close relationship. He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user has a close relationship with his dog, Moose. They've been living together for some time, and the dog is well-behaved. Now that his girlfriend, Julia, is involved, there are issues. The main points are:\n\n1. Julia doesn't like Moose sleeping in the room, shouted at him, and tried to keep him out. The user compromised by leaving the door open.\n2. Julia is mean to Moose in other ways: wants him off the sofa, doesn't give treats, smacked him twice, and is jealous of the attention the dog gets.\n3. The user lists several specific grievances against Julia's treatment of the dog.\n\nNow, the user is wondering if he's in the wrong if he tells Julia to stop. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider if the user's reaction is justified. The user is the dog's owner, so he's responsible for the dog's well-being. Julia's actions could be harmful. Smacking the dog is a red flag, as physical punishment is often discouraged. Also, withholding treats and restricting access to the sofa without consent might be overstepping. \n\nThe user tried to compromise but Julia isn't respecting his boundaries. The key here is that the user is prioritizing his dog's emotional and physical health. If Julia isn't respecting the household rules regarding the dog, that's a problem in the relationship. The user isn't being unreasonable by standing his ground to protect the dog. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). The user is justified in being upset because Julia's behavior is harmful and disregards the agreed-upon rules. The dog's well-being is a priority, and the girlfriend isn't respecting that. He's not the one at fault here.\n"
