Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about an airport incident where an older woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it but then uses earbuds to make a phone call. The woman interrupts and asks him to be quiet. The author responds politely but then later plays a music video full volume on his iPad, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, public spaces often have rules about noise. Using earbuds for a phone call is generally acceptable, but the woman was using her device without headphones, which is considered impolite in public. The author's response to her complaint by playing loud music seems like a tit-for-tat retaliation. While the woman was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's action of playing loud music also disrupts others. However, since the woman was the initial offender, the author's action might be seen as a justified reaction to her behavior. But playing loud music isn't a good solution either. The author's action could be seen as escalating the conflict rather than resolving it. But considering the woman was the first to cause the disturbance, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, both actions contribute to the problem. The key is whether the author's response was appropriate. Since the woman was already being rude, the author's retaliation might be seen as a way to enforce mutual respect, but it's still disruptive. Public places require consideration for others, so both have issues. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The woman's behavior started the issue, but the author's response of playing loud music is also inappropriate. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because both are at fault, but the author's response was equally rude. Alternatively, if the woman was the main issue, maybe B (No). But the author's action was a direct response to her, so maybe the author is in the wrong. Hmm. I think both are wrong, but since the question is only about the author, maybe the answer is A because the author's retaliation is also wrong. But the woman was the initial problem. Wait, but the author's response is a direct consequence of her action. If the author played loud music, even if in retaliation, it's still impolite. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
