Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were wrong in their situation. So, the scenario is about an airport where an older lady sits next to them, watches a show loudly on her iPad. The user ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then when they make a phone call, the lady tells them to be quiet. The user responds by pointing out her loudness, and then as a joke, they play a video at full volume, leading her to leave in a huff.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether the user was in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, the lady was indeed being loud. In public spaces, using devices without headphones is generally considered rude. So the user's initial reaction to put in earbuds makes sense. Then, when the lady interrupts them, the user responds by pointing out her behavior. That seems fair\u2014addressing the issue politely. But then the user goes further by playing a loud video as a form of retaliation. That's where it might get tricky. Even if the lady was in the wrong, the user's response of matching her behavior could be seen as escalating the situation. While it's a form of \"taste of her own medicine,\" it might not be the best approach. Public settings require some level of decorum, and even if someone is wrong, responding with the same rude behavior could make the user at fault. So, the user's action of playing loud music after the argument might cross into being rude themselves. The initial response was reasonable, but the retaliation might not be. So the answer might be A, they are in the wrong because of their final action.\n"
