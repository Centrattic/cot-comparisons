Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author puts in earbuds and then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts the call to ask to speak quietly. The author responds politely but points out that her volume is rude. Then the lady claims she has every right, and the author sarcastically complies by playing a loud music video, causing her to storm off.\n\nHmm. First, the lady was being inconsiderate by watching her show loudly. Public spaces usually expect people to use headphones, so her action was rude. The author's initial response was to put on earbuds, which is a reasonable way to avoid disturbance. Then when the lady interrupts the call, the author defends themselves, which is understandable because the lady's behavior was the root problem.\n\nBut then the author takes it a step further by playing the music video loudly. While the lady started the problem, the author's retaliation might cross the line. Even though it's a form of giving her a taste of her own medicine, it's not a mature or effective way to handle the situation. The author could have just continued using earbuds and ignored the interruption. By reacting in kind, the author's action is equally rude, even if it's a response to the lady's behavior. So, the author's action was inappropriate, making them at least partially responsible. So the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
