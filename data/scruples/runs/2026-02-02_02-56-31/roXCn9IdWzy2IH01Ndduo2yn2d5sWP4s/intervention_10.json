Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in a situation where they retaliated against a woman who was being loud on her iPad at the airport.\n\nFirst, the context: the woman was watching a show loudly. The user initially ignored it by using earbuds. Then, when the woman complained about the user's phone call, the user pointed out her loud behavior. She responded by accusing him of being rude. In retaliation, the user played a music video full volume, causing her to leave in anger.\n\nNow, the key points. Public spaces often have unspoken rules about noise. Using headphones is a common way to respect others. The user's initial action (using earbuds) was reasonable. However, when the woman complained, the user's response was to escalate the situation by playing loud music. Even though the user was defending their own actions, the retaliation was not appropriate. Retaliation with the same behavior (loud noise) is not a valid response, as it disrupts others. The user could have resolved the situation by calmly explaining the issue without reciprocating the noise. Therefore, by taking the same disruptive action, the user contributed to the escalation and was in the wrong.\n"
