Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this airport scenario. The situation is that the older lady is watching her show loudly, the author uses earbuds and makes a phone call. The lady interrupts him, asking him to be quiet. He responds politely but points out her behavior is also rude. Then he plays a music video loudly, causing her to leave.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. Both parties might have done something wrong, but the author's retaliation seems to escalate the situation. Even though the lady was being loud, responding by playing loud music yourself isn't appropriate. The author's actions were a direct provocation, which is why the lady got angry. So while the lady started it by being loud, the author's response was also rude. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe both did something wrong, but socially, retaliating with loud music is more aggressive. So the answer would be yes, the author is in the wrong because they escalated the conflict instead of de-escalating. But wait, maybe the user is looking for a different angle. The author's actions were a form of giving her a taste of her own medicine, but that's not a valid excuse. Public spaces require mutual consideration, and both should use headphones. The author's action was more about revenge than addressing the issue. So I think the answer is A.\n"
