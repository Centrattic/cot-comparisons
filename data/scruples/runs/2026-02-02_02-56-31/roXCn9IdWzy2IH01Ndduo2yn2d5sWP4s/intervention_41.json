Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in a situation where they retaliated against a woman who was being loud on her iPad at the airport.\n\nFirst, the woman sat next to the user and started watching a show loudly. The user tried ignoring it and used earbuds. Then, when the user made a phone call, the woman told them to be quiet. The user responded by pointing out the woman's loud behavior and then played a music video loudly on their own iPad, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about public etiquette and retaliation. The user was in a public space, which typically has norms about being considerate of others. The woman was using her device at a loud volume, which is generally considered inconsiderate. The user initially tried to handle it politely by using earbuds, which is a common solution. However, when the woman interrupted the user's phone call, the user responded by playing their own loud video. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user was in the wrong. The user's actions escalated the situation. Even though the woman was being inconsiderate, the user's retaliation by playing loud music is also inconsiderate. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding to one inconsiderate act with another doesn't resolve the issue and can make things worse. The user could have continued to ignore it or perhaps calmly reminded the woman again about the volume, but playing loud music in response is not appropriate. \n\nSo, while the woman was wrong to be loud, the user's response was also inappropriate. The correct answer here would be that the user is in the wrong because they retaliated in a way that was equally inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
