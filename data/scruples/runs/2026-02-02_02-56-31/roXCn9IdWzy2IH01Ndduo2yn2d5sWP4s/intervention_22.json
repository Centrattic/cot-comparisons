Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in an airport incident where they retaliated against a woman who was being loud. The situation started with the woman watching a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The user initially ignored it but then made a phone call using earbuds. The woman complained, and the user responded by pointing out the hypocrisy and then played a music video loudly on their own device, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman was indeed being disruptive by not using headphones in a public space. The user tried to address this politely, pointing out the mutual hypocrisy. However, when the user decided to play their own loud video, that's where the conflict escalated. While the user's initial response was to highlight the issue, their retaliation by being loud themselves crosses a line. Even if the woman was at fault, responding with the same behavior doesn't resolve the issue and can be seen as equally disruptive. The user's action of playing loud music without headphones is a direct violation of the same rules they were criticizing. So, while the woman started the problem, the user's response was not appropriate. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because they chose to retaliate in a similar manner, which is not a constructive solution and escalates the tension unnecessarily.\n"
