Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for playing a music video loudly in response to a woman watching a show on her iPad at full volume.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman was being disruptive by not using headphones. The user tried to politely point out her behavior, but then escalated by playing a video loudly. The woman left angry. \n\nThe user's defense is that they were just giving her a taste of her own behavior. But in public spaces, there are norms about being considerate. The woman was clearly violating that by not using headphones. The user's initial reaction was to use earbuds and make a call, which is more acceptable if done quietly. \n\nHowever, when the woman complained, the user's response was to play a loud video. Even if it's a form of payback, it's still a violation of public decorum. Both parties were being disruptive, but the user escalated the situation. \n\nWhile the woman was in the wrong first, the user's response was also inappropriate. The correct approach would be to address the issue politely without retaliating in the same manner. So, the user is in the wrong for escalating the conflict with their own disruptive behavior.\n"
