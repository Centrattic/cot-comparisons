Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were wrong in this situation where they retaliated against a woman who was being loud on her iPad. So the woman was watching a show loudly at the airport, and the user tried to ignore her by putting in earbuds. Then when the user made a phone call, she complained about the volume. The user then told her that she was being rude and should use headphones. Then the user took it a step further by playing a music video loudly on their iPad to \"get back\" at her. The woman then left in a huff.\n\nHmm. The user's question is whether they were in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). So first, I need to analyze both sides.\n\nThe woman was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones in a public space. That's a common courtesy in places like airports where people are trying to work, read, or rest. So she was at fault first. The user tried to ignore her and then used earbuds to block out the noise, which is reasonable. Then when the user made a phone call, which is normal, the woman complained. The user responded by pointing out her own inconsiderate behavior, which is fair. But then the user escalated the situation by playing loud music themselves as retaliation. That's where it gets tricky. \n\nWhile the woman was wrong initially, retaliating with the same behavior might not be the best approach. The user's action of playing loud music full volume could be seen as equally inconsiderate, especially because they were in a public space. Even though it's a form of \"you do that, so will I,\" it's not necessarily justified. Public spaces require a certain level of decorum, and both parties should aim to be respectful without escalating the conflict. The user could have addressed the issue without mirroring the loud behavior. Instead, they chose to give her a taste of her own medicine, which might have been more disruptive than necessary. \n\nSo, while the woman was clearly at fault first, the user's response, though perhaps humorous or satisfying, could be seen as equally inconsiderate. The user's action might have crossed a line, even if their intention was to teach a lesson. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for responding with the same behavior in a public setting.\n"
