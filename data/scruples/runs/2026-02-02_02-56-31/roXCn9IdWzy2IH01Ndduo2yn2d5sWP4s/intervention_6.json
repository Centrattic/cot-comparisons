Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is at the airport. An older lady sits next to them and watches a show on her iPad loudly. The person initially ignores it and puts on earbuds. Then they make a phone call, and the lady interrupts them, asking them to talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nThe person responds by saying that actually, the lady is being rude by not using headphones, and that phone calls aren't the issue. The lady then says she has the right to enjoy her show. The person then agrees they're wrong and proceeds to play a music video full volume, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about public behavior and mutual respect. The lady was using her device without headphones, which is indeed disruptive in a public space. The person's initial response was to point out the lady's behavior, which might be justified since loud devices can affect others. However, when the lady asked them to quiet their phone call, the person could have either complied or explained why their own actions were acceptable.\n\nBut then, the person decides to play a music video full volume in response. That seems like a direct retaliation. Even if the lady was being rude, responding in kind might escalate the situation. The person's action of playing loud music without headphones is also disruptive and could be seen as equally rude. So while the lady was in the wrong initially, the person's retaliation might not be justified. Retaliation with similar behavior can create a cycle of escalation and isn't a mature way to resolve conflicts. The person could have chosen a different method to address the situation, like calmly reiterating the issue without acting out. Therefore, even if the lady was wrong first, the person's actions in response might still be considered in the wrong because they chose to act out instead of maintaining composure and resolving it respectfully.\n"
