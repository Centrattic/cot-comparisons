Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing in this airport situation. The scenario is that an older lady was watching a show loudly next to the person, who then put on earbuds. Then the person had a phone call, and the lady complained. The person responded by pointing out the lady's loudness, and then retaliated by playing a music video at full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The lady was indeed being rude by not using headphones, but when she complained, the author responded in kind by playing loud music. \n\nEven though the lady started it, the author's retaliation escalated the situation. Public spaces often have unspoken rules about not disturbing others, and while the lady broke that, the author's response of playing loud music without headphones was also a violation. \n\nSometimes, people might argue that the author was just giving her own medicine, but that doesn't make it right. The appropriate response would have been to calmly address the issue without reciprocating the rude behavior. The author's action could be seen as equally rude, so they might be at fault here.\n"
