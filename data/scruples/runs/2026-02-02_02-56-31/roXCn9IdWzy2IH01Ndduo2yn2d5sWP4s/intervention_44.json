Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they were wrong in a situation where they retaliated against a woman who was watching a show loudly in an airport. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the woman sat next to them and used her iPad without headphones, making noise. The user put in earbuds and ignored it. Then, the user made a phone call. The woman interrupted them to tell them to be quiet. The user politely explained that the woman's loud show was the real issue and that using headphones is normal. The woman insisted she had the right to do so. Then, the user took out their own iPad, played a music video full volume, and caused the woman to storm off.\n\nHmm. The user's actions escalated the situation. While the initial issue was the woman's loud TV, the user's response was to mirror her behavior. But in public spaces, there are usually rules against loud noise. However, the user's retaliation might be seen as equally rude. Even if the woman was in the wrong first, retaliating by being loud yourself can be seen as unkind and just as disruptive. The user's actions could be viewed as inappropriate because they took the conflict from a verbal to a physical action, which might have been unnecessary. Even if the woman started it, the user's response might not be the right approach. So, the answer would be that the user is in the wrong for escalating the situation by playing loud music in response.\n"
