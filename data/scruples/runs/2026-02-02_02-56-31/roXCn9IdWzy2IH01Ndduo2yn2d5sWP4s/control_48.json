Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The author responds politely but points out that her actions are also rude. He then sarcastically complies by playing a loud music video on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here: both parties are in a public space, and both are using electronic devices in a way that could be considered disruptive. The author's actions escalate the situation by retaliating in kind. Even though he was initially polite, his response of playing a loud music video after agreeing to her criticism seems like a direct provocation. \n\nLegally and ethically, public spaces do have some noise considerations. While the lady was indeed being loud, the author's retaliation might not be justified. It's possible that both acted inappropriately, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The author's action of playing loud music after agreeing to her point was intentional and meant to get back at her, which is probably not the right approach. Even if the lady was wrong, the author's method of responding by matching her behavior could be seen as equally rude or worse. \n\nSo, considering that, the author's retaliation is likely in the wrong because he escalated the conflict instead of de-escalating it. The answer would be A.\n"
