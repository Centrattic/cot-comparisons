Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at an airport, an older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author uses earbuds and then makes a call, which the lady interrupts. The author responds by telling her that loud shows are actually rude, then when the lady says the author is being rude, the author concedes and then plays a music video full volume, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The lady was indeed in a public space and using her device loudly, which is generally considered rude because it affects others. The author initially tried to ignore it and used earbuds, which is a reasonable approach. Then when the lady interrupts the author's call, the author points out the lady's behavior, which is fair because loud devices are expected to be avoided in public. However, the author then plays a music video full volume, which is a direct retaliation. \n\nNow, the key is whether the author's response was appropriate. The lady's actions were rude, but the author's retaliation might be seen as escalating the situation. Even though the author had a point about the lady's behavior, responding with similar behavior (loud music) could be considered wrong because it's a form of tit-for-tat that doesn't resolve the issue and instead creates more conflict. \n\nAlso, the author's initial point about phone calls being less rude might hold, but in reality, both parties might have had valid points. However, the author's final action of playing loud music was a deliberate act to show the lady her own behavior, which could be seen as justified in a way, but it's still disruptive. Public spaces require mutual respect, so while the author had a reason to be upset, reacting with the same behavior might not be the right approach. \n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A, then it's yes, the author is in the wrong. If it's B, then no. The author's retaliation, even if in response to rudeness, might be considered equally rude. So the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they escalated the conflict instead of de-escalating it. Therefore, the answer might be A. But some might argue that the author was just showing the lady her own wrong, which could be a defense. However, generally, public behavior should aim to resolve conflicts politely, not retaliate. So the answer could be A.\n"
