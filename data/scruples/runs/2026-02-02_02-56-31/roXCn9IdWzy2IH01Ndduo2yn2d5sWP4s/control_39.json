Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author puts in earbuds, then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts the call, asking him to be quiet. He responds by telling her that her behavior is actually rude and then plays a music video full volume, leading her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman was using her iPad loudly in a public space. Public places often have etiquette about using headphones to avoid disturbing others. So her action might be considered rude. The author tried to ignore it first, then when confronted, he argues back. But then he escalates by playing a video loudly. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual rudeness. The woman was being inconsiderate by not using headphones. The author, however, responded by playing something loud in retaliation. While the woman was wrong for not using headphones, the author's response was to mirror her behavior. Retaliation can be seen as equally rude, even if the initial action was wrong. \n\nSo even though the woman was at fault first, the author's action of playing the video full volume is also rude and inconsiderate. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he escalated the situation instead of de-escalating it. Both were being rude, but the author's response was a direct provocation.\n"
