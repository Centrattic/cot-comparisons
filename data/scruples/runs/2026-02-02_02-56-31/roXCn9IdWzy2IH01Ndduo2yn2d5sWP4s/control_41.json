Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an airport setting where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially puts in earbuds but then makes a phone call, which the woman interrupts, asking him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the woman's loud behavior and then retaliates by playing a music video at full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman was using her device without headphones, which is indeed inconsiderate in a public space. The author tried to ignore her at first, which is a reasonable approach. When the woman interrupted his phone call, the author responded politely but pointed out her inconsiderate behavior. However, the key issue here is the author's retaliation by playing a loud music video. While he was correct in pointing out her mistake, his response escalated the situation unnecessarily. Retaliation with loud noise mirrors the woman's original behavior, making it equally inconsiderate. In public spaces, both parties should aim to resolve conflicts without escalating them. The author's action, while perhaps a form of getting back at the woman, was a poor response and contributed to her anger. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not de-escalating the situation and for retaliating with his own loud behavior.\n"
