Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So, the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching her iPad show loudly. The author initially ignores her, puts in earbuds, and then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts him to ask him to be quiet. The author responds politely, points out her loudness, and then decides to play a music video full volume on his own device, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The lady was indeed being rude by playing her show loud without headphones. The author made a valid point there. However, when she asked him to lower his phone call, he did so politely. Then, he took it a step further by retaliating with his own loud actions. \n\nThe question is whether retaliation is acceptable. Even if someone is in the wrong, responding with the same or worse behavior might not be the right approach. The author could have continued to keep his phone call quiet or maybe asked her to lower her volume more firmly. Instead, he escalated the situation by playing a music video loudly. While his point about mutual respect might have some validity, the action of playing loud media in response is arguably rude and escalates the conflict unnecessarily. \n\nSo, even though the lady started it, the author's response crosses into being rude himself. Both parties have a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for retaliating in a way that's equally disruptive. The answer is A.\n"
