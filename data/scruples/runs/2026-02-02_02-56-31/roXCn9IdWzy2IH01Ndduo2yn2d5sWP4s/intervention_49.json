Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were wrong in a situation where they responded to a lady's loud iPad by playing a music video full volume. \n\nFirst, the woman was watching a show loudly on her iPad. The user initially tried to ignore it by using earbuds. Then, when the user made a phone call, the woman asked them to be quiet. The user responded by pointing out the woman's own loud behavior. When she insisted she had the right to do so, the user sarcastically agreed and then played a loud music video on their own device, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about mutual respect in public spaces. Both parties were using devices in a way that could be disruptive. The user's initial reaction was to use earbuds, which is a reasonable response. When the woman complained, the user pointed out her own behavior. But then, the user escalated the situation by playing loud music as a form of retaliation.\n\nI think the user's retaliation might be the problem here. Even though the woman was being loud, responding with the same behavior could be seen as equally inappropriate. The user's sarcastic agreement and then playing loud music might have crossed a line. The woman might have felt that both actions were rude, even if she started it. So, while the woman was at fault for not using headphones, the user's response was also unwise and could be considered wrong because it escalated the conflict and was a form of revenge, which isn't typically an acceptable response in public. The user should have perhaps continued to ignore it or politely reminded her again without retaliating.\n"
