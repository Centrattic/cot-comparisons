Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an airport. An older lady sits next to them and watches a show on her iPad loudly. The person initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when they make a phone call, the lady asks them to talk quietly because she's trying to watch her show. The person responds by pointing out that she's being rude by not using headphones and then proceeds to play a music video full volume on their own device, which causes the lady to storm off.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The lady was being loud on her device, which is generally considered impolite in public spaces. The person using earbuds is a good move to avoid disturbing others. When the lady interrupts the phone call, the person responds by pointing out her behavior. But then they escalate the situation by playing a loud video in retaliation.\n\nWait, so the person starts by being polite and then, when confronted, they mirror the lady's behavior. That's the crux. The initial act of the lady is rude, but the person's response\u2014while perhaps justified in pointing out the lady's rudeness\u2014takes it further by playing loud music themselves. Even if they were being sarcastic or pointing out the hypocrisy, actually making it worse by doing the same thing might be seen as inconsiderate. Because even if the lady started it, the person's action of playing loud music without headphones is also disruptive. So, even if they were trying to show her the same behavior, they ended up committing the same offense, which could make them at fault. So, in terms of airport etiquette, both parties were being inconsiderate, but the person's retaliation might be the worse action because they escalated the situation. Therefore, the answer would be A, since they did something equally rude in response.\n"
