Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong after a situation at the airport. The woman was using her iPad loudly, and when he made a phone call, she told him to be quiet. He responded by playing a loud music video on his iPad in retaliation.\n\nFirst, the initial issue: the woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed considered rude in public. The user didn't confront her at first, just put in earbuds. That's a reasonable response.\n\nThen, when he made a phone call and she asked him to be quiet, he pointed out her loud behavior. That part seems fair because he's pointing out her violation of social norms. However, his response of playing a loud music video is where it gets tricky. While she was wrong for using loud devices, his retaliation by doing the same thing might be seen as equally rude. Even if he's trying to show her the hypocrisy, it's a passive-aggressive response that could escalate the situation. The woman had a right to ask for quiet, but he also had a right to make his call. However, his action of playing loud music in response is likely to be seen as inconsiderate and possibly rude. So even though she was wrong, his reaction might have crossed a line, making him at least partially at fault. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his retaliation was inappropriate.\n"
