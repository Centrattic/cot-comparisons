Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves an airport situation where an older lady is watching a show loud on her iPad. The author initially ignores it, puts in earbuds, and then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts him to ask him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loud behavior and then retaliates by playing a music video loudly, causing her to leave.\n\nSo, first, the lady was indeed being rude by watching her show at full volume in a public area. Public spaces usually expect people to use headphones to avoid disturbing others. The author's initial response of putting in earbuds is a reasonable attempt to avoid conflict. When the lady interrupts him, he tries to reason with her politely, pointing out her own behavior. That seems fair; addressing the issue directly and respectfully is a good approach.\n\nBut then the author says he's wrong and proceeds to play a loud music video. This is where it gets tricky. Even though the lady was being rude, retaliating by playing loud videos is not a good strategy. It escalates the situation and turns the author into the same kind of person he accused her of being. While the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's response crosses a line. It's a form of revenge that's equally disruptive and unprofessional. The question is whether the ends justify the means. The author might feel justified, but in public settings, such retaliation can lead to more conflict and isn't a constructive solution. So, while the lady was wrong, the author's action wasn't appropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for responding in kind.\n"
