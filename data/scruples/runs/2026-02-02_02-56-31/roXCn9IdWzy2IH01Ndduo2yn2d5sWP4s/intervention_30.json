Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were wrong in the situation described. They were at the airport, and an older lady was watching a show loudly. He tried to ignore her at first, then put in earbuds. When he made a phone call, she asked him to quieten down. He responded that her behavior was rude, and then as a retaliation, he played a music video loudly, which caused her to leave in anger.\n\nFirst, the initial issue is about public etiquette. Generally, in public spaces like airports, people are expected to use headphones for audio devices to avoid disturbing others. So, the woman was indeed being considerate by wearing her earbuds and making a phone call, while the lady wasn't using headphones. But when he called her out, he was being polite, pointing out the hypocrisy. However, his response of playing the music video full volume seems to be a form of retaliation. Even though she was in the wrong, responding in kind by making it loud as well could escalate the situation unnecessarily. \n\nPublic spaces require mutual respect. While the older lady made a mistake by not using headphones, the user's action of playing a loud video could be seen as equally disruptive. He took her argument and used it against her, which might be fair in pointing out the inconsistency, but actually doing it might not be the best way to handle it. There's a difference between calling someone out and acting out a similar behavior. \n\nAlso, the user acknowledged he was polite in his initial response, but then escalated the situation by playing the music video. That action could be perceived as rude, even if it was a form of showing her the same behavior she was doing. So, while the woman was wrong, the user's response might not be the appropriate way to teach a lesson. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both parties made mistakes. The woman was wrong for not using headphones, and the user was wrong for retaliating in a disruptive manner. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether retaliation in this form is justified. Since he used her own argument against her by acting out the behavior she was criticizing, it's a form of hypocrisy, but the action itself is still disruptive. So technically, he did something wrong by responding in a similarly inconsiderate way. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
