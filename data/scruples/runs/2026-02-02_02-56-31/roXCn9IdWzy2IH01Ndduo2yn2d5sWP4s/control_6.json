Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break this down.\n\nSo the scenario is at an airport. An older lady sits next to the author and watches a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then the author makes a phone call, and the lady interrupts to ask them to be quiet. The author responds politely, pointing out that the lady's loud show is the real issue. The lady insists she's right, and the author then plays a music video full volume on their iPad, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nHmm. The key here is about public etiquette and mutual respect. Both parties are in a public space where noise can be an issue. The lady is definitely at fault for not using headphones, which is standard in places like airports. The author first tries to address it politely, which is reasonable. Then, when the lady accuses the author of being rude, the author retaliates by playing loud music. That seems like escalating the conflict. While the lady started it, the author's response of playing loud music is also rude and escalates the situation. So even though the lady was wrong, the author's action was also inappropriate. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they responded with the same behavior they were criticizing.\n"
