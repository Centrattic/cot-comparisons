Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation: an older lady is sitting next to the author at the airport, watching a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The author puts on earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the lady interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that her volume is the issue and that phone calls aren't inherently rude. The lady insists she's right, and the author then plays a music video full volume on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, both parties are in a public space where quiet is expected. The lady is using public space without headphones, which is indeed rude. The author, instead of escalating, initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when confronted during a call, he's polite but points out her mistake. But then he retaliates by playing loud music, which is a direct response to her actions.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the author's retaliation was justified. While it's true that the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's response of playing loud music is also rude and escalates the situation unnecessarily. Even if he felt the need to teach her a lesson, doing so by violating the same rule (loud audio in public) is hypocritical and doesn't resolve the issue constructively. The author could have calmly continued using his earbuds and ignored her further, rather than mirroring her behavior.\n\nSo, while the lady started the problem, the author's actions were equally inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his response was not a constructive solution but a passive-aggressive act that mirrored the problem.\n"
