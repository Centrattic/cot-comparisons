Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did something wrong by retaliating against a woman who was being loud on her iPad in an airport. \n\nFirst, the woman sat next to them and started watching a show loudly. The user tried to ignore it by putting in earbuds and even made a phone call. The woman then complained about the phone call, even though she was the one being loud.\n\nThe user responded by pointing out the hypocrisy and then played a music video loudly on their own device. The woman left angry. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Legally, in public places, there are usually rules about noise levels. The woman was violating that by not using headphones. The user's phone call might be within their rights, but when confronted, they escalated the situation by playing loud music. \n\nEven though the woman started it, retaliating in kind might not be the best approach. The user's action of playing loud music could be seen as equally rude, even if it was a form of paying her back. Public spaces require consideration for others, and both parties might have overstepped. However, the user's action was a direct response to the woman's behavior, which was the initial problem. \n\nSo, while the woman was at fault for being loud without headphones, the user's retaliation could be seen as equally inconsiderate. But the question is about whether the user is in the wrong. Since they took it upon themselves to respond in kind, maybe they did overstep, even if the woman was wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes, they are in the wrong) because their response was also inappropriate, even if provoked.\n"
