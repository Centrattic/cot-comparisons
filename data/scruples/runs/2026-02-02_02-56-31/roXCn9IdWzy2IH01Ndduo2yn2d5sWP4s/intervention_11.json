Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong when they retaliated against a woman who was being loud on her iPad at the airport.\n\nFirst, the woman was watching a show loudly. The user initially tried to ignore it by putting in earbuds. Then the user made a phone call, which the woman interrupted by asking to talk quietly. The user responded by pointing out her loudness and then, in a kind of sarcastic way, said they were wrong and played a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the user's retaliation was justified. The woman was being loud, which is rude in public. The user's initial reaction was to point out the issue politely. Then, after the woman accused the user of being rude, the user played a music video loudly as a form of retaliation. \n\nBut playing loud from your own device in public is also rude. Even if it's a response to someone else's loudness, it's not a good solution. The user escalated the situation instead of finding a more constructive way to resolve it. So, while the woman was in the wrong for being loud without headphones, the user's retaliation was equally rude and not appropriate. So the user is in the wrong because their action was not a proportionate or respectful response. They should have maybe continued to ignore it or politely asked her again to lower the volume instead of taking that action.\n"
