Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story was in the wrong when they responded to a lady watching a show loudly on her iPad.\n\nFirst, the woman in the story is in an airport, a public place. She notices the older lady using her iPad without headphones, which is disruptive. The writer initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when the woman makes a phone call, the older lady confronts her, saying the call is rude. The writer responds politely, pointing out the lady's own loud behavior. Then, to \"give her a taste of her own medicine,\" the writer plays a music video full volume, causing the other woman to leave in anger.\n\nNow, the key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The older lady is clearly in the wrong for using her device without headphones in a public space, which is disruptive. The writer is justifying their actions by pointing out the hypocrisy. However, the writer's retaliation by playing loud music without headphones is the same behavior they criticized. Even if the older lady was wrong, the writer's response is equally rude. So while the older lady started it, the writer's action is not justified. Both are wrong, but specifically, the writer is also wrong for retaliating in the same manner they condemned. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they responded with the same rude behavior.\n"
