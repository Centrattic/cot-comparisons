Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong in the airport incident.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman was watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignored it but put in earbuds. Then the woman asked the author to lower their phone call volume. The author responded politely but pointed out the woman's loud behavior. Then the author sarcastically played a loud music video to show the woman her own behavior. The woman got angry and left.\n\nSo, the key points here. The woman was being loud in public, which is generally considered rude. The author tried to address it politely. But then took a retaliatory action by playing loud music themselves. The question is whether the author was wrong in doing that.\n\nPublic spaces have norms about keeping noise down. The woman violated that by not using headphones. The author's initial response was to point this out, which is reasonable. However, the author escalated the situation by playing loud music as a lesson. While the author's action was a form of teaching the woman a lesson, it's a bit of a tit-for-tat approach. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, playing loud music in public is also a violation of the same norms the author was pointing out. The woman was wrong to be loud, but the author's response, while humorous, was equally rude. So both actions are against public behavior standards. However, the author's main point was to show the woman her mistake. \n\nThe problem here is that the author didn't just point out the issue but acted out the consequence. In doing so, they became the same as the woman. So, while the author had a valid point, their method was inappropriate because they used the same behavior they were criticizing. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for responding in kind, even if the woman was at fault. Public behavior should be maintained by all, so the author's action was also a violation.\n"
