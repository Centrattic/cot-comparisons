Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong when they retaliated against a woman's loud iPad in the airport.\n\nFirst, the woman was watching a show loudly, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The user initially tried to handle it by putting in earbuds and ignoring the noise, which is a reasonable first step. Then, when the user made a phone call, the woman complained. The user responded politely, pointing out that her loud show was the issue, which is valid because public spaces require consideration for others.\n\nThe key moment is when the user decided to play a loud music video on their iPad in response. Even though the user was upset, retaliating by playing loud media isn't appropriate. While the woman was clearly in the wrong for disrupting the user first, the user's response escalated the situation. Playing loud music in the same public space is equally inconsiderate and could be seen as just as rude. The user's action, even if meant as a joke or to show the woman her own behavior, crosses into being disrespectful and could harm others nearby who aren't involved in the conflict.\n\nSo, even if the user's intentions were to show the woman her mistake, the action was inappropriate. Both parties should use headphones in public, but retaliating with loud media isn't the solution. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for their response.\n"
