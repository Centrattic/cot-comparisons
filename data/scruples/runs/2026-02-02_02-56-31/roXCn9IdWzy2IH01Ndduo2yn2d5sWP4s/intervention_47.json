Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in a situation at the airport where they retaliated against a woman who was watching TV loudly. \n\nFirst, the woman sat next to them and played her show loudly. The user initially put on earbuds, which is a reasonable response to avoid disturbance. Then they made a phone call, which the woman interrupted, asking them to talk quietly. The user responded by pointing out that her loud TV was actually rude and that phone calls aren't as disruptive as loud devices.\n\nThe key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The woman was in the wrong for not using headphones, which is a common expectation in public places to avoid disturbing others. The user, when confronted, tried to explain this politely. However, the user then escalated the situation by playing a loud music video in retaliation. While the initial complaint was valid, the response of playing loud music is similarly disruptive and crosses the line. Retaliating with the same behavior doesn't resolve the issue and can be seen as equally rude. \n\nSo, even though the user had a valid reason to be upset, their action of playing loud video in response is not justified. Public spaces require consideration for others, and retaliation isn't a solution. Therefore, the user is at fault for their own disruptive behavior, even if their original complaint was valid.\n"
