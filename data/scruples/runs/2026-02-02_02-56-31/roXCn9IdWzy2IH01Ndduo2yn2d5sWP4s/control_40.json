Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly, and the author starts a phone call. The woman asks him to be quiet, and he responds by saying that her loud show is actually the rude behavior. Then he plays a music video full volume, causing her to leave in anger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether both parties acted appropriately. The woman started by watching her show loudly. In public places, especially airports, there are usually rules against loud audio because it affects others. So maybe she was in the wrong first by not using headphones. The author initially tried to ignore her by putting in earbuds. When she asked him to quiet his phone call, he responded by calling her out on her own behavior. \n\nBut when he decides to play the music video full volume, that's a direct retaliation. Even though he's pointing out her mistake, his action of playing loud audio is similar to hers but done intentionally as a lesson. So he's mirroring her behavior, but maybe crossing a line. \n\nIs there a difference between a phone call and media playback? Phone calls can be more intrusive because they involve two people talking, but media is passive. However, both can be disruptive if loud. The author might argue that the woman started it, but his response escalates the conflict. \n\nLegally, neither has a right to disturb others with loud noise. Airports often expect quiet environments. So both could be violating the same rules. But the author's retaliation was a direct and public humiliation, which might not be the appropriate way to handle a conflict. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's action was to give her a \"taste of her own behavior.\" While it's a form of poetic justice, it's also confrontational and could be seen as vengeful. The woman was already disruptive, but the author's response turned it into a public spectacle. \n\nSo, technically, both were wrong in their actions, but the author's retaliation was a deliberate and public act of revenge. Therefore, the author's action, while perhaps justified in pointing out the hypocrisy, was still inappropriate because it escalated the situation and caused someone else to leave angrily. The correct answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he should have addressed the issue without retaliating in kind.\n"
