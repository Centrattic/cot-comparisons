Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in an airport situation. The scenario involves an older woman watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the user responds by playing a music video full volume after a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the initial issue: the woman was being loud in a public space. Public places often have unspoken rules about noise levels. Using headphones is common to avoid disturbing others. So, the woman might be at fault for not using headphones.\n\nThe user tries to handle it politely by putting in earbuds and then making a call. When interrupted, they respond by explaining that the woman's behavior is rude. This seems reasonable because the user is asserting their right to not be disturbed. The woman then accuses the user of being rude, which is a bit ironic since she was the one being loud.\n\nThen the user plays a music video full volume, which is a direct retaliation. This is where it gets tricky. While the user was defending themselves from the initial disturbance, retaliating in kind could escalate the situation. Even if the user felt wronged, playing a loud video in return might not be the best approach. It's a tit-for-tat response that could be seen as equally rude, especially if it causes a scene or disturbs others nearby.\n\nPublic behavior standards usually encourage using headphones for media consumption. The user's action could be seen as a lesson, but it's also a public disturbance. The woman's reaction (storming off) might be because she felt embarrassed or that the user went too far. \n\nSo, while the woman started by not following social norms, the user's response might have crossed a line by creating a similar disturbance. The user's actions could be considered in the wrong because they didn't resolve the conflict in a constructive way and instead mirrored the problematic behavior, which might not be acceptable in a public space where such actions can affect others. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes, the user is in the wrong for retaliating in a way that also disrupts others.\n"
