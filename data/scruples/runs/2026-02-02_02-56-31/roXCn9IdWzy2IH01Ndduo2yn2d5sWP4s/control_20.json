Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for the situation described. So, first, I need to understand the scenario.\n\nThe person is at the airport, and a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the woman interrupts to tell the author to talk quietly. The author responds politely but points out that the woman is being rude by not using headphones. The woman insists she's right, and the author then plays a music video full volume on their own device, causing her to storm off. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The woman was using her device without headphones, which is a common issue in public spaces. The author uses earbuds but then makes a phone call, which can be disruptive. The woman's complaint is about the phone call being loud. The author responds by saying that the woman's behavior is actually rude, which is a valid point because public spaces usually require headphones for media. However, the author then retaliates by playing music loudly from their own device. This seems like an escalation.\n\nNow, the core of the issue is whether the author's response was appropriate. Retaliating by doing the same thing they accused the woman of doing could be seen as hypocritical. The author pointed out the woman's mistake correctly, but instead of just stopping their call or moving, they took it further by playing loud media. The woman had the right to ask for quiet, and while her volume was indeed rude, the author's retaliation might not be justified. Public spaces have rules for a reason, and both parties violated them. The author's action of playing loud music could be considered equally rude, so even if the woman was wrong, the author's response was not appropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation in a similar manner.\n"
