Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong in a situation where they retaliated against a woman who was watching a show loudly on her iPad in an airport. He first tried ignoring her by using earbuds, then when she complained about his phone call, he responded by playing a music video loudly, which made her leave.\n\nSo, the key points here: both were using their devices in a public space. The woman was watching a show at loud volume, which is generally considered impolite because it affects others. The user, when confronted, pointed out her behavior, which is fair because loud electronics in public areas are usually discouraged. However, his response was to play a music video full volume without earbuds, which is essentially doing the same thing he criticized her for.\n\nNow, the question is about whether he was in the wrong. The initial action of the woman was rude, so the user had a valid point there. But retaliation is tricky. Even if he's right about her being rude, responding in kind by playing loud music is a problem. It's a cycle where both parties are acting inconsiderately. The user's response isn't just pointing out her mistake; it's actively making the situation worse by mirroring her behavior. \n\nPublic spaces do have a social norm where people are expected to be considerate, which includes using headphones for audio. The woman violated that norm, and the user, instead of finding a middle ground (like asking her to lower the volume politely), chose to escalate. Even though he was defending what's right, the method he used was also violating the same social norms. \n\nSo, while the woman was in the wrong for not using headphones, the user's retaliation made him equally at fault. He could have handled it by calmly suggesting she use headphones next time without escalating. By playing loud music, he crossed the line into being rude as well. Therefore, he's in the wrong because his response was inappropriate even if his initial criticism was valid.\n"
