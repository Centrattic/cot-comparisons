Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they were wrong when they played a music video loudly at the airport after a woman complained about his phone call. \n\nFirst, the lady was watching her show on an iPad without headphones, which was disturbing others. The user initially put in earbuds to avoid the noise. Then, when she complained about his phone call, he pointed out her behavior as the real issue. She responded by defending her actions, and he then played a music video loudly to mirror her actions.\n\nNow, the key points here are about public etiquette and retaliation. The user's response was to give her a taste of her own behavior by playing something loudly. While the woman was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones, the user's retaliation could be seen as taking it too far. Even if her actions were rude, responding in kind with loud audio might escalate the situation and could be considered equally rude. The user's actions might not be in line with maintaining composure and resolving the conflict politely. So, while the woman was at fault initially, the user's response might have crossed a line, making him also at fault for not handling it more calmly.\n"
