Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong when they retaliated against a woman who was being loud on her iPad at the airport.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman sat next to them, played a show loudly. The user tried to be polite by putting in earbuds and ignoring it. Then the woman got annoyed when the user made a phone call and asked them to talk quieter. The user responded by pointing out the woman's own loud behavior and then, to \"give her a taste of her own medicine,\" played a music video at full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they were wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFrom a public behavior standpoint, both parties could be at fault. The woman was indeed being loud, which is generally frowned upon in public spaces. The user had the right to point out her behavior politely. However, the user's response of playing loud music in retaliation crosses a line. While the woman was in the wrong, retaliating in kind can escalate the situation and isn't considered a mature or respectful solution. It's a classic \"taste of their own medicine\" approach, which might feel satisfying but can lead to worse outcomes. Public spaces require mutual respect, so even if someone is rude, responding with similar rudeness isn't appropriate. The user could have continued to ignore the woman, maybe asked an airport staff member if necessary, but playing loud music in response is likely to be seen as equally inconsiderate or even more so, leading to conflict. So, the user's actions, while a form of revenge, are probably wrong because they don't model the respectful behavior they expected from the woman. Thus, the answer is A (I am in the wrong).\n"
