Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story did something wrong by retaliating against a woman who was watching a show loudly on her iPad at the airport. \n\nFirst, the setup: the woman sits next to the author, starts watching a show loudly. The author tries to ignore it and puts in earbuds. Then, the author makes a phone call and the woman interrupts them to ask to be quiet. The author responds politely but points out the woman's loud behavior as rude. The woman claims she has the right to enjoy her show. The author then plays a music video loud on their iPad, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider social norms and etiquette. In public spaces, it's generally expected that people use headphones to avoid disturbing others. The woman didn't do that, so her behavior was indeed rude. However, the author's response was to escalate the situation by playing loud music after agreeing that their phone call was rude. That seems like a vindictive act. Even though the author started with a valid point, retaliating in the same manner they were accused of might be seen as equally rude. \n\nBut wait, the author had just been told their phone call was rude. The phone call, while potentially disturbing others, might be considered less rude than playing music, which is continuous and possibly more disruptive. Also, the author had the chance to just ignore the situation but chose to engage and then retaliate. \n\nThe key point here is about proportionality and escalating conflict. Even if the initial behavior was wrong, responding with a similar or worse action isn't considered appropriate. The author's action of playing loud music after agreeing that their initial call was rude might be seen as hypocritical or excessive. \n\nBut then again, the woman was the one who started the disturbance. The author's defense was that the woman was rude first. However, in public etiquette, it's about not disturbing others. The author's retaliation could be seen as equally disturbing others, so they might be in the wrong for not maintaining their own restraint. \n\nSo, even though the woman was at fault for the initial behavior, the author's response might have been an overreaction. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation appropriately by retaliating instead of finding a peaceful resolution.\n"
