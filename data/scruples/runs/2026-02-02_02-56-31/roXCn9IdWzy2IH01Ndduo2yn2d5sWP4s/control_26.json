Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone in an airport who's dealing with a woman watching a show loudly. The author first ignores it by putting on earbuds. Then when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds politely but then plays an ice cubes music video full volume, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The woman was being loud, which is generally considered impolite in public spaces. The author tried to handle it calmly at first. But when the woman complained, the author responded by playing music loudly in retaliation. \n\nNow, while the woman was indeed being rude by not using headphones, the author's response might be over the line. Retaliation with the same behavior, even if it's a form of \"taste of their own medicine,\" can be problematic. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding in kind might escalate the situation. \n\nThe key here is that the author used a similar rude action back at the woman. Even if they thought they were justified, it's not a good approach. The proper thing would have been to either continue politely asking her to lower the volume or to report the issue to airport staff. Retaliating with loud music could be seen as equally rude and might lead to a worse outcome, like the woman getting angry and storming off, which could cause more disruption.\n\nSo, while the woman was initially wrong, the author's actions in response are also problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
