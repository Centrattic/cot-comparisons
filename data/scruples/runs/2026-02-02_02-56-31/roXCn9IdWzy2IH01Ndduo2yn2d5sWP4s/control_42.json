Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for responding to the older lady's loud iPad by playing a music video full volume.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The lady is in a public airport, watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her politely, pointing out her loud volume. The lady insists she's right. Then the author retaliates by playing a loud music video. The lady gets angry and leaves.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. Both parties were using electronic devices in a public space. The lady was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is generally considered rude. The author called her out politely, which is a reasonable response. But then the author escalated the situation by playing loud music in retaliation. That seems like the problem. Even though the lady was wrong, the author's response was to do the same, which is equally inconsiderate. Public spaces require everyone to be mindful, and retaliating with the same behavior doesn't solve the issue but just creates a cycle of rudeness. \n\nThe author might have been trying to show the lady her own mistake, but through a tit-for-tat approach. However, that's not the right way to handle it. The correct approach would be to continue using headphones or maybe report the behavior to airport staff. By playing loud music, the author is now being rude as well. So in this case, the author is in the wrong because their retaliation was inappropriate and escalated the conflict unnecessarily. Even if the lady was wrong first, the author's actions were not justified. So the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
