Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in this airport situation. So the scenario is: an older lady sits next to them, watches a show loudly on her iPad. The user puts on earbuds and ignores it. Then when they make a phone call, the lady asks them to be quieter. The user responds politely but points out that the lady's behavior is actually rude. Then they flip the script by playing a music video full volume on their iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who was right or wrong here. Both parties were using electronic devices in a public space. The lady was playing her show loudly, which is generally considered impolite because it affects others. The user then made a phone call, which is also a common activity but can be disruptive if not done quietly. However, phone calls require speaking aloud, so maybe that's less avoidable unless using a headset. \n\nWhen the lady asked the user to speak quietly, the user responded by pointing out that the lady's own behavior was the issue. The user then escalated the situation by playing music full volume on their iPad, which is the same thing the lady was doing. The user's action was a form of retaliation, but it's a public space, so both actions could be considered rude. However, the user's response was to mirror the lady's behavior, which led to her leaving in anger. \n\nLegally, in public places, there are usually rules about noise levels, but these are often enforced by staff, not individuals. The user's action of playing loud music might be against those rules, but it's not necessarily illegal. However, from a social etiquette standpoint, both the lady and the user were being inconsiderate. The user's retaliation might have been justified in their eyes because the lady started it, but causing someone to leave in anger isn't a good outcome. \n\nThe user could have handled it differently, like politely asking the lady to lower her volume first or moving to a different seat. Instead, they chose to escalate, which might have been a poor judgment call. Even if the user felt they were right, playing loud music in response is not a professional or mature way to handle a conflict. \n\nSo, while both parties were at fault for their initial actions (lady being loud, user being loud), the user's retaliation was a conscious choice that mirrored the lady's behavior. Therefore, the user might share some responsibility for escalating the situation. So the answer would be A (Yes, they are in the wrong) because they chose to retaliate in a way that's equally disruptive, even if they felt justified.\n"
