Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong when they played a music video loudly in response to a woman who was watching her show without headphones.\n\nFirst, the woman was loud on her iPad. The user initially tried to ignore her by using earbuds. Then, when the woman complained about the phone call, the user pointed out her loudness. She responded by saying she had the right to enjoy her show. The user then decided to play a music video loudly to mirror her behavior.\n\nSo, the key points are: mutual loudness. The user's actions were a direct response to the woman's. But in public spaces, there's an unspoken rule to be considerate. Both were being loud, but the user escalated it by playing a music video. Even though the woman started it, the user's retaliation might be seen as equally rude. However, the user's response was a form of giving her own behavior back, which is a common \"taste of their own medicine\" approach. \n\nBut legally and socially, is there a difference? Legally, people can use public spaces as they please unless it's a clear disturbance. But socially, both were inconsiderate. The user's action might be justified as a form of fairness, but it's still rude. So, the answer might hinge on social norms versus legal rights. Since the user's action was a direct retaliation, they might be in the wrong because they didn't maintain the initial polite stance after the argument. Instead of matching her rudeness, maybe they should have continued to ignore it or escalated to a staff member. Therefore, the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because both were rude, but the user's action was a direct provocation. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they were responding to the woman's initial rudeness. It's a bit of a toss-up, but since the user escalated the situation, maybe A is correct. Wait, but the woman also escalated by confronting the user first. However, the user's response was to mirror her behavior, which might be seen as equalizing the situation. So maybe B is correct because the user was showing the woman the consequences of her actions. Hmm. The question is about being in the wrong. If both were being loud, but the user's response was a direct consequence, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But public behavior standards usually frown on loudness regardless. So maybe the user is in the wrong for the same reason the woman was \u2014 being loud in public. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
