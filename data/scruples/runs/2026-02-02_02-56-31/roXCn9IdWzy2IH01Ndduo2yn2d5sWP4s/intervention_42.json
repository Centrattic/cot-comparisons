Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong in their actions. The situation involves an older woman watching a show on her iPad at an airport without headphones, which the user finds rude. The user then makes a phone call and is asked to be quiet. They respond by pointing out the woman's volume issue and then play a loud music video in response, leading her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the etiquette here. In public spaces, using headphones is generally expected to avoid disturbing others. The woman was indeed being rude by using loud volume without headphones. The user's initial reaction of ignoring and using earbuds is reasonable. However, when the woman interrupts, the user's response of pointing out her behavior is justified, but then escalating by playing loud music themselves crosses a line.\n\nThe key point is mutual respect. While the woman was in the wrong, the user's retaliation by playing loud music is also disruptive. Even if it's a form of \"giving her own medicine,\" it's still an action that affects others. The user's actions, while perhaps a form of payback, are equally rude. So, even though the woman started it, the user's response makes them equally at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A, they are in the wrong for escalating the situation with their own loud behavior.\n"
