Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict at an airport between two people regarding noise levels.\n\nFirst, the older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts and asks him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the inconsistency of her actions\u2014she's being loud while criticizing his phone call. Then, the author plays a music video full volume on his iPad, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here: both parties are in a public space where noise levels can be an issue. The lady is using her device without headphones, which is disruptive. The author, after being confronted, responds by doing the same, essentially giving her a taste of her own behavior. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and socially, public spaces often expect people to use headphones to avoid disturbing others. The lady's initial action was disruptive. However, the author's retaliation by playing music full volume might escalate the situation. While the author's response was a form of tit-for-tat, it's a direct reaction to being called rude. But the problem is that the author also used loud volume, which is the same behavior they were criticizing. \n\nSo even though the lady started it, the author's action of playing loud music is also against the social norm. Therefore, the author's retaliation makes them at least partially at fault. The appropriate response might have been to continue being polite, perhaps enforce the norm without reciprocating the noise. Since the author mirrored the lady's behavior, they share some responsibility. Hence, answer A (Yes) because the author's action was also inappropriate.\n"
