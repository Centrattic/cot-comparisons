Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this airport scenario. So, the situation is that an older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume after being told to be quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sequence of events. The lady sits next to the author, plays her show loudly. The author puts earbuds in but then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts the call to ask the author to talk quieter. The author, in a polite manner, points out that the lady's loud show is actually rude and that phone calls aren't the issue. Then, the lady insists she has the right, and the author sarcastically agrees and plays loud music in response. The lady gets angry and leaves.\n\nNow, the main question is about right and wrong. Public places usually require consideration for others. Both parties are using devices without headphones, which can be disruptive. The author's initial reaction was to use earbuds, which is correct. When the lady complaints, the author responds by pointing out the lady's own behavior, which is fair. However, the author's final action of playing loud music is a direct retaliation. Even though the author was responding to the lady's loudness, playing music full volume in a public space is also disruptive. So, even if it's a form of payback, it's still against the etiquette of public spaces. The author escalated the situation, leading to the lady leaving. While the lady started it, the author's response was not appropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for retaliating in a way that's equally rude. So the answer should be A.\n"
