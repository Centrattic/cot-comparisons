Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this scenario. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for responding to the woman's loud iPad by playing a music video full volume. \n\nFirst, the woman was watching a show loudly on her iPad in a public airport. The author initially tried to be polite by putting in earbuds. When the author made a phone call, the woman interrupted, asking him to speak quieter. The author responded that her loud show was actually the issue and that they should use headphones. The woman then claimed she had the right to enjoy her show. The author then retaliated by playing a music video full volume, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nNow, considering public etiquette: playing loud audio in public is generally considered rude. The woman's action of watching a show without headphones is the initial problem. The author's phone call is a reasonable use of their own device. However, when the author responded by playing loud music in retaliation, that's where it gets tricky. \n\nThe author's initial response was to point out the woman's behavior, which is valid. But then escalating by playing loud music might cross a line. Even though the woman started it, retaliating in kind could be seen as equally rude. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding with the same disruptive behavior doesn't solve the issue\u2014it just creates a cycle of rudeness. \n\nSo, while the woman was in the wrong first, the author's retaliation by playing loud music could be considered in the wrong as well. Both actions are disruptive, so technically, the author might be wrong for retaliating. But some might argue that it's a form of giving her own behavior back, which is a common trope in these \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios. However, legally and socially, both actions are problematic. The key is that retaliation isn't the solution; the right approach would have been to address the issue politely without reciprocating the noise. Therefore, the author's action is not justified, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
