Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author ignores it at first but then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts and asks him to quiet down. He responds by telling her that she's being rude, and then he plays a music video loudly, causing her to leave angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. Both parties were using electronic devices in a public space. The woman was using the iPad without headphones, making it audible to others. The author was on a phone call without headphones, which can also be disruptive. \n\nIn many public places, there are rules about using headphones to prevent disturbing others. If the author was on a call without headphones, that could be considered rude as well. However, the woman started by using the iPad loud, which was the initial issue. The author tried to reason with her politely, pointing out her behavior as rude. Then he escalated by playing music loudly, which is a direct retaliation.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were justified. While the woman was indeed being inconsiderate, the author's response of playing loud music in return seems like an escalation that was not necessary. Even though he was pointing out her mistake, retaliating in a similar manner might cross a line. Both parties have a responsibility to maintain a quiet environment. The author could have continued to use headphones and ignored the situation, but instead chose to mock her behavior, which led to a conflict. \n\nSo, while the woman was initially at fault, the author's response of playing music loudly might be seen as equally inconsiderate and a direct provocation. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for escalating the situation. However, some might argue that he was just showing her the consequences of her actions. But generally, public conduct guidelines encourage not retaliating but rather addressing the issue calmly or seeking help from airport staff if necessary. Hence, the author's actions could be considered wrong because they provoked a further conflict rather than resolving it peacefully.\n"
