Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for their actions in the airport situation. So first, the setup: an older woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad next to them. The user responds by making a phone call, which the woman interrupts, asking them to be quiet. The user then argues that the woman's loud TV is the real issue and then plays a music video loudly as a response, causing her to storm off.\n\nNow, the key points here. Public spaces usually have unspoken rules about noise. People are generally expected to use headphones or be considerate of others. The woman was watching her show at a high volume, which is considered rude in public. The user tried to address this politely, pointing out the hypocrisy. Then, when the woman continues to be rude, the user retaliates by playing their own loud video. \n\nThe user's actions here are a form of retaliation. While the woman was definitely in the wrong for being loud, the user's response might be seen as equally rude. Playing loud music in public is also against the norm. Even though it's a form of \"give and take,\" the user escalated the situation. Their initial response was to point out the issue, which is reasonable, but then they took it further by matching the woman's behavior. This could be seen as provoking her further instead of resolving the conflict. \n\nSo, while the woman started the problem, the user's actions might not be justified. The user could have chosen to ignore her after the initial confrontation or involve an airport staff member. Retaliation with loud music might be seen as equally disruptive. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for escalating the situation with their own loud behavior.\n"
