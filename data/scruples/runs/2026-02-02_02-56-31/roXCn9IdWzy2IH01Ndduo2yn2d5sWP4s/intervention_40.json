Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in an airport situation where they retaliated against a woman who was being loud. \n\nFirst, the woman sits next to them and watches a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The user initially ignores it by putting on earbuds. Then, when they make a phone call, the woman tells them to be quiet. The user responds by pointing out that her own behavior is rude and that people use headphones for a reason. She insists she's right, and the user then plays a music video full volume on their iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the woman was being loud in a public space, which is generally considered impolite. The user tried to ignore it at first. When confronted, the user defended themselves by highlighting the woman's own actions. Then they took it further by playing loud music on their own device as a form of retaliation. \n\nNow, the user is asking if they were wrong. Let's break it down. In public spaces, there's an unspoken social contract to consider others and not disrupt them. The woman was violating that by not using headphones. The user's initial response of using earbuds was reasonable. When the woman approached, the user's verbal response was also in line with pointing out the issue. However, when the woman continued to be rude, the user escalated the situation by playing loud music themselves. \n\nRetaliation with the same behavior might be seen as taking the situation into their own hands. Even if the woman was at fault, the user's action of playing loud music could be seen as equally rude. Public spaces require mutual respect, and while the woman was wrong, the user's response could have been more measured. Instead of playing loud music, maybe they could have politely asked her to lower the volume again or ignored it further. \n\nSo, even though the woman started the problem, the user's use of loud music as payback might not be the best approach. It's possible that the user's action was a direct response to teach a lesson, but in a public setting, such a reaction can be perceived as equally disruptive. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for escalating the situation with their own rude behavior.\n"
