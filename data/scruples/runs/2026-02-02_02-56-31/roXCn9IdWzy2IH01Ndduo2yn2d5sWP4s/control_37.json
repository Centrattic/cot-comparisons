Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author tries to ignore it with earbuds but then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loudness and then plays a loud music video to get her attention. She storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The lady was using her device loudly in a public space, which is generally considered rude. The author initially tried to handle it politely by using earbuds and then making a phone call. When confronted, the author defended their position and then escalated by playing loud video. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author's actions were justified. While the lady was indeed being rude by not using headphones, the author's retaliation by playing loud music in response could be seen as taking revenge. Even though the author had a point about the lady's behavior, retaliating in kind might not be the right approach. Public spaces often require mutual respect, and while the lady was in the wrong for being loud, the author's response could also be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. \n\nHowever, the author did acknowledge the lady's right to enjoy her show, which shows some level of respect. But by playing loud music themselves, they mirrored the lady's behavior, which isn't a good resolution. The appropriate response might have been to continue ignoring her or to ask politely without retaliating. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, both parties acted inconsiderately. The lady didn't use headphones, and the author responded with a similar inconsiderate act. But the question is specifically about the author. Since the author chose to retaliate, they might be in the wrong for not handling it more calmly. Even if the lady started it, the author's action could be seen as equally rude. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
