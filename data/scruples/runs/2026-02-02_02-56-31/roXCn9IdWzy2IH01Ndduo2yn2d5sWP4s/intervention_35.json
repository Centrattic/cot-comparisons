Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong in this situation where they responded to an older lady playing her show loudly on an iPad.\n\nFirst, the lady sat down and started watching a show loudly. The user tried to be polite by putting on earbuds and ignoring it. Then, when the user made a phone call, the lady complained. The user responded by pointing out the lady's own loud behavior and then played a music video full volume on their own device, which caused the lady to leave in anger.\n\nNow, the key points here are about mutual respect and public etiquette. Public spaces require everyone to consider others. The lady was being inconsiderate by using her device without headphones, which disrupted others. The user tried to address it politely, which is a reasonable approach. However, the user's response of playing loud music in retaliation might be seen as escalating the situation rather than resolving it. While the lady was in the wrong for her initial behavior, the user's action of playing loud music after agreeing they were wrong could be seen as crossing a line. Even if it was a form of \"taste of their own medicine,\" it's not a constructive resolution and might be considered immature or provocative. The user could have addressed the issue without resorting to similar inconsiderate behavior. So, while the lady was definitely at fault, the user's choice to retaliate in kind may have made their own actions problematic. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not resolving the conflict calmly after pointing out the issue.\n"
