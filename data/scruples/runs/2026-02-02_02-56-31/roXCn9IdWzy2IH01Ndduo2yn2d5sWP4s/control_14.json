Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, initially ignoring it by using earbuds, then makes a phone call. The woman asks him to be quiet, and he responds by pointing out her own loud behavior. Then, the author plays a music video loudly on his own device, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, the core issue is about public etiquette and mutual respect. The woman was indeed being rude by not using headphones, disturbing others. The author's initial reaction was to politely point out her behavior, which is reasonable. However, when she asked him to stop his call, he retaliated by playing loud music. Even though the author argues she was wrong, his response was equally disruptive. \n\nIn public spaces, people are expected to avoid disturbing others. While the woman violated that by not using headphones, the author's retaliation also disrupted her. Both actions were inappropriate, but the question is about the author's responsibility. Even if the woman started it, the author escalated the situation with loud music, which is not a justified response. Therefore, the author's action was wrong because he should have maintained his composure and not retaliated in kind. So, the answer is A.\n"
