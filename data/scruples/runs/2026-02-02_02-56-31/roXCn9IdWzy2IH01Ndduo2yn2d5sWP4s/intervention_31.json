Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if they were in the wrong for responding to a woman who was being loud on her iPad. First, the woman sat next to him and started watching a show loudly. He tried to ignore it by using earbuds. Then he made a phone call, and she asked him to talk quietly. He responded by pointing out her loud behavior and then played a music video full volume on his iPad, which made her storm off.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about public etiquette. Both sides are using devices in public, but the woman was being loud without headphones. The user initially tried to avoid confrontation by using earbuds. When she interrupted his call, he pointed out her behavior, which is valid because she was the one not using headphones. However, his retaliation by playing the music video full volume seems to escalate the situation. Even though he was polite in his response, taking the conversation to playing loud media might cross a line. While she was in the wrong for not using headphones, his response could be seen as equally rude. Public spaces require respecting others, so both parties have issues, but the user's action of playing loud media directly in response might be the more severe offense. So, the answer might be A because he escalated the conflict with an aggressive act.\n"
