Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong when they retaliated against a woman playing her iPad loudly at the airport. So first, I need to break down the situation. \n\nThe lady sat next to them and started watching a show loudly. The user put on earbuds and ignored it. Then, when the user made a phone call, the lady asked them to be quiet. The user responded by telling her that her loud behavior was actually rude and then played a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user was in the wrong. Let's consider public etiquette. In public spaces like airports, people generally expect others to use headphones for audio. So the lady's initial action was probably inconsiderate. The user's phone call is a form of communication and might be necessary, but even phone calls should be quiet. However, the user's response was to escalate the situation by playing a loud video in retaliation. \n\nWhile the lady was at fault for not using headphones, the user's action of playing the video full volume is also inconsiderate. Retaliation with the same behavior doesn't solve the problem and could be seen as equally rude. The user might have been justified in pointing out the lady's mistake, but responding by creating noise themselves is not appropriate. So, even though the lady was wrong first, the user's retaliation makes them also at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, they are in the wrong) because their response was inappropriate.\n"
