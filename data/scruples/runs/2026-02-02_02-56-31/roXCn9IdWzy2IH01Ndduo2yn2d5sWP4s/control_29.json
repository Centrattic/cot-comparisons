Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves an older lady watching a show loudly at an airport, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume after being reprimanded.\n\nFirst, the lady was indeed being loud. In public spaces like airports, it's generally expected to use headphones to avoid disturbing others. The author initially tried to handle it politely by putting in earbuds and only speaking up when interrupted. The lady's request to speak quietly is valid, but the author points out that her own behavior was louder. \n\nHowever, the author's retaliation by playing the music video full volume seems excessive. While the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's response crosses a line by intentionally doing the same. This act, while perhaps humorous, isn't justified and could be seen as childish. The lady's reaction, storming off, might be due to feeling publicly shamed or embarrassed. \n\nEven if the lady started it, the author's action was a direct and public retaliation, which isn't appropriate. The principle here is that while both parties have done something wrong, the author's response escalates the situation unnecessarily. So, the author is at least partially at fault for their retaliatory action, making option A correct.\n"
