Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about someone giving a woman a taste of her own behavior when she was being loud on her iPad.\n\nSo, the woman sits next to the author, starts watching a show loudly. The author puts in earbuds and ignores it. Then, the author makes a phone call, and the woman asks them to be quiet. The author responds by telling her that watching shows loudly is rude, and then the author plays a music video loudly on their own iPad, causing the woman to leave angry.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are public etiquette and mutual respect. The woman was using her device without headphones, which is generally considered impolite in public spaces. The author points this out, which is valid. However, when the author makes a phone call, that's a different scenario. Phone calls are typically expected to be conducted quietly in public, unless in a designated area. So when the woman asks the author to be quiet, she's pointing out a valid social norm.\n\nThe author's response is to escalate the situation by playing a loud video. Even though the author initially argues their point, using the same behavior to retaliate might be seen as tit-for-tat, which isn't constructive. While the woman started by being loud, the author's action of playing loud music could be considered equally rude. The author's justification is that the woman had it coming, but in public settings, mutual escalation rarely helps. The author's decision to match the woman's behavior, even if as a lesson, might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The woman was initially in the wrong by not using headphones. The author made a phone call, which can be seen as acceptable but should be quiet. The woman's interruption was a mistake, but the author's response of playing loud music was a direct retaliation. Even if the author had a point about the woman's behavior, responding with the same behavior is not appropriate. Public spaces require a certain level of mutual respect, and taking matters into one's own hands like that can lead to worse situations. The author could have addressed the issue without retaliating in kind. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation.\n"
