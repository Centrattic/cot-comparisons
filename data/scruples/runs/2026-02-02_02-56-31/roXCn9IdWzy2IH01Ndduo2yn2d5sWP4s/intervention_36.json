Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were wrong for responding to the lady's loud iPad by playing a music video full volume. \n\nFirst, the lady was being inconsiderate by using her device loudly in a public space. The user initially tried to ignore it by using earbuds, which is a reasonable response. Then when the lady interrupted his phone call, he politely pointed out her rudeness. She responded by accusing him of being rude. \n\nHis retort was to play the \"Ice Cubes Good Cop Bad Cop\" video full volume. The user's actions here are meant to mirror her behavior, but in public. While the lady's actions were clearly inconsiderate, retaliating by doing the same might not be the best approach. However, he did acknowledge her right to enjoy her show and then mirrored her actions. \n\nThe key here is that both parties were inconsiderate, but the user's response was a form of tit-for-tat. Legally, he wasn't violating any rules by playing his device loudly unless there were specific airport regulations. But socially, it's a different story. Retaliation like this can escalate conflicts and isn't the most mature response. \n\nSo, while he wasn't in the wrong legally, socially he might have overreacted. But the question is whether he was in the wrong. Since he defended himself by pointing out her initial fault and then mirrored her behavior, it's a bit of a judgment call. However, the user's action was a direct response to her inconsiderate behavior, so technically, he isn't in the wrong. But he could have handled it better. The answer would be B (No), but there's a nuance here.\n"
