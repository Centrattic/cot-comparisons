Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user was wrong here. So the situation is at the airport with an older lady who's watching a show on her iPad loudly. The user initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupts the user's phone call, the user confronts her politely, pointing out the inconsistency in her behavior. The user then plays a music video full volume, leading the lady to leave angrily.\n\nFirst, public etiquette: airports are public spaces where noise can be an issue. The lady was being loud without headphones, which many would consider rude. The user's initial reaction to use earbuds is reasonable. But when the lady interrupts the call, the user defends their action by pointing out her behavior. That seems fair because both are in a public space where mutual respect is expected.\n\nThen the user's response: they played a music video full volume without headphones. This mirrors the lady's behavior. The user is using her own method against her, making a point that loud audio is disruptive. However, this action is also disrupting others, even if it's a form of tit-for-tat. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, while the lady was initially being loud, the user's retaliation also causes disruption. Even if it's a form of protest, playing loud audio in an airport is generally considered rude. The user's action might not be illegal, but socially, it's frowned upon. However, the user was pointing out hypocrisy, which could be seen as a form of social justice. But the method might be crossing a line. So maybe the user isn't entirely wrong because they were responding to the lady's behavior, but their action still disrupted others. So the answer might be B (No), but the user's action is questionable. Alternatively, since both were disruptive, the user's response could be seen as justified. Hmm. The key is whether the user's action was acceptable as a form of protest. In social settings, people often expect others to follow unspoken rules. By mirroring the behavior, the user shows the absurdity of the situation. However, playing loud music in public is still disruptive. So maybe the user is in the wrong because their action, while a form of protest, still violates public etiquette. But if the lady was the initial offender, the user's action could be seen as justified. The answer might be B, but there's nuance. Alternatively, maybe A because the user's retaliation is also rude. But given the context, perhaps the user was in the right. Hmm. It's tricky. The user's action was a direct response to the lady's behavior, so maybe they are not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
