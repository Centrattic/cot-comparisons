Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong for responding to a woman who was playing her iPad loudly in the airport. The situation started with the woman next to them watching a show at a loud volume. The user initially ignored it by using earbuds but then made a phone call, which the woman interrupted, asking him to be quiet. The user then confronted the woman, explaining that her behavior was actually rude, and then played a music video full volume to mirror her actions, which caused her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette in public spaces. It's generally considered polite to use headphones in places like airports to avoid disturbing others. The woman's initial action of watching a show without headphones could be seen as inconsiderate. The user's response to her interruption during the phone call seems to be a form of retaliation or teaching a lesson by matching her behavior. However, this retaliation involved playing media loudly, which is the same inconsiderate action she was doing. \n\nThe key question here is whether the user's response was justified. While the woman was at fault for not using headphones, the user's actions in response could be seen as equally inconsiderate, even if it was a form of showing her the error of her ways. By playing the video loudly, the user is engaging in the same behavior they criticized, which might not be the most appropriate way to handle the situation. \n\nAlso, from a social standpoint, while the user's initial point about the woman being rude is valid, their response of mirroring her behavior could lead to more conflict and may not be the best approach. The woman's reaction was to leave, but the user's action might have escalated the situation. \n\nLegally, in public spaces, there are often rules about noise levels, but this is more about social etiquette. The user's actions, while perhaps not illegal, might still be considered rude by others. The principle of \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" suggests that retaliating in the same manner isn't the best approach. \n\nSo, while the woman was in the wrong for not using headphones, the user's response of playing loud media could be seen as equally inconsiderate. The user taught a lesson through action, but that action mirrored the inconsiderate behavior. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for responding in a way that's also inconsiderate, even if their intention was to correct the woman's behavior.\n"
