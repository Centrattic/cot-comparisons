Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were wrong in the situation where they gave the older lady a taste of her own behavior. So, the lady was watching a show loudly on her iPad in an airport. The user put on earbuds and made a phone call, but the lady asked them to be quiet. The user then responded by playing a music video full volume on their iPad, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user acted wrong. The lady was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is a common courtesy in public spaces. The user tried to address it politely but was met with an accusation of being rude. The user then escalated the situation by playing loud music in response. \n\nWhile the lady was at fault for her initial behavior, the user's response might have been a form of retaliation. However, the user's action could be seen as justified because they were pointing out the hypocrisy. But in terms of right and wrong, even if the lady was wrong, responding in kind by playing loud music could also be considered inconsiderate. Public spaces require mutual respect, and both parties should aim to be considerate. \n\nBut the user's action was a direct response to the lady's behavior. They might have been trying to show her the same experience she gave others. However, retaliating in public might not be the best approach. Even though the user had a point, their action could be seen as equally disruptive. So, there's a balance here. The user might not be entirely in the wrong because they were highlighting a problem, but their method of doing so could be questioned. However, the correct answer here would likely be that the user was justified because the lady was the initial offender, and the user's response was a way to make her understand the impact of her actions. So, the answer would be B.\n"
