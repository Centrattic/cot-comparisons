Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call and the woman interrupts them, the author responds by playing a loud music video in retaliation. The user wants to know if the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Public spaces like airports have unspoken rules about noise levels. It's generally considered polite to use headphones to avoid disturbing others. The woman was being loud, which the author rightly points out is rude. However, the author then retaliates by playing their own loud video, which is also disruptive.\n\nThe key points here are mutual disruption and escalation. The author's initial reaction to the woman's loudness is to use earbuds, which is reasonable. The woman then interrupts the author during a phone call. The author's response is to play loud music, which mirrors the woman's behavior. While the author was initially in the right to point out the woman's rudeness, retaliating with the same behavior makes them equally at fault.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the woman started the problem, the author's retaliation is a tit-for-tat response that escalates the conflict. Both parties ended up being disruptive. The author's action of playing the music video full volume is not justified, even if it's a response to being wronged first. So, the author is in the wrong because they chose to reciprocate in kind, which doesn't resolve the issue and causes further disruption. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
