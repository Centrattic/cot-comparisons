Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for responding to a woman who was being loud in the airport. So, the situation is: the woman is watching a show on her iPad without headphones, which he finds rude. He ignores it at first, puts on his earbuds, then makes a phone call. She confronts him about being rude. He argues back, points out her behavior is more disruptive, then plays a music video full volume to \"give her a taste of her own medicine.\" She storms off.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if they were in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, public spaces do have norms about noise. Using headphones is a common courtesy. The woman wasn't using them, so her actions could be seen as rude. The user, when confronted, defends himself by pointing out her behavior. That part seems reasonable\u2014he's pointing out the inconsistency. However, then he plays a music video full volume as retaliation. Even though he's responding to her, his action is equally disruptive, which is probably where the issue lies. \n\nThe key here is mutual disruption. While the woman was initially in the wrong for not using headphones, the user's response of playing loud video is equally rude. So even if he was defending his right to make a call, his retaliation escalates the situation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a moral question. The user was defending himself against what he saw as unfair criticism, but his method of doing so was also rude. So, he's not entirely in the wrong because the woman started it, but his response was also inappropriate. However, the question is specifically whether he was in the wrong. Since both parties acted inappropriately, but the user's action was a direct retaliation, it's possible the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he shouldn't have responded with equal disruption. Alternatively, B (he's not in the wrong) because he was correcting her behavior. \n\nBut considering that both were being rude, but the user's action was a form of revenge, which is generally frowned upon. So, the answer is likely A. The user should have stood his ground without retaliating in kind. Even if she was wrong, his response made the situation worse, so he's at fault for not handling it more calmly.\n"
