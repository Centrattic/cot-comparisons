Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, instead of confronting her directly, uses earbuds to listen to their phone call. The older lady then interrupts and asks the author to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loudness and then, after agreeing they're wrong, plays a music video loudly, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. Public spaces often have etiquette about noise. The lady was using her iPad without headphones, which can be disruptive. The author initially tried to ignore it and used earbuds, which is a reasonable approach. However, when confronted, the author didn't just stop their call but escalated by playing loud music themselves. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. The lady had the right to watch her show, but using headphones is expected to avoid disturbing others. The author's initial response was to point out the issue, which is fair. But then, after agreeing they were wrong, they took revenge by being loud as well. This retaliation might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the lady was wrong first. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was teaching a lesson by showing her the same behavior. But in public spaces, the expectation is mutual respect. The author's actions could be seen as provoking further conflict rather than resolving it. So while the lady was in the wrong initially, the author's retaliation might make them at fault for escalating the situation. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
