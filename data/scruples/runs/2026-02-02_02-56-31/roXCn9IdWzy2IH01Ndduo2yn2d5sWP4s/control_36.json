Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly in return after a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The older lady starts by being loud with her iPad. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her, pointing out the rudeness of her actions. The woman defends herself, and the author sarcastically agrees, then plays loud music. The woman storms off.\n\nNow, assessing who's at fault. The woman definitely started the problem by being loud in a public space where using headphones is expected. However, the author's response escalates the situation by retaliating with loud music. While the author's initial confrontation was justified (as using headphones is standard in public), the retaliation might be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author was right about the woman's behavior, playing loud music in response is not a polite or appropriate solution. It's an equal but opposite rudeness, which doesn't resolve the issue but creates a worse environment.\n\nSo, even though the woman was wrong first, the author's action of playing loud music is a form of retaliation that's not acceptable in a public setting. Both had issues, but the question is about the author being in the wrong. Since the author escalated it by playing loud music after the confrontation, they likely are in the wrong for their response, even if the initial complaint was valid.\n"
