Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in a situation where they retaliated against a woman who was being loud on her iPad at the airport.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The woman sat next to them and watched a show loudly. The user put in earbuds and ignored it, then made a phone call. The woman got upset and asked them to be quiet. The user responded, pointing out that her volume was the issue. Then, they sarcastically agreed they were wrong and proceeded to play a loud music video, which made the woman storm off.\n\nThe user is asking if their actions were wrong. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nHmm. The key here is whether the user's retaliation was justified. The initial issue was the woman being loud. The user used earbuds to avoid the noise, then made a call. The woman interrupted them, so the user pointed out her behavior. But then the user took it a step further by playing loud music themselves, which escalated the situation. \n\nEven though the woman started it, the user's response was to mirror her behavior. That's a common phrase, \"give someone a taste of their own medicine,\" but it's often considered retaliatory and not the best approach. Public spaces do have norms, and while the woman was wrong to be loud, the user's response of playing loud music could be seen as equally rude or disruptive. \n\nAlso, the user's sarcastic agreement with the woman might have been a passive-aggressive move, which could be seen as insincere. The user then took action that directly mirrored the woman's behavior. So even if the woman was at fault first, the user's actions could be considered wrong because they didn't resolve the issue politely and instead escalated it. \n\nIn public, the appropriate response might be to ask the person politely to lower the volume or use headphones, and if that's ignored, perhaps inform an airport authority. Retaliating by being loud yourself, even if it's to make a point, can be seen as equally rude. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (wrong) because the user didn't handle the situation constructively and instead chose a retaliatory approach, which is not considered appropriate even if the other person started it.\n"
