Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong when they retaliated against the woman who was being loud on her iPad. So the scenario is at an airport. The woman sits next to them, starts watching a show loudly. The user ignores it at first, puts in earbuds, then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts and tells the user to be quiet. The user responds by pointing out that she's being rude by not using headphones, then sarcastically plays music full volume, leading to her storming off.\n\nHmm, the user is asking for a judgment call. The options are A (they're wrong) or B (not wrong). Let me break it down. The woman was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is a public place. The user tried to ignore it by using earbuds. When the woman complained about the user's phone call, the user retorted by pointing out her loud behavior. Then, the user took it a step further by playing music loudly as a form of retaliation. \n\nSo the key points here: Did the user overreact? Was their response justified? The woman was clearly being rude by not using headphones, which is expected in public. The user's initial response was to politely point out the issue. Then, when the woman complained, the user sarcastically played music loud. That seems like a form of revenge rather than a peaceful solution. Even if the user felt wronged, responding in kind might not be the right approach, especially in a public setting. However, the woman was indeed at fault initially. \n\nBut the user's action of playing music full volume is also inconsiderate. The user is mirroring the woman's behavior, which could be seen as equally rude. So even though the woman started it, retaliating in the same way might make the user equally wrong. The user's actions could have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The user might have a point in being upset, but the response might not have been appropriate. So in terms of the question, the answer would be A (they're in the wrong) because their retaliation was inappropriate, even if the woman was initially at fault.\n"
