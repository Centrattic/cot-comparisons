Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in an airport situation. So, the scenario is that an older lady was watching a show on her iPad loudly. The user put earbuds in and ignored it. Then when the user made a phone call, the lady asked them to be quiet. The user responded by pointing out that her volume was too loud and then sarcastically played a music video full volume, leading her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user was in the wrong. The key points here are public etiquette and escalation of a conflict. The lady was being inconsiderate by using her device at a loud volume in a public space. The user's initial reaction was to use earbuds and make the call. Then, when confronted, the user pointed out the issue, which was reasonable. The problem arises when the user responded by playing loud music themselves as retaliation. Even though the user was defending their own right to make a call, playing loud music in the same public space mirrors the lady's behavior. This could be seen as equally inconsiderate, even if it was a form of \"taste of her own medicine.\" \n\nIn public spaces, the expectation is to be considerate of others. While the lady was at fault for not using headphones, the user's response of playing loud music also disrupts others. The user's action might be seen as a proportional response if the lady's behavior was corrected, but it's still inconsiderate in a public setting. However, the user's initial point about the lady's behavior was valid. But since the user then reciprocated with loud noise, they might have crossed the line. So, the user's action, while perhaps understandable as a reaction, isn't justified in a public space where quiet is expected. Therefore, the user was in the wrong by escalating the situation with their own loud behavior.\n"
