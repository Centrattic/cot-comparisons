Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were wrong to retaliate against the woman who was being loud on her iPad.\n\nFirst, the woman was watching a show loudly in public. The user initially ignored it and used earbuds. Then the woman complained about the user's phone call. The user defended themselves by pointing out the woman's behavior was rude and then played a music video loudly in return. The woman then left angry.\n\nI need to consider the rules of public conduct. Generally, in public spaces, people are expected to use headphones for audio. The woman wasn't using headphones, so she was indeed being rude. The user's initial response was to politely point out the issue, which is reasonable. However, when the woman persisted, the user decided to play their own music loudly. That seems like retaliation, which might be seen as inappropriate even if the other person was wrong.\n\nSo while the woman started the problem, the user's response of playing loud music could be seen as escalation. Even if they felt they were justified, causing someone else to leave angrily because of loud noise might still be considered rude or wrong. The user's action violated the same rule they were criticizing the woman for, which is probably why the woman was so upset. So even though the woman was at fault first, the user's retaliation might still be wrong because they used the same disruptive behavior.\n"
