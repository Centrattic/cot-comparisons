Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story did something wrong by retaliating against the lady who was watching a show loudly on her iPad. \n\nFirst, the lady sat next to the author and started watching a show at a loud volume. The author tried to ignore it by using earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the lady asked him to be quiet. The author responded politely but pointed out her own loudness. The lady then insisted she had the right to enjoy her show. In response, the author played a music video loudly on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author was in the wrong. The key points here are about public behavior and mutual respect. Both parties were in a public space, so there's an expectation to consider others. The lady's initial action was definitely rude by not using headphones, which is a common courtesy in public. However, the author's response, while perhaps a form of retaliation, might be seen as equally rude. \n\nBut wait, the author did point out the lady's mistake politely first. Then, when she dismissed his argument, he escalated the situation by playing loud music. Even though the lady was in the wrong initially, the author's actions mirrored her behavior. Public etiquette usually advises resolving conflicts calmly rather than retaliating. By playing loud music, the author disrupted others similarly to how the lady did. So, even if the lady started it, the author's action could be seen as equally inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was just giving her a taste of her own medicine, which could be a form of teaching a lesson. However, in public spaces, the expectation is to avoid causing disturbances regardless of the provocation. Therefore, the author's action might not be justified and could be seen as wrong because he escalated the situation instead of diffusing it. \n\nSo, considering both sides, while the lady was initially at fault, the author's retaliation might also be considered wrong because it didn't resolve the issue and instead caused more disruption. Public behavior guidelines typically discourage such direct retaliation. Hence, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
