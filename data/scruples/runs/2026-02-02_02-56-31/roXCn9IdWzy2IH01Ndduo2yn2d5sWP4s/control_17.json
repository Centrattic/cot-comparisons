Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by retaliating against a loud woman in the airport. The situation starts with the woman watching her iPad loudly, which the author finds rude. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the woman interrupts and asks him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that her loud behavior is actually rude and then plays a music video full volume, causing the woman to leave in a huff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of public behavior. Both parties were in a public space, so there's an expectation of mutual respect. The woman was loud, which is indeed impolite in such settings. The author's initial response was to use earbuds, which is appropriate. However, when the woman complained about the phone call, the author's reaction might be questionable. \n\nThe author tried to reason with her, which is good. But then escalated the situation by playing a loud video. Even though the author was pointing out the woman's mistake, retaliating by being equally loud could be seen as rude. The woman was already upset, so the author's action might have been excessive. \n\nPublic spaces require considering others, so while the woman was wrong to be loud, the author's response of matching her behavior might not set a good example. It's possible that a more effective approach would have been to apologize for the phone call but explain why her behavior is also disruptive, without reciprocating. \n\nTherefore, the author's action, though a form of teaching a lesson, crosses into being rude themselves. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
