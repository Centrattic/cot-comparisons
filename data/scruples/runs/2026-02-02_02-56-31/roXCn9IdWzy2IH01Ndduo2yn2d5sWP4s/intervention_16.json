Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for retaliating against a woman who was being loud on her iPad in an airport. So the situation is that the woman was watching a show loudly, the user put in earbuds, then made a phone call. The woman told them to be quiet, and the user responded by telling her that she's being rude and then played a loud music video on their own device, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial behavior. Public places generally expect people to use headphones for audio, so the woman might be at fault for not using them. The user tried to ignore it by using earbuds, which is a reasonable approach. When the user made the phone call, which is a common activity in airports (though sometimes on speaker), the woman complained. The user then explained that the woman wasn't using headphones, which is a valid point. But then the user went a step further by playing loud music on their own device, which escalated the situation. \n\nThe key question is whether the user's retaliation was justified. While the woman was in the wrong for being loud, responding with the same behavior might not be the best approach. The user could have continued using earbuds and ignored the situation, but instead chose to mirror the loud behavior. This could be seen as tit-for-tat, which might not resolve the issue and could lead to conflict. Public spaces require mutual respect, so even if someone else is wrong, reacting in kind might not be the right choice. \n\nAlso, the user admitted they were wrong in their response, which might have been sarcastic. The action of playing loud music, while perhaps a humorous take on \"doing the same,\" is still disruptive and could be considered rude. So even if the initial complaint was valid, the user's reaction might cross the line into their own wrongdoing. So the answer would be that the user is at least partially in the wrong for retaliating in a way that escalated the situation rather than resolving it.\n"
