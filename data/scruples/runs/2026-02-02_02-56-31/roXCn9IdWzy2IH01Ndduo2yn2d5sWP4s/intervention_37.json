Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong when they retaliated against a woman who was being loud on an iPad at the airport. \n\nFirst, the woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The user initially tried to avoid confrontation by putting in earbuds. Then, when the woman asked the user to quieten their phone call, the user pointed out the woman's own loud behavior. \n\nThe key moment is when the user decided to play a music video full volume in response. Even though they were polite in their initial response, retaliating with noise seems to mirror the woman's behavior. The user's action could be seen as equally rude, even if it was a form of paying her back. \n\nPublic spaces require consideration for others. While the woman was definitely at fault for not using headphones, the user's response might not be the best way to handle it. Instead of matching her behavior, perhaps reporting to airport staff or ignoring it further would have been better. \n\nSo, even though the user had a valid point about the woman's actions, their own action of playing loud music could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for responding with similar behavior.\n"
