Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were wrong in a situation where they confronted a lady for being loud with her iPad. So the setup is they were at the airport, the lady sat next to them, started watching a show loudly. He puts on earbuds, then makes a phone call. She interrupts and tells him to be quiet. He responds by pointing out the noise from her show and then plays a music video full volume, which makes her storm off.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The lady was using her device without headphones, which is indeed considered rude in public. The user tried to ignore it first by using earbuds, which is a reasonable approach. Then when he made a call, she complained. He politely explained that her volume was the issue. So far, he's being respectful.\n\nBut then he decides to play a music video full volume on his iPad. That's turning the tables, right? Even though she was wrong, his response was to do the same. So, even if both parties are being loud, his action of playing the video loudly is also a breach of social norms. Public spaces require consideration for others, so using headphones is expected. By playing it loud, he's violating that norm again. \n\nThe user might think they're giving her a taste of her own behavior, but that's not a justification. Retaliation isn't the solution. The correct approach would have been to continue using earbuds and maybe not engage further, or politely suggest she use headphones without escalating. His action of playing the music video full volume was an escalation and thus rude. So even if she was wrong, his response was also wrong. Therefore, the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
