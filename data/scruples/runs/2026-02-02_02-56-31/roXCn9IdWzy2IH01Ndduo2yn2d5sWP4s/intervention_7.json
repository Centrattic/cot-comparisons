Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in this airport situation. So, here's the scenario: an older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly in the airport. The user first ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then, when the user makes a phone call, the lady interrupts them to ask to speak quietly. The user responds by pointing out that she's being loud, and then they take it a step further by playing a music video at full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nThe user is asking whether they were wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. I need to determine if their actions were appropriate or not. \n\nFirst, the lady was being loud. In public places, it's generally considered polite to use headphones if you're watching videos or shows. So her behavior was rude. The user initially tried to ignore it by using earbuds, which is a reasonable response. When the lady interrupted the user's phone call, that's a problem. Phone calls in public can be disruptive if they're loud, but the user was using earbuds during the call, so maybe the volume wasn't an issue. The user then responds by telling her that she's the one being loud, which is a valid point. \n\nThen the user takes it a step further by playing a music video full volume. That's escalating the situation. The user is doing to her what she did to them. So even though the lady was in the wrong for being loud, the user's retaliation by playing loud video might be crossing a line. The user's actions could be seen as taking revenge, which might not be the best approach. \n\nSo while the lady was wrong for being loud, the user's response might be considered inappropriate because they retaliated in a way that caused her to leave angrily. The user could have continued to ignore her or perhaps asked politely again, but playing loud music as a form of payback might not be the right approach. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for their escalation of the situation.\n"
