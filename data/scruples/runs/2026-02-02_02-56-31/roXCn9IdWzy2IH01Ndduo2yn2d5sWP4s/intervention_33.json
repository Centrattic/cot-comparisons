Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong when they responded to a woman's loud iPad in the airport by playing a music video full volume. \n\nFirst, the situation: the woman was watching a show loudly, the user tried to ignore it by using earbuds. Then when the user made a phone call, she complained. The user responded by pointing out her loudness, then sarcastically agreed she was right and played loud music themselves, causing her to leave angry.\n\nNow, considering the rules of public spaces: generally, using headphones for audio devices is expected to avoid disturbing others. The woman wasn't using headphones, which is rude. The user was polite in pointing this out. But then, when the user played loud music in response, that's their own form of being loud publicly, which is also rude. Even though it's a reaction to the woman's behavior, it's not justified because it escalates the situation. The user's action could be seen as retaliatory and equally inconsiderate. So while the initial issue was the woman's fault, the user's response crosses into their own wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is A (they are in the wrong for their retaliation).\n"
