Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong in their actions at the airport. So, the situation is that an older woman was watching a show loudly on her iPad. The user initially ignored it and used earbuds. Then when making a phone call, she asked them to be quiet. The user responded by pointing out her loud behavior, then later played a music video loudly on their own device after agreeing she was right. The woman got angry and left.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they were in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To determine this, I need to assess both sides.\n\nPublic spaces usually have unspoken rules about noise. Using headphones is expected to avoid disturbing others. The woman not using them could be seen as rude. However, the user's response was to escalate the situation. Initially, they politely pointed out her behavior, which is reasonable. Then, when she accused them of being rude, they played loud music themselves as a form of retaliation. \n\nThis retaliation might be seen as escalating the conflict rather than resolving it. Even if the user felt they were being treated unfairly, responding in kind could be considered equally rude. The woman's reaction was to storm off, which suggests she felt wronged by the user's actions. \n\nSo, even if the woman was initially at fault, the user's choice to play loud music after agreeing she was right could be seen as hypocritical or vengeful. Public behavior should ideally be considerate, and the user's action, while perhaps a reaction to provocation, might not be the best way to handle it. \n\nTherefore, the user might be in the wrong because their response was not constructive and could be seen as equally disruptive. Hence, answer A (yes).\n"
