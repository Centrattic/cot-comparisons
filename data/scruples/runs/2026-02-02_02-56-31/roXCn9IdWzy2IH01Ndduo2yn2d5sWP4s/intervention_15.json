Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is at an airport. An older woman sits next to the user and plays her show on an iPad loudly. The user initially ignores her and uses earbuds. Then the user makes a phone call, which the woman objects to, asking them to be quiet. The user responds by pointing out that she's being loud and not using headphones. The woman insists she has the right to watch her show. Then the user, in a sort of retaliatory act, plays a music video at full volume with their iPad, leading the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman was indeed being rude by playing her device loudly in a public area. That's a common complaint in public spaces where people expect some level of quiet. The user's initial response of using earbuds and ignoring her seems reasonable. When the woman interrupts the user's phone call, which is a common activity in airports, the user points out the woman's behavior. That seems fair because she was the one being loud. \n\nHowever, the user's retaliation by playing a music video at full volume is the key point here. Even though the woman was at fault, the user's response might be seen as excessive. Both were using public space, and while the woman was in the wrong initially, the user's reaction could be considered equally rude or inconsiderate. The user's actions might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. Even if it's a form of \"giving her a taste of her own medicine,\" it's still a public disruption. \n\nSo, while the woman started the problem, the user's response could be seen as equally inappropriate. The question is whether retaliating in kind is justified. In public spaces, mutual respect is important, but responding with the same behavior doesn't resolve the issue and can lead to more conflict. The user might be in the wrong for not maintaining their own composure and for escalating the situation instead of diffusing it. So, even though the woman was initially at fault, the user's actions were also inconsiderate and rude. Therefore, the answer would be A, meaning the user is in the wrong.\n"
