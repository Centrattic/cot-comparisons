Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person did the right thing here. So, the situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching her show loudly on an iPad. The user, who's sitting next to her, initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupts the user's phone call to ask him to be quiet, the user responds by playing a music video full volume on their own tablet. The lady gets really upset and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of public spaces. In places like airports, people are expected to use headphones for audio to avoid disturbing others. The lady wasn't using headphones, which is generally considered rude. The user tried to point this out politely, explaining that the lady's behavior was the issue. But then, when the lady insists she's right and he's wrong, the user takes it to the next level by playing loud music in response. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the user's retaliation was justified. Even though the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, responding with the same behavior might escalate the situation unnecessarily. Public etiquette often emphasizes resolving conflicts calmly rather than matching the other person's rude behavior. The user's action could be seen as provoking the situation further, leading to the lady's anger. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the user was just showing her the consequences of her actions, mirroring her behavior to make her understand how it feels. But the problem with this approach is that it's a form of passive-aggressive retaliation and can lead to escalation, which happened here. The lady was clearly upset, and the user's action might have crossed a line from being a polite reminder to an intentional act of disruption.\n\nAlso, in public spaces, even if someone is wrong, responding in kind can set a bad example and potentially lead to more conflict. The user had the chance to de-escalate by continuing to use headphones and not engaging further, but instead chose to provoke, which resulted in a negative outcome. \n\nSo, while the lady was definitely at fault for not using headphones, the user's response might not be the best approach. It's important to address the issue without becoming part of the problem. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for escalating the situation with their own loud behavior, even if their initial point was valid.\n"
