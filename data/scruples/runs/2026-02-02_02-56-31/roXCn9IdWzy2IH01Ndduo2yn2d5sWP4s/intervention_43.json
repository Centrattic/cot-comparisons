Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong to retaliate against the woman who was being loud on her iPad at the airport. \n\nFirst, the situation: the woman is watching a show loudly, and the user initially ignores it, then uses earbuds and makes a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The user responds by pointing out her own loudness and then plays a video full volume on their own device when the woman claims her right to do so.\n\nSo, the user's actions escalate the situation. They respond to the woman's rudeness with their own, mirroring her behavior. The key points here are public etiquette and retaliation. Public spaces often require consideration for others, so using headphones is expected. The woman was clearly in the wrong first by not using headphones. However, when the user was asked to lower their voice during a call, they responded by playing loud video, which is also rude and uncivil. \n\nEven though the user was right to point out the woman's mistake, their response of playing loud music is not an appropriate solution. Retaliation with the same behavior doesn't resolve the issue; it just escalates it. The user could have calmly reminded her again about using headphones without resorting to playing loud content themselves. \n\nSo, while the initial complaint from the user was valid, their response was not. They crossed the line by engaging in the same behavior they criticized. Therefore, the answer is A (they are in the wrong).\n"
