Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: an older lady is at the airport, watches a show on her iPad loudly. The author ignores it at first, uses earbuds. Then when the lady interrupts the author's phone call to ask to be quieter, the author responds by playing a music video full volume on their own iPad, causing the lady to get angry and leave. The author is asking if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's think about public etiquette. The lady was loud, which is impolite. The author tried to reason politely, pointing out the lady's own behavior. But then, as a retaliation, the author played a video full volume. Even if the author felt they were being rude, using the same tactic might be considered escalating the conflict. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect in public spaces. Both parties had issues, but the author's response was to play loud media, which is also rude. Even if the author was annoyed, responding in kind isn't really solving the problem; it's just retaliation. \n\nAlso, the author initially used earbuds, which is the proper way to handle phone calls in public. The lady didn't use headphones for her show, which is the real issue. The author's action of playing loud video might have been excessive. \n\nBut wait, the author was polite when talking to the lady, then after agreeing to apologize, they took it a step further by playing loud music. That seems like a calculated act to teach a lesson, which might cross the line. Even if the author felt justified, it's a public place and such actions can cause more disruption. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is also in the wrong because their response was not appropriate. They should have either continued to ignore the lady or handled it without escalating. Retaliation with loud media isn't the right approach, even if the other person was wrong. Both parties have responsibilities to maintain public decorum.\n"
