Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds by playing a music video full volume on their own device.\n\nFirst, the woman's action of watching a show loudly in public is indeed disruptive. Public spaces generally expect people to use headphones for audio. The author's initial response of wearing earbuds is a reasonable way to avoid the noise without confrontation. \n\nWhen the woman interrupts the author's call, she's pointing out that the author is using a phone without headphones. The author then argues that the woman's actions are more rude. This part is tricky. The author might be defending their own behavior, but the woman's complaint is valid because phone calls are typically expected to be quiet in public. \n\nThe key moment is when the author decides to play the music video full volume in response. This is a direct retaliation. Even though the woman was being loud, the author's action is also disruptive and goes beyond a polite response. The author's action escalates the situation, which is not appropriate. \n\nWhile the woman started the conflict, the author's retaliation is equally inconsiderate. Both parties have done something wrong, but the author's action was a deliberate act of giving the woman a taste of her own behavior. Since the author chose to retaliate in kind, they're complicit in being disruptive. \n\nSo, even though the woman was at fault first, the author's response makes them share the blame. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their retaliatory action.\n"
