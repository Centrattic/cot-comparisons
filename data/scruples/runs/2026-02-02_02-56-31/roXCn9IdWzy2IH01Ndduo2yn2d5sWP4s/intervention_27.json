Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong in this airport incident. So, the older lady was watching a show loudly on her iPad. The user initially put in earbuds and ignored her. Then when they made a phone call, she asked them to be quiet. The user responded by telling her that watching without headphones is rude and then played a loud music video on their own device, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, the user's actions need to be evaluated. The lady was using her device loudly, which is generally considered impolite in public. The user tried to address it politely first by pointing out the issue. But then, when the lady accused them of being rude, the user escalated the situation by playing a loud video. This seems like retaliation. While the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, the user's response was to mirror her behavior, which is not a good solution. Retaliation with similar behavior might not be the best approach, even if the other person is at fault. The user should have perhaps escalated to an airport staff member or found another way to resolve it without playing loud videos themselves. So, while the lady was wrong, the user's action of playing loud video was also inappropriate. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't handle it calmly and instead took a confrontational approach.\n"
