Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict at the airport between the author and an older lady.\n\nFirst, the lady sits next to the author and watches a show on her iPad loudly. The author puts in earbuds and ignores it. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts, asking her to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the lady's loud TV is rude, and then in a sarcastic way, says she's wrong and proceeds to play a music video loudly on her own device, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nThe key points here are about public behavior and mutual respect. Both parties are using electronic devices in a public space. The lady is using the iPad without headphones, which is generally considered inconsiderate because others can hear. The author uses earbuds, which is more respectful. When the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds by playing loud music, which escalates the situation.\n\nLegally, both have the right to be in the airport. However, the author's response to the lady's request was to retaliate by playing loud music, which is equally inconsiderate and rude. The author's sarcastic apology and subsequent action of playing the music video full volume is a clear act of revenge, not a polite resolution. Even though the lady was wrong to watch her show loudly, the author's response was equally disruptive and not the appropriate way to handle the situation. The author could have continued using earbuds and ignored the lady, but instead chose to take it to a higher level. So, the author is in the wrong because they retaliated in a way that was just as inappropriate as the lady's initial behavior.\n"
