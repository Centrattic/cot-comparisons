Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about an airport incident where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author responds by talking loudly on their phone call. The woman then criticizes the author, and the author retaliates by playing a music video loudly, causing the woman to leave in anger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed considered rude in public spaces because it affects others. The author initially tried to avoid confrontation by putting on earbuds and even made a phone call, which the woman interrupted. The author then confronted her, pointing out her loud behavior. \n\nThe key part is the author's response after the woman criticizes them. The author plays a music video loudly in retaliation. While the author's initial complaint might be valid, their response of playing loud music is also a form of public disturbance. Both actions\u2014loudly watching a show and loudly playing music\u2014violate the same social norm of being considerate of others' space. \n\nThe author's justification is that the woman was being rude, so they retaliated. However, retaliation doesn't make the action right. Even if someone is inconsiderate, responding in the same manner perpetuates the problem. The airport environment is a shared space, and both parties failed to use headphones, which are the appropriate tools to avoid such conflicts. \n\nThe author's admission that they were wrong initially might be a way to justify their own actions, but the fact that they then escalated the situation by playing loud music means they are also being inconsiderate. So, while the woman started it, the author's response was equally at fault. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for retaliating in a way that also disturbed others.\n"
