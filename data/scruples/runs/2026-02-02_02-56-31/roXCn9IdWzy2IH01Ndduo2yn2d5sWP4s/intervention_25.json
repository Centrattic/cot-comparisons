Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong for giving a woman a taste of her own behavior in the airport.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman was watching a show loudly on her iPad. The user initially ignored it and used earbuds. Then, when the user made a phone call, the woman asked them to quiet down. The user responded politely, pointing out the woman's own loud behavior. Then, the user took it a step further by playing a music video full volume on their own device, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nSo, the user's main argument is that they were responding in kind to her rudeness. They used her own tactics against her. But was that justified? \n\nIn public spaces, there are generally norms about noise levels. Using headphones is expected to avoid disturbing others. The woman was violating that norm. The user's phone call, while using earbuds, might have been considered normal if the user was using the earbuds properly. But the user didn't have their earbuds in when making the call, which could be the issue. Wait, the user says they made a phone call using their earbuds. Wait, no, they put their earbuds in but then made a phone call, which would presumably be through the earbuds, so the call wouldn't be loud. But the woman interrupted anyway. \n\nThen the user responded by playing a loud video, which is the same as what the woman did. The user is trying to mirror her behavior, but that's escalating the conflict. Even if the user believes they were in the right, retaliating in the same way might not be the best approach. \n\nLegally, everyone has the right to use their devices, but in public, there are social norms and sometimes rules about noise. So the woman was wrong to play her show loudly. However, the user's response of playing loud music is also a violation of those norms. So, both parties are violating the same norm, but the user took it a step further by intentionally doing the same thing the woman did, leading to a worse outcome. \n\nThe key point is that the user escalated the situation by retaliating in kind. Even if they felt justified, using the same harmful behavior isn't a good solution. It turns a minor conflict into a bigger public confrontation. The appropriate response would be to calmly point out the issue and perhaps ask politely, but not to retaliate. \n\nSo, the user's action of playing loud music after the woman apologized in a sarcastic way (saying they were wrong) was a deliberate act of giving her a taste of her own medicine. While the initial conflict had the woman at fault, the user's response is problematic because it's not a constructive solution. Therefore, the user is also at fault for escalating the situation with their own rude behavior.\n"
