Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author puts in earbuds and then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts and tells the author to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that the woman is being rude by not using headphones. Then the author pretends to agree and plays a music video at full volume, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both parties' actions. Public places like airports often have unspoken rules about noise. Using headphones is expected when watching videos to avoid disturbing others. The woman violated that by not using headphones. The author tried to ignore it at first but then made a phone call, which is more direct and might be seen as louder. However, phone calls can be more intrusive because they involve talking out loud, which is different from passive noise from a video.\n\nWhen the woman asked the author to quiet down, the author's response was to point out the woman's behavior as rude. But then the author escalated the situation by playing a loud music video in retaliation. This seems like a tit-for-tat response, which isn't typically considered appropriate conflict resolution. Even though the woman started it, the author's retaliation might be seen as equally rude. The author's action of playing a loud video could be considered just as disruptive as the woman's initial behavior. So, while the woman was in the wrong first, the author's response is also problematic. However, the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. The author's actions crossed the line by intentionally causing disruption. So the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because retaliation isn't justified even if the other person was wrong. But sometimes people might see it as a justified reaction. But in terms of right and wrong, escalating the conflict isn't the right approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
