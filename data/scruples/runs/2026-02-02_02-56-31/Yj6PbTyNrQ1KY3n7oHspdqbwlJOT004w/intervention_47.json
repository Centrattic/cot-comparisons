  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong to kick his pregnant ex out after discovering the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the context: They were together for 2 years, had issues with her not working and possible cheating. He broke up with her, but when she got pregnant and asked to stay, he agreed with a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he asked her to leave.\n\nHe's facing criticism from friends, but he's torn. The key points here are paternity, his emotional state, and the responsibility towards the child. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot with the breakup and betrayal. He might feel justified in his decision because he's not the biological father and the relationship was already in trouble.\n\nBut there's a moral aspect too. Even if he's not the father, the child is vulnerable. Some might argue he has a responsibility since he initially agreed to support her during the pregnancy. However, once the paternity test cleared him, his obligation might be seen as lifted. The ex's cheating complicates things, and he might feel betrayed again.\n\nHe's also considering the child's best interest. If her parents are harmful (smoking), maybe he did the right thing by not letting the child stay there. But now the ex is staying with a friend, so maybe that's a safer environment.\n\nThe friends' criticism might be pushing him to reconsider, but it's his personal decision. Legally, he's not wrong, but morally, it's subjective. Depending on the culture or personal ethics, some might see him as selfish for not helping, while others support his right to walk away after being wronged.\n\nSo, balancing legal, emotional, and moral factors, the answer might hinge on whether one believes biological parentage is the only basis for responsibility. If he feels no connection, he's not in the wrong. But if moral responsibility is based on initial intentions, he might be.\n"
