It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they were wrong to kick their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, they were in a 2-year relationship that ended because he broke up with her when she was unemployed and relying on his financial support. He suspected infidelity. Then she came back pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She was happy to do that. After the test showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now, others are calling him a bad person for not helping her and the child, but he's torn between his emotional state and whether he's being unfair.\n\nSo, legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. But maybe there's a moral or ethical angle here. He had agreed to take her in under the condition of the test, and once the result came in, he changed his mind. But she's now in a situation where she's staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. Some might see him as abandoning her in a vulnerable time, even though he's not the father. Others might argue he's not responsible since he's not the father, especially after she cheated and he was already financially strained.\n\nHe's feeling emotionally raw, which is understandable. The question is whether his actions were wrong. Legally, no obligation, but morally? If he's being pressured to take care of someone else's child, maybe there's a different perspective. However, he was already in a difficult relationship where he felt used financially. The cheating is a big factor too. So, while he might not be legally wrong, the moral answer could be more nuanced. But the question is about being in the wrong, which is subjective. Depending on societal expectations, some might think he's wrong to not help, while others think he's justified. But since he's not the father, maybe the answer is B (No), but there's a middle ground where he's not in the wrong, but could be seen as uncaring. But the options are A or B. I need to decide based on common standards. People often feel a duty to support even if not legally obligated, but given the circumstances of cheating and financial strain, maybe it's B. So answer B.\n"
