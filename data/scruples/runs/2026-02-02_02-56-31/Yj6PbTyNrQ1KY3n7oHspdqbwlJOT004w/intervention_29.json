  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the ex had a rocky relationship, he broke up with her when she was jobless and he was supporting her. She came back saying she's pregnant, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here: The man isn't the biological father. He had agreed to the test, which she accepted. Once the result came in, he decided she couldn't stay. Others are criticizing him for not helping the child.\n\nLegally, if he isn't the father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally, he's been through betrayal and stress. But the woman is pregnant, and the child isn't his. So the main question is about moral responsibility.\n\nHe might feel he's not responsible, especially since the woman cheated. However, some might argue that even if not the father, he could still offer help. But since he's not the father, others might say he's not in the wrong. The user is conflicted between his emotional state and societal pressure.\n\nSo, considering all factors, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
