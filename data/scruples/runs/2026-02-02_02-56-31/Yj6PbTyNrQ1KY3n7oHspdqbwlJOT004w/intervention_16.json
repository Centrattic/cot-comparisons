  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether they are in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the couple had been together for two years. The relationship was rocky because the girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on the user's financial support. The user suspected cheating and eventually broke up with her. She moved back with her parents.\n\nThen she came back, claiming to be pregnant, and the user let her stay again on the condition of a paternity test. She agreed. The test showed the child isn't his. He asked her to leave. Now, she's with friends, and mutual friends are saying he's wrong for not helping the child. The user is conflicted, feeling emotionally raw and questioning his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here: legal responsibility, emotional state, and ethical considerations. Legally, if the user isn't the biological father, he isn't obligated to provide support. However, if he was led to believe he was the father, there could be legal implications, but in many places, you can't be legally required to support a child you're not the father of. \n\nEmotionally, the user was already in a stressful situation. The girlfriend cheated, and the user had to deal with financial strain. The paternity test confirmed his fears, leading to betrayal. It's understandable he wants space, especially after the emotional turmoil.\n\nEthically, the user isn't responsible for a child that isn't his. The girlfriend knew the paternity test was a condition when she agreed to stay. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he's justified in asking her to leave. The user isn't obligated to support someone else's child, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he should still help if he feels a moral obligation, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since the child isn't his, and the girlfriend had the chance to get a test before staying, he's not in the wrong for deciding not to be involved. The mutual friends' opinions might stem from not understanding the full context of the relationship's history and the test agreement.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
