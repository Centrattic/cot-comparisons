  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by kicking out his pregnant ex when he found out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the backstory: They were together for 2 years, had a rocky relationship towards the end, he broke up with her because she wasn't working and he suspected cheating. She then came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, friends are telling him he's wrong for not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a breakup, suspected cheating, and the emotional toll of possibly being a father, only to find out it's not his. He's feeling used and betrayed. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, some might argue that even if it's not his child, he might feel responsible because he was involved with the mother. However, he had set the condition for the paternity test upfront, which she agreed to. That shows he was trying to be responsible. Once he found out it wasn't his, he had the right to decide his living situation. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that by taking her in after the breakup, he might have given the impression of commitment, even if it wasn't legal. But he was clear about the paternity test condition. The mother is the legal guardian, so the responsibility is hers. \n\nHe's also dealing with emotional trauma from the relationship. Friends are pressuring him, which is common when people feel guilt. But he's making a choice based on his own well-being. \n\nSo, considering all this, he's not in the wrong. He followed through on his conditions, and once the test showed the child isn't his, he's not obligated to stay. The answer is B.\n"
