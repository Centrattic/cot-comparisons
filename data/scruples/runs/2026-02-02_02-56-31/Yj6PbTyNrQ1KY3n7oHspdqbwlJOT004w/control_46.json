It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. The couple was together for two years, then the relationship got rocky when the girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work. The author suspected cheating and broke up, leading her to live with her parents. She later came back, announced the pregnancy, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test revealed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author was wrong. Let's break down the factors. The author had already ended the relationship due to cheating and financial issues. The woman then claimed pregnancy, which led him to agree to her living with him again, but with a paternity test. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he felt betrayed and kicked her out.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't legally responsible for a child that isn't his. However, the moral aspect is more complex. The woman might be in a vulnerable position, pregnant and without stable housing. The author is being criticized for abandoning her, especially with the unborn child. But he also has his own emotional well-being to consider after being cheated on and financially strained.\n\nThe user is struggling with guilt, feeling torn between his emotions and the pressure from friends. He's asking if he's in the wrong. The key points here are consent to the arrangement (paternity test agreement), the betrayal from cheating, and the subsequent discovery of not being the father. The author made a decision after a test he agreed to, so there's a sense of mutual agreement on the condition. Once the result came in, his decision to end the living arrangement isn't necessarily wrong, as he wasn't the biological father.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once he became aware of the pregnancy, he had a moral responsibility to support her regardless of paternity. But since the test was a condition he set and she agreed to, his actions are within his rights. The woman's friends might be criticizing him, but their perspective could be from a place of seeing her vulnerability, not considering the prior cheating and the test agreement.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted based on the information he had and the conditions he set. While the situation is sensitive, he's not in the wrong legally or morally, given the circumstances and his prior agreement on the paternity test. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
