It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves him kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. They were together for two years, broke up because she lost her job and wasn't working, and he suspected her of cheating. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant, and he agrees to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test shows the child isn't his, he kicks her out.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether he's morally or ethically wrong for doing that. The ex and friends are calling him a bad person for not supporting the child. The author is conflicted, feeling emotional and unsure if he's a \"total piece of shit.\"\n\nI should consider a few angles. Legally, if the child is not his, he's not obligated to support it. But morally, it's more complex. He was in a relationship where he believed the child was his, which adds to the betrayal when it turned out not to be. Also, she cheated, which complicates things. He's been through a lot emotionally, and now he's struggling with whether he should take responsibility for a child that isn't his, especially after the cheating.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is pregnant and needs support. The author provided a home initially, but after the paternity test, he felt betrayed and decided to end the arrangement. The friends argue he should help because the child is innocent. But the author's own well-being and emotional state are also factors here.\n\nI need to check if the paternity test was a mutual agreement. From the story, it seems like both agreed to the test, so he wasn't forced into that arrangement. Once the test results came back, he's justified in re-evaluating his decision. However, the child's needs are also important. But since it's not his biological child, his legal responsibility is minimal unless he's accepted a role in the child's life. But he had already ended the relationship, so stepping back might be reasonable.\n\nThe emotional toll on the author is significant. He's been through a breakup, possible infidelity, financial strain, and now the betrayal of the paternity test. It's understandable he might not want to take care of a child he didn't father, especially under those circumstances.\n\nBut there's also the argument that even if the child isn't his, supporting her during pregnancy and childbirth is humane. However, the story mentions she's staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. The author's home was a safer environment, but he's not obligated to provide that if he's not the father. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's decision was unfair. Since the child isn't his and he had a prior agreement to test, his reaction is understandable. However, some might argue that once he's involved in the pregnancy, he has a moral obligation. But given the circumstances of the cheating and the emotional state, it's a tough call. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people might see the author as justified, especially given the betrayal and the test agreement. But others might think he should help regardless. The answer is tricky, but leaning towards no, he's not in the wrong because the child isn't his and the context of cheating and prior breakup plays a role.\n"
