It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, had a rocky relationship, he broke up with her because she wasn't working and he suspected cheating. She came back pregnant, he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave. Now, people are telling him he's a bad person for not helping.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, the breakup, then all that again. He agreed to the test, and once it was clear he wasn't the father, he felt relieved? Or maybe he was in denial. The key points are consent to the test, the result, and his decision post-result. \n\nBut society might see it as cruel because she's pregnant and vulnerable. However, he's not the biological father. If she cheated, that adds to the betrayal. Also, financial support is a big factor here. He's already been supporting her financially, and now with the child not his, he might not want to take on that responsibility. \n\nHowever, there's a question about responsibility. Even if it's not his child, maybe he still has some moral obligation if they were in a relationship. But if the child isn't his, legally and morally, he's not required to support another man's child. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's the one who asked her to stay, maybe there's an expectation of support. But the paternity test was a condition. He did agree to the test, so once results were in, he followed through. \n\nBut the emotional angle: after cheating and the stress, he's justified in not wanting to be involved. She's staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking, which he considered for her child's health before the test. Now that it's another's child, his obligation is gone. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the child isn't his, and he had a condition in place. Others might argue about compassion, but legally and based on consent, he's not wrong. However, it's a complex situation. But the key is that he agreed to the test and followed through once the result was clear. The fact that she cheated also plays into his emotional state. So, he's not in the wrong.\n"
