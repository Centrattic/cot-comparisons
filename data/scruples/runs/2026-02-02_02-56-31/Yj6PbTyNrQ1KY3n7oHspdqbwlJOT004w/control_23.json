It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. So, the guy and his ex had a rocky relationship. She lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he suspected her of cheating. He broke up with her, and she went to live with her parents. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant, and he lets her move back in because her mom smokes, which he doesn't want the baby exposed to. They agree to a paternity test. When it turns out the kid isn't his, he kicks her out.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, when she told him she was pregnant, he allowed her to stay in his house as a favor because of her mom's smoking. He made a condition that they do a paternity test. She agreed. Once the test came back negative, he felt betrayed again, because she might have cheated, and decided she should leave. \n\nBut wait, when he let her stay, did he know there was a possibility she might be lying about the paternity? He suspected cheating before, so maybe he was already aware that the child might not be his. He agreed to let her stay under the condition that they test. So by doing the test, he was making a conscious choice. Once the test showed it's not his, he no longer felt responsible. \n\nHowever, the baby is an innocent party here. The user is asking if he's being unfair to the unborn child. The ex is now staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking. The friends are saying he should help. But he's struggling emotionally. \n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, there's no obligation to support the child. But morally, some might argue that he should still help since he was the one who allowed her to stay in his home, expecting to be the father. However, he had the paternity test as a condition, so maybe he made his decision based on that. \n\nOn the other hand, he might have been manipulated. She might have known the baby wasn't his and still asked to stay, which could be seen as taking advantage. But the user is conflicted, feeling like maybe he should still help. \n\nThe key points here are consent and conditions. He allowed her to stay under the condition of testing. Once the test was done, and the child isn't his, he's not legally bound. Emotionally, he feels betrayed because of the cheating. So his decision to kick her out is based on the test result and his own feelings. \n\nBut then, the baby's well-being is a factor. If he has the means and wants to help, maybe he should. But he's not obligated. So whether he's in the wrong depends on the perspective. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's subjective. Some might say yes because he enabled her by letting her stay, others might say no because he followed through with his condition. \n\nThe answer is probably B (No) because he's not legally responsible and followed through with the test. But people might have different opinions. He's not in the wrong, but there's a moral gray area. So the answer is B.\n"
