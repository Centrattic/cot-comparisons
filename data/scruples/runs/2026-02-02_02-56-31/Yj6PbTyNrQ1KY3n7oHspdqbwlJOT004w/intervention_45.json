  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. Let me start by understanding the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, they were in a 2-year relationship. The relationship became rocky when the girlfriend lost her job and didn't look for work, relying on the user financially. The user suspected cheating and eventually broke up with her, leading her to live with her parents. Then she came back, saying she was pregnant and claiming it was his child. The user let her stay with the condition of a paternity test, which she agreed to. After the test showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out.\n\nNow, the user is being criticized by her, her friends, and mutual friends for not supporting the unborn child. He's feeling conflicted: he's been through emotional turmoil, found out about her cheating, and is questioning if he's wrong for not taking care of the child.\n\nSo, the main points here are legality, moral responsibility, and emotional aspects. Legally, in most places, a man isn't automatically the legal father unless proven through paternity tests or acknowledged. Since the test showed he's not the father, he might not have legal obligations towards the child. That's a key point. However, there's a moral question here. Even if he's not the legal father, some might argue he has a moral responsibility if he believed the child was his and had planned to support the pregnancy.\n\nEmotionally, the user was in a vulnerable state. He broke up with her over cheating, which is a betrayal. Then he was led to believe he was a father, which adds to the emotional stress. Finding out the child isn't his after investing emotionally could lead to a strong reaction. But does that justify kicking her out, especially when she's pregnant and vulnerable?\n\nThere's also the consideration of her parents' environment. She mentioned her mom smokes, which is harmful to the unborn child. The user wanted to provide a healthier environment, but after finding out the child isn't his, he didn't continue that support. Is it fair for him to prioritize his emotional state over the child's well-being? But again, if he's not the father, maybe he's not responsible for that.\n\nAnother angle is the initial arrangement. He allowed her to stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed to that. So, perhaps he had a right to decide based on the test results. However, once the test was done and the child isn't his, he could have continued to support her out of kindness, even if not legally obligated. But that's a choice, not an obligation.\n\nThe friends' opinions are that he should take care of the child, but if he's not the father, that might be outside his responsibility. However, if he had been supportive prior to the test, maybe some expect him to stay and help. But since the test cleared him, maybe he's under no obligation.\n\nMoral responsibility can be subjective. Some might say that once you get involved in a pregnancy, even if the paternity is later proven otherwise, you have a duty to help. Others might say that once the test is done, he's off the hook. The user is struggling with his emotions, which is valid. He's been betrayed, had a stressful breakup, and now this. It's a lot for anyone to handle.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if there was no coercion or illegal action, he might not be in the wrong legally. But morally, some could argue that he's being selfish by not helping a pregnant woman in need, even if she's his ex. However, it's also fair for him to prioritize his mental health and not feel obligated to care for someone else's child when he's already been through so much.\n\nThe key here is the paternity test. If he's not the father, he has no legal duty. Whether he has a moral duty is a personal choice. The user's actions, based on the test results, might not be in the wrong from a legal standpoint, but socially, there's pressure to help regardless. But he's not required to do so. So, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because of the legal clarity and the agreed-upon condition of the paternity test.\n"
