  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. So, the user had a relationship with his girlfriend that ended because he suspected she was cheating and she was unemployed, leading him to break up. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, and he kicked her out.\n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, paternity is important. If he's not the biological father, he might not have legal obligations towards the child. Legally, he might not be responsible for the child's upbringing unless he's been acting as the legal parent. But the user is now being criticized for not providing support, so maybe there's a social or moral expectation here.\n\nEthically, there's a debate. Some people might argue that even if he's not the biological father, he was emotionally invested and might have a moral duty to support the mother and child, especially if they're in a vulnerable situation. Others might say that he's justified in not taking responsibility since he wasn't the father and the relationship had issues, including cheating.\n\nHe mentions that mutual friends are calling him a bad person, which adds social pressure. However, his emotional state is raw after the betrayal, and he feels overwhelmed. It's important to consider his mental health here. If he's not in a good place emotionally, forcing himself to take care of someone else's child could be harmful for both him and the child.\n\nAnother angle: the mother's responsibility. If she's the one who ended up pregnant and the child isn't his, she's the legal guardian. The user isn't obligated to help unless he's in a de facto parent role. If he's not legally responsible, maybe it's not his duty to provide housing.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of being a good person. Even if he's not legally bound, some might argue that helping in a compassionate way is the right thing to do. However, he's not required to sacrifice his own well-being for others. It's a balance between personal boundaries and societal expectations.\n\nHe also had a prior agreement for a paternity test, which she agreed to. That shows he wasn't hiding from responsibility but wanted clarity. Once the test was done, he acted on the information he received. That seems fair. He wasn't in a situation where he was blindsided; he had the facts and made a decision based on that.\n\nCheating is a significant betrayal. If she was cheating, that's a valid reason for the breakup and his distrust. The emotional toll of that betrayal combined with the stress of an unexpected pregnancy might have contributed to his decision to end the living arrangement.\n\nIn summary, legally and ethically, he's not obligated to take care of the child. He made a decision based on test results and his personal circumstances. The friends' criticism might stem from a place of wanting to support the mother and child, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. He has the right to prioritize his emotional health and financial situation, especially after the previous issues in the relationship.\n"
