It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. They were in a 2-year relationship, had a rough time, he suspected cheating, broke up, then she came back saying she's pregnant. He let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he made her leave again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the paternity test shows he's not the father, then legally, he has no obligation to support the child. So from a legal standpoint, he's not required to take care of the child. But maybe there's an emotional or moral angle here.\n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. The ex cheated on him, he supported her financially while she wasn't working, and then the betrayal of her cheating and the child not being his. He's feeling emotionally raw. He might be justified in not wanting to take care of someone else's child, especially after all that.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that once he found out the child wasn't his, he should still help, maybe out of compassion for the mother or the unborn child. But others might say he's not responsible for their situation. The ex's friends are calling him a terrible person, but maybe that's because they don't see the full context of the cheating and the emotional turmoil he's been through.\n\nAlso, the ex was living with her parents, but her mom smokes a lot. The author thought his home would be healthier. Now that he's kicked her out, she's staying with a friend. Maybe he's concerned about the child's well-being, but since the child isn't his, his responsibility is less. However, if he's the legal father, he might have obligations, but the test proved otherwise.\n\nHe's struggling with whether he's being unfair to the unborn child. But if the child isn't his, then maybe he's not responsible. His main responsibility is to himself after the betrayal. But maybe there's a point where helping is the right thing, regardless of the situation. But again, that's more of a moral stance.\n\nSo in terms of right or wrong, legally he's in the clear. Emotionally and morally, it's more complex. He's had a lot of trust broken, and acting on that to prioritize his own well-being might be understandable. But some might argue that he could still help out the mother, even if the child isn't his. However, considering the circumstances of the cheating and the emotional stress, it's a tough call.\n\nI think the key points are the confirmed cheating, the paternity test results, and his own emotional state. Since the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it. His decision to leave is based on the betrayal and the fact that the child isn't his. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
