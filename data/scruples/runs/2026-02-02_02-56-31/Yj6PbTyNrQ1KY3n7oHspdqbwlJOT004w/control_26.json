It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy found out the child his ex is pregnant with isn't his. He kicked her out of his house. They had agreed to a paternity test, which she agreed to. After the test came back negative, he told her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, a man is not automatically the legal father unless he signs the birth certificate or there's a court order. Since the paternity test proved he isn't the father, his legal obligation to support the child might not exist. But maybe there's more to it if he had previously acted like a father.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. He agreed to let her stay in his house with the condition of the paternity test. She was upfront when she found out she was pregnant. After the test, he's justified in wanting to cut ties, especially since he was in a vulnerable emotional state and she had cheated on him. However, the baby is innocent. If he's not the father, maybe he's not responsible for supporting them. But some might argue that he has a moral obligation if he was in a committed relationship and she relied on him financially before the breakup.\n\nHe also mentions she lost her job and wasn't looking for work. That might have contributed to his stress. But once the paternity test cleared that he's not the father, his responsibility might be seen as over. However, others might say that even if he's not the biological father, he's part of the situation and should help. But that's a stretch if there's no legal obligation.\n\nThe friends are telling him he's a bad person for not taking them in. Maybe they don't realize the emotional toll this situation has taken on him. He was already through a breakup, suspected cheating, and financial strain. His emotional state is a factor here.\n\nOn the other hand, the baby is going to need support regardless. If the ex's parents are smoking, it's bad for the baby. But the author isn't the father now. He might not have an obligation to provide a safe environment unless he's the legal guardian. The ex's friend situation is temporary, but maybe the author could help without taking them in. But he might be justified in wanting to distance himself after the betrayal.\n\nI think the key points are the legal paternity, mutual agreement to test, and the emotional impact. The author isn't the father, so he's not legally bound to support the child. The emotional betrayal and the agreed-upon test result mean he's justified in cutting ties. However, some might argue that even without legal obligation, there's a moral duty if he was in a relationship with the mother. But given the circumstances and the agreed conditions, he might not be in the wrong.\n"
