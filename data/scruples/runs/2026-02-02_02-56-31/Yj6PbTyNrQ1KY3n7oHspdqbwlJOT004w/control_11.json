It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out the child his ex-girlfriend is pregnant with isn't his. He kicked her out of his house. Now, people are calling him a bad person, and he's confused.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The ex was with him for two years, then they broke up because she wasn't working and he suspected cheating. She came back when she found out she was pregnant, and he let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his. Then he asked her to leave.\n\nSo, the question is whether he was wrong to kick her out. Let's think about the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the paternity test is accurate, then he isn't the father. As the father, there's a legal responsibility, but if he isn't the father, he doesn't have that obligation. However, even if he isn't the father, there's a moral or social expectation to help, especially with a pregnant woman and an unborn child. But does that apply here?\n\nHe had a relationship with her, but they broke up. He was under the impression the child was his, but after the test, he realized he's not the father. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, etc. He might feel betrayed, which added to his decision.\n\nBut from the other side, the ex is pregnant and the child isn't his. If he's not the father, maybe he's not responsible. However, some people might argue that he could still help out for the child's sake, even if he's not the father. But others might say that he's not obligated, especially if he found out the child isn't his. Also, considering she cheated, that's a betrayal which might justify his anger.\n\nThe author is feeling conflicted because he's being criticized for not helping. But is it fair to hold him responsible if he's not the father? Legally, probably not. But socially, there might be pressure. But the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the ex could have known the child wasn't his and maybe used the pregnancy to get back into his life. But the author did get a paternity test, which is the responsible thing to do. Once the test came back negative, he had the right to change his mind. It's his home, and he can choose who lives there.\n\nHowever, if the ex is now in a worse situation because of this, maybe there's a moral obligation. But if she's staying with a friend, maybe she's okay. The author is dealing with his own emotions, which is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't the father, he was honest, did a paternity test, and after the truth came out, he asked her to leave. That's his right. The people calling him a bad person might not realize he's not the father. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
