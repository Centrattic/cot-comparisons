It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation step by step. The man and his ex had a two-year relationship. It got rocky because she lost her job and stopped looking for work, making him support them financially. He suspected she was cheating, broke up with her, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she's pregnant. He lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test shows the child isn't his. He kicks her out. Now, she and mutual friends are saying he's being unfair.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the man provided support, did a paternity test, found out he's not the father, and decided she should leave. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the man isn't the biological father, he might not have a legal obligation to support the child. However, if there was any legal establishment of paternity (like signing a birth certificate or being listed on it), that might change things, but the story doesn't mention that. So legally, he might not be responsible.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, it's more complicated. He's dealing with betrayal from cheating and the stress of potential fatherhood. When the test shows he's not the father, he no longer feels responsible. But the woman is pregnant and needs support, and he's in a position where he could help, despite the betrayal. \n\nSome might argue that even if he's not the father, he might still have a responsibility to support her during her pregnancy, especially if they were in a relationship. Others might say he's under no obligation since he's not the father and the relationship ended. However, the woman's friends are calling him a terrible person, suggesting societal expectations might pressure him to help.\n\nThe key factors here are consent and the terms they agreed upon. He set the condition of a paternity test, which she agreed to. Once the test came back negative, he followed through with his decision. That seems fair in the context of their agreement. However, the broader question is about his responsibility beyond that. If he's in a position to help, even if not legally obligated, some might say he should offer support out of compassion. But others might say he's not to blame for choosing not to.\n\nThe man's emotional state is also a factor. He's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, and the emotional rollercoaster of potential fatherhood. His decision might be a self-preservation response. However, the woman is in a vulnerable state, and he might be cutting ties when support is needed.\n\nBut the question is specifically about whether he's in the wrong. If he followed through on a mutual agreement (paternity test) and then made a decision based on the results, he's not necessarily wrong. However, if there were any other commitments or if he's in a position where helping her is feasible, some might argue he should still assist. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the terms they set and whether he's being consistent. Since he had the test done and she agreed, he's acting on the outcome. There's no indication he's acting maliciously; it's more about his own emotional limits. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
