It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a girlfriend who got pregnant. He agreed to let her stay with him again after she came back to tell him about the pregnancy, but they agreed to do a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he kicked her out. Now, people are criticizing him for not supporting the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and his ex had a rocky relationship, especially when she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially. He suspected cheating, which turned out to be true. She moved back in with him temporarily for the paternity test, which he insisted on. When the test showed he wasn't the father, he asked her to leave. \n\nHe's being accused of being a bad person for not helping the unborn child. But he's also dealing with emotional trauma from the breakup, betrayal, and the stress of possibly being a father. The question is whether he's obligated to support the child if he isn't the biological father. Legally, if he's not the father, he has no legal obligation. However, ethically, some might argue he should still help, especially if he was involved in the pregnancy.\n\nBut wait, he was under the impression that the child was his, so maybe he had good intentions. Once the test proved otherwise, he's not responsible. His decision to let her stay was conditional on the paternity test. She agreed, so maybe he's within his rights to revoke the arrangement once the test is done. Also, he's not the biological father, so he doesn't owe the child anything. However, some might say that he should still support the mother and child out of moral responsibility, but that's more of a personal choice.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional state of the author. He's been through a lot, and his decision might be a reaction to the betrayal and stress. But that doesn't make it right or wrong. The mother is now responsible for the child, and he's not the father. So, legally and ethically, he's not in the wrong. The people criticizing him might be assuming he's the father still, but the test cleared that up. He's also considering his own well-being, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, if he had already started providing support or made commitments, there might be more to consider. But according to the story, he only let her stay temporarily to get the test done. Once the test was done, his agreement was fulfilled, and he's not obligated anymore. The unborn child's needs are important, but the author isn't the parent here. So, he's not in the wrong for deciding not to take responsibility for a child that isn't his, especially after confirming it through the test.\n"
