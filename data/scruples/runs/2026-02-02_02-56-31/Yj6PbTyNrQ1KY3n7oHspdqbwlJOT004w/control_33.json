It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe key points here are: They were together for two years, broke up because she was unemployed and he suspected cheating. She came back when she found out she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he asked her to leave. Now, she and mutual friends are criticizing him for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether he's obligated to help with a child that isn't his. Legally, if the paternity test is confirmed, he isn't the father, so he has no legal responsibility. But there's an emotional and moral aspect. He's been through a lot\u2014cheating, breakup, financial strain. The user might be considering the emotional toll on him versus the unborn child's needs.\n\nBut wait, the mother has her own responsibilities. If the father isn't the biological parent, the mother is the one responsible. However, the author is being pressured by friends to take care of the child. There's a cultural aspect where people might expect him to step up, even if he's not the father, but that's not legally required. \n\nHe also mentions that she cheated. Cheating is a betrayal, and combined with the fact that the child isn't his, it's a double betrayal. That could justify his feelings of wanting her to leave. On the other hand, the child might be affected by the unstable environment, but the mother's parents are problematic too. \n\nThe author is in an emotionally raw state. He's allowed to prioritize his own well-being after being betrayed. However, there's a risk that the child might end up in a worse situation if the mother's parents are smoking around them. But the author isn't the legal father, so he's not legally bound to provide a home. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author has a moral obligation beyond the legal. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to take care of a child that isn't his, especially after being lied to and cheated on. Since the child isn't his, he's not legally responsible. Morally, it's complex, but he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his mental health after such a betrayal. The answer is B.\n"
