It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex-girlfriend were together for two years. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he was financially supporting her. He thought she was cheating, which led to a breakup. She then came back, pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's being a bad person for not taking care of the unborn child.\n\nThe main question is whether he's wrong to not want to help her now. So, I need to consider a few things. Legally, he's not the father, so he's not obligated to support the child. Emotionally, he's been through a lot with the breakup and betrayal. But he might feel responsible because he allowed her to stay in his house initially. Did he have a responsibility once he found out it wasn't his child? Also, her parents have issues (smoking), so she's staying with a friend instead. \n\nHe's being criticized for not helping, but he's also in a vulnerable emotional state. However, the child isn't his, so maybe he's not responsible. But there's an argument that once he was involved in her life, even after the paternity test, he might still have some moral obligation. On the other hand, he's not legally bound. \n\nI think the key points are: he's not the father, he was supporting her under the assumption he was, and now he's choosing to distance himself. Some might say he's being selfish by not helping, but others might say he's justified in not taking on responsibilities that aren't his. The fact that he did allow her to stay initially could complicate things. Maybe he's partially at fault for getting involved again without ensuring the child's support. But since the child isn't his, he can't be held legally responsible. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the focus is on legal obligations or moral ones. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's more subjective. However, the person is asking if he's in the wrong, and the options are yes or no. The author might be seen as not in the wrong because the child isn't his, and he's not obligated to help. But some might argue he should have ensured her and the child's support regardless. However, given the circumstances, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
