It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after a paternity test showed the child wasn't his. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The ex and the author were together for two years, but things got rocky. She lost her job, wasn't contributing financially, and he suspected cheating. He broke up with her, and she moved in with her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay to avoid the baby being around her mother's smoking. They agreed to a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he kicked her out.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he was wrong to do that. Let's consider the facts. The author made an arrangement that included a paternity test. Once he found out the child wasn't his, he had the right to change his mind about supporting them. He had already been through a breakup, financial strain, and suspected infidelity. His decision to end the arrangement after the test is a personal choice.\n\nBut there's the other side: the woman is pregnant, and the baby is vulnerable. Some might argue that the father (the real one) should support the child, but the author isn't the biological father. The mother is the one who had the relationship with him, and she's the one who's pregnant. However, he's not the father, so he might not have legal obligations. \n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. The article mentions mutual friends criticizing him, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. He wasn't in a relationship with her anymore when the child was conceived, so he might not feel responsible. However, by letting her stay initially, he might have created an expectation of support. \n\nBut since the test showed he wasn't the father, his responsibility is lifted. It's his home, and he can decide who lives there. The woman has the right to care for her child, but the author isn't legally bound to help. \n\nConsider if the author had known from the start the child wasn't his. Would he have let her stay? Probably not. Once he found out, he had the right to revoke the arrangement. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He acted based on the information he had and the agreement they made. The answer should be B.\n"
