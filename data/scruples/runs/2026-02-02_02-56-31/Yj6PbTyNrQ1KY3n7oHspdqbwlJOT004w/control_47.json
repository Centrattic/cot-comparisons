It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. They had a rocky relationship, she lost her job, he suspected her of cheating, they broke up, and she came back to tell him she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the baby isn't his, he made her leave again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a child is born, the father has certain responsibilities even if he's not the biological parent if he's been acting as the father. But here, the child isn't born yet. So maybe there's a different legal stance. Also, paternity tests are important because if he's not the father, he might not have legal obligations. But what about the child's well-being? If he's not the father, maybe he doesn't have a duty to provide a home.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The ex cheated on him, which he found out. That betrayal might be a reason for him to feel hurt and not want to be involved. However, the unborn child isn't responsible for the mother's actions. But the question is whether he has a responsibility towards the child. If he's not the father, maybe he doesn't. However, if he's been acting as a partner, there might be social or moral expectations to help, even if biologically not the father.\n\nHe's being criticized for not providing a home when the mother's parents smoke. But if he's not the father, maybe he's not obligated. On the other hand, if the child is in a harmful environment, maybe society expects him to step in if possible. But is that his responsibility if he's not the parent?\n\nThe user is conflicted. He feels emotionally raw, betrayed, and is struggling with whether he should take responsibility. The key points are: legal fatherhood (which isn't established here), his emotional state, and the mother's situation. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether he has any legal or moral obligation. Since he's not the biological father and the child isn't born yet, legally he might not have a duty. Morally, it's a gray area. If he's not the father and the mother is the one responsible, maybe he's not in the wrong for not wanting to help. However, if he's been acting as a father, there might be expectations. But since he found out the baby isn't his, and the mother is the one who cheated, he's not responsible for the child's well-being. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
