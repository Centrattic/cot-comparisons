  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the user and his ex had a two-year relationship. It was rocky when she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back, told him she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay to avoid her parents' habits (smoking, etc.). They agreed to a paternity test, which came back negative. He asked her to leave, and now people are judging him.\n\nSo, the key points here: legal paternity, emotional state, financial burden, and social pressure. Legally, if the test proved he's not the father, he isn't obligated to support the child. Emotionally, he's been through betrayal, breakup, and then this. He might feel used or manipulated. Financially, supporting another person could be a strain if he's already stretched thin.\n\nBut there are moral and ethical considerations. Even if he's not the biological father, the mother is his ex, and he chose to take her in. Socially, people might argue he should help because the child is vulnerable. However, he's entitled to his own emotional well-being. If he's being pressured by friends, maybe they don't realize the complexity of his situation.\n\nPotential angles: Was the paternity test a mutual agreement? If so, he had the right to leave after the results. However, if he knew the risk and still took her in, maybe he's responsible. Also, her cheating was confirmed, which adds to his betrayal. The user mentions feeling emotionally raw, so maybe he's not in a place to support a child.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Legally, he's not the father, so no legal obligation. Morally, it's more ambiguous. If he wanted to be involved, maybe there's an obligation to help. But if he's not the father and doesn't want to take on that responsibility, especially after betrayal, it's a personal choice. The ex's actions (cheating, not working) contributed to the breakup, so perhaps he's justified in not taking her back.\n\nHowever, the child is innocent. But the user isn't the father, so his responsibility is to his own well-being. If he's being called a terrible person, maybe society's expectations are conflicting with his personal boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Emotionally and morally, it's a gray area. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards B (No), as he's not legally bound and has the right to prioritize his emotional state.\n"
