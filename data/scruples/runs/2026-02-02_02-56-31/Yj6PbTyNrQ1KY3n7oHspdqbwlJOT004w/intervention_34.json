  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. First, there's the issue of paternity. Legally, if the test shows he's not the father, he isn't responsible for the child. But then there's the emotional aspect. He had agreed to support her, thinking he was the father, and now feels betrayed because she cheated. But the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHe provided a house and support, which is a big deal. But once he found out the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Mutual friends are saying he's being unfair. From a legal standpoint, he has no obligation to support someone else's child. However, morally, since he was under the impression he was the father and was willing to help, some might argue he has a responsibility to help now. But others might say that since he's not the biological father, especially if there's infidelity involved, he's justified in walking away.\n\nThe emotional toll on him is real too. He's been through a rocky breakup, financial strain, and betrayal. It's a tough situation. But the unborn child is vulnerable. Even if the user isn't the father, there's a societal expectation to help someone in need. But he also has his own well-being to consider. It's a balance between personal responsibility and moral obligation. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about responsibility towards others' children. Legally, he's not at fault, but morally, it's a gray area. So the answer could be B (not wrong) because he's not legally responsible, but there's a debate on morality.\n"
