It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend when he found out the child wasn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, broke up when he suspected cheating and she became financially reliant on him. She came back saying she was pregnant, they agreed to a paternity test, and when it came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nHe let her stay with the condition of the test because her mom smokes. Now, after she left, friends are telling him he's a bad person for not helping. He's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nSo, what's the ethical angle here? The main points are the paternity test result, the initial breakup due to cheating and financial issues, and the current living situation.\n\nThe author's actions are based on the paternity result. If the child isn't his, he feels no obligation. He also had prior issues with her, like cheating and not contributing financially. However, the ex is pregnant, and the baby is vulnerable. But since it's not his child, maybe he's not obligated to care for them. \n\nBut there's another angle: even if the child isn't his, he allowed her to live with him before the test. Now that she's pregnant, maybe he has some responsibility to protect the child from her mother's environment (smoking). However, he's not the father, so legally and ethically, is he responsible?\n\nAlso, cheating was confirmed, which adds to the betrayal. He's been through emotional turmoil. But the question is about fairness towards the unborn child. If the child isn't his, perhaps he isn't in the wrong for not wanting to take them in. However, some might argue that he should still help because the mother is in a bad situation. But others might say he's not responsible for someone else's child.\n\nThe friends' pressure is another point. They say he should help, but he's questioning his own feelings. The key is whether not providing shelter to an unrelated pregnant woman (due to paternity) is wrong. Since the child isn't his, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he had a duty to protect the child from her mother's environment, maybe there's some responsibility. However, he can't be forced to take them in if he's not the father. \n\nSo, possible answer is B (No), because the child isn't his, and he's not obligated to care for them. However, some ethical perspectives might argue for A, but the text says he's not the father, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
