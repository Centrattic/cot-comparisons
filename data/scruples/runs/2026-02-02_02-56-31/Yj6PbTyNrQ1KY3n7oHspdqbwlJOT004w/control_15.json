It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex. The author, let's call him the user, had a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. The relationship was rocky towards the end when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on his financial support. He suspected she was cheating, so he broke up with her, and she moved in with her parents.\n\nThen, she comes back to tell him she's pregnant, and he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. They do the test, and it turns out the child isn't his. The user then kicks her out, and now people are saying he's in the wrong for not helping the unborn child. The user is confused because he feels betrayed and is emotionally raw.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if he's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The user provided a home for the pregnant girlfriend after the breakup, but only under the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his. He then asked her to leave. The main issue here is whether he's morally obligated to continue supporting the child once he's proven not to be the father.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the paternity test is accurate, the user isn't the legal father, so he has no legal obligation to support the child. However, the question is about moral or ethical responsibility. The user might be feeling conflicted because he cares about the child's well-being, but he also wasn't the biological father. His decision to let her stay was conditional on the test. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he might feel justified in ending the arrangement, as he's not responsible for a child he's not related to.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once he became aware of the pregnancy and allowed her to stay, he might have a moral obligation to help, even if he's not the father. But the user did set conditions upfront, and the test was a prerequisite. Her friends and mutual friends are pressuring him to take her back, but the user is dealing with the emotional fallout of the cheating and the financial strain.\n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. If she cheated, that's a betrayal, and he's not the biological father. The user might be justified in prioritizing his own well-being after the betrayal and the stress. The fact that he allowed her to stay with the condition of the test shows he was trying to be responsible. Once the test results came back, he acted on the information he had.\n\nHowever, the user is now being criticized for not helping. Some might say he has a moral duty to support the child regardless of biology, but others would argue that he's not responsible for a child he didn't conceive. The key here is that the user made a conditional agreement, which was fulfilled, and he's not legally bound. So, ethically, it's a gray area. But given the circumstances, he's not in the wrong because he followed through with his conditions and isn't the biological father. The answer is likely B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
