  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they did the wrong thing by kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. Let me break down the facts.\n\nFirst, the couple was together for two years but had a rocky relationship, especially when the girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work. The user broke up with her, and she left to live with her parents. Then she came back, pregnant, and the user agreed to let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. They did the test, found out the child isn't his, and the user asked her to leave. Now, she's staying with a friend, and others are criticizing the user for not helping the child.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the user is in the wrong. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support them. Emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. The user had a rough time with the relationship, suspected cheating, and now feels betrayed. He's struggling with whether he should still help the child despite the circumstances.\n\nI need to consider a few points. First, was there any obligation for him to help? Since the paternity test cleared him, there's no legal duty. Ethically, some might argue he should still help, but others would say he's not responsible. Also, her cheating was confirmed, which adds to the betrayal. The user is emotionally raw, which is understandable after all that.\n\nThe user agreed to the paternity test, and once it was clear the child isn't his, his decision to ask her to leave is based on the test results. Others are telling him to take responsibility, but he might feel he's not the father. The friends' messages might pressure him, but he needs to consider his own well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the user is legally and ethically obligated. Since he's not the father, he's not in the wrong for not supporting the child. However, some might argue compassionately he should help, but the question is about being in the wrong. The answer is B (No), as he's not wrong for not taking responsibility for a child that isn't his, especially after the betrayal and the agreed-upon paternity test.\n"
