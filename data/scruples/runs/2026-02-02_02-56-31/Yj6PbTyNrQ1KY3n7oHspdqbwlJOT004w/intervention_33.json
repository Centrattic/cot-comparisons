It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe user had a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. She lost her job, stopped looking for work, he had to support them financially. He suspected her of cheating, broke up, she left to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, he let her stay again because her mom smokes and he didn't want the child exposed to that. He agreed to a paternity test, which came back negative. Then he kicked her out. Now people are calling him a bad person for not taking care of the child.\n\nSo the question is: Am I in the wrong for kicking her out after finding out the child isn't mine?\n\nFirst, legal perspective: Paternity is a legal matter. If the child isn't his, he isn't legally obligated to support them. But there's also the moral aspect. Even if he isn't the father, maybe he feels some responsibility because she was his girlfriend when she got pregnant, even though the child isn't his. But he found out she cheated, so that's a betrayal aspect.\n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. The breakup was already hard, and the cheating adds to that. The paternity test confirmed his fears. He might be in emotional pain and doesn't want to be involved with a child that isn't his, especially given the cheating.\n\nBut others are saying he should take her back and help the child. The ex is staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. So maybe he's in a position where he could help, given the circumstances.\n\nBut he's also not the father, so legally he doesn't have to. Morally, some might argue that he's being cold, but others might see it as justified given the betrayal and the situation.\n\nAlso, she was using his house as a place to stay, but he didn't have to let her back in. He made an agreement for a paternity test, and after the result, he followed through. He might not be in the wrong because he followed through on his terms. But maybe the way he kicked her out was harsh. However, the situation is complex.\n\nAnother angle: he allowed her to stay under the condition of the paternity test. Once the test showed it wasn't his, he felt he no longer had a responsibility. It's possible he's not in the wrong here because he honored his agreement and made a decision based on the test result. The other person might be in the wrong for getting pregnant with someone else's child while in a relationship.\n\nBut then again, if he had a prior commitment to her, even if the child isn't his, there might be some responsibility. But since there's no legal obligation, and the agreement was conditional on the paternity test, he might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that he should have a heart and help regardless. But the user is conflicted.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he followed through on the agreed-upon condition and isn't the biological father. However, there's a moral debate. But legally and based on the situation, he's not obligated to help, so he isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
