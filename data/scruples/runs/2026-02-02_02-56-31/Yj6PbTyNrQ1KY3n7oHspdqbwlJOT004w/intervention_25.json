It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were wrong to kick their pregnant ex out after a paternity test showed the child isn't theirs.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a two-year relationship that ended because the ex lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading to financial strain. He suspected cheating and broke up. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test proved the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. However, there's the emotional and moral aspect. The ex is pregnant, and she's in a situation where her parents smoke, which could affect the baby. The user is being criticized for not taking responsibility, but he feels cheated and is emotionally raw.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's not obligated. But morally, it's more complex. The ex might be in a vulnerable position, and his decision could impact her and the child's welfare. Even if he's not the father, there's a social expectation sometimes to support the mother, especially if she's in a bad situation. But the user feels betrayed and can't handle the emotional burden.\n\nHe did agree to the paternity test, which shows he wanted to confirm the situation. Once he learned the truth, he acted on his feelings. However, some might argue that he should have considered the ex's circumstances more, even if he's not the father. There's also the aspect of the child's well-being. If the ex can't take care of herself and the baby, maybe there's a community or government support system in place?\n\nOn the other hand, the user has his own life to consider. He might have been a victim of emotional manipulation, especially if she used the pregnancy to get back in. The fact that she cheated adds to the betrayal. He's also dealing with financial stress and emotional trauma.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the balance between his rights and the responsibility towards the child. Legally, he's in the right. Morally, it's a gray area. While he isn't obligated to help, the way he handled it might come off as harsh, especially if the ex and child are left without support. The mutual friends' criticism might be valid if there's no alternative support. However, he's justified in feeling hurt and not wanting to take on responsibilities that aren't his.\n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on societal expectations versus personal limits. Since he's not the father, he's not legally at fault. But morally, if there's no other support, some might feel he should help. However, given the circumstances of cheating and financial strain, he's also not entirely wrong. The answer might be a bit of both. But since the user is asking for A or B, and considering the legal and emotional aspects, leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) as he's not legally responsible, but there's a moral gray area.\n"
