It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex and the author were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading to financial strain. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay but with a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he kicked her out. Now, friends and others are calling him a bad person for not supporting her and the child.\n\nThe key points here are the paternity test result and the author's decision to leave. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support them. But there's the moral aspect: even though he isn't the biological father, he might still feel responsible if he believed he was. The situation also involves emotional factors\u2014his past with her, the cheating, and his emotional state.\n\nHe agreed to let her stay under the condition of the paternity test. Once the test came back negative, his responsibility might have ended. However, some might argue that he should still help because he was there for her during the pregnancy. Others might say that since he's not the father, he's not obligated.\n\nThe ex cheated on him, which adds to his betrayal. He's emotionally raw, which is a valid point. But the child is innocent. The question is whether he's responsible now. Legally, no. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might say he's not at fault because the child isn't his and he wasn't given a choice to stay. Others might say he should offer help out of kindness.\n\nThe friends are pressuring him, but their opinion doesn't necessarily determine right or wrong. The author's feelings are legitimate, but so is the potential neglect of the child. However, the child's well-being is a concern. If the parents aren't providing, maybe he should consider helping. But again, he's not the father.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author is morally obligated. If the story is accurate and the child isn't his, then legally he's not wrong. Morally, it's debatable but not necessarily his fault. The answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no hidden context, like if he knew there was a possibility the child wasn't his and still engaged with her. But according to the story, he did get the test, so he took precautions.\n"
