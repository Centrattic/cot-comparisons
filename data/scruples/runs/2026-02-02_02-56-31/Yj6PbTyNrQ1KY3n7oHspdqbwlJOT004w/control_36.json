It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that he had a girlfriend who was pregnant, but after a paternity test, he found out the child wasn't his. He kicked her out, and now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex-girlfriend cheated on him, which is a big betrayal. They had a rough time before, especially when she wasn't working and he had to support them both. He agreed to let her stay after she told him about the pregnancy, but only on the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and after finding out it's not his, he asked her to leave.\n\nFrom his perspective, he might feel that since it's not his child, he's not responsible for supporting them. He's been through emotional turmoil, including the betrayal and the breakup. He might be justified in not wanting to take care of someone else's child, especially if he didn't know about the cheating before. But on the other hand, the baby is innocent, and the mother might be struggling. Society might pressure him to help regardless.\n\nBut here's the thing: consent matters. He made the agreement to help under the assumption it was his child. Once that's proven false, the responsibility might not be his. Also, if she was cheating, that's a separate issue, but the child's well-being is a factor. However, he's not the legal father, so he isn't obligated. The question is whether he's morally in the wrong. Some might say he's not because he was deceived, others might argue that once he found out, he should still help because the child is innocent.\n\nBut the author is emotionally raw. People might judge him based on societal expectations, but legally and morally, maybe he's not obligated. However, the way he reacted\u2014kicking her out immediately\u2014might be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, including the cheating and the prior issues, he might have valid reasons. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards him not being in the wrong because he wasn't the father and had conditions for helping.\n"
