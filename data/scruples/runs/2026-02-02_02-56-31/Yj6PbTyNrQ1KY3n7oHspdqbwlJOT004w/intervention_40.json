  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after discovering the child isn't theirs. First, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if the man isn't the biological father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. But there's also emotional and social aspects to consider.\n\nThe situation starts with a two-year relationship that ended due to job loss and suspected cheating. The girlfriend then comes back saying she's pregnant, and they agree on a paternity test. When the test shows he's not the father, he asks her to leave. The key points here are consent and prior agreement. They both agreed to the test, so he wasn't keeping the child in a lie. \n\nHe's being accused of being a \"terrible person\" for not helping. But he has his own emotional turmoil from the relationship's end and confirmed cheating. The user is feeling conflicted, questioning if he's being unfair to the unborn child. \n\nEthically, if he's not the father, he doesn't have a duty to support the child. However, some might argue that once he was involved in the pregnancy, he has a moral responsibility. But since the paternity was confirmed after mutual agreement, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. He's protecting his emotional well-being, which is valid. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions\u2014cheating, losing job, initial move out\u2014might affect the dynamic. He's providing a safe environment only if he's the father, which he isn't. The user's decision, while harsh, seems based on the test results they agreed on. So, probably not in the wrong (B).\n"
