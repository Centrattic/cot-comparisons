It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether they were wrong to kick out their pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, but the relationship was rocky. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he had to support them. He suspected cheating and broke up with her. Then she came back, pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014broke up because of cheating, then had to deal with the pregnancy and betrayal. But others are saying he should help the child anyway.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's not responsible. But morally? People might argue different things. Some might say once you're part of the situation, even if not the father, you should help. Others might say he's not responsible for someone else's child.\n\nHe also mentioned that she cheated. That's a big factor. If she was unfaithful, then he didn't want to raise another man's child. That could be seen as understandable. But also, when he agreed to let her stay, he might have implicitly accepted the responsibility temporarily, but the paternity test changed things.\n\nAnother angle: he provided a home to protect the child from her parents' smoking. Now that he knows it's not his, maybe he feels the responsibility is gone. However, the child is still in a vulnerable position. But he's also dealing with his own emotional trauma.\n\nThe friends think he's being a bad person. But his perspective is that he's been through a lot. The question is whether his decision was fair. Since he's not the father, legally he's not at fault. Morally, it's more complex. He didn't ask her to stay, and she knew the condition of the paternity test. Once the test was done, he felt justified.\n\nBut maybe he should have considered alternatives for her. However, he's under no obligation. The answer likely hinges on legal vs. moral responsibility. Legally, he's right. Morally, it's a gray area. But the question is whether he was in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No), because he's not the father and acted based on the test results. But some might argue he should help regardless. However, given the cheating and his emotional state, B makes sense.\n"
