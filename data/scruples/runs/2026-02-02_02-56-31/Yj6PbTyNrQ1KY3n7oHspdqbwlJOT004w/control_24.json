It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the man who kicked out his pregnant ex is in the wrong. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, he was in a 2-year relationship that ended because she lost her job and wasn't contributing, and he suspected cheating. She moved in with her parents, but then came back pregnant. He let her stay temporarily to get a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave again. Now, people are calling him a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Paternity tests can establish legal responsibility. Emotionally, he's been through a lot: suspicion of cheating, betrayal, and the stress of dealing with her joblessness. He might feel used, especially if she knew the child wasn't his and still asked for support. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, some might argue that once he found out about the pregnancy, even if he didn't want to be involved, he should help. However, the paternity test cleared him of biological responsibility. He had a condition (the test) before agreeing to her staying. If she knew the test was coming, maybe she should have been honest. \n\nThe ex and others are pressuring him, but he's emotionally raw. He's not obligated to take care of a child that isn't his, especially after a breakup filled with conflict. His decision to set boundaries might be seen as fair, considering his own well-being and the confirmed lack of paternal obligation.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on legal and emotional factors. Since the child isn't his, and he had conditions in place, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
