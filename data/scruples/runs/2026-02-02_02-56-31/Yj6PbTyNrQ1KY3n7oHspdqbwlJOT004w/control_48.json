It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, let's look at the timeline. They were in a two-year relationship, which ended because she lost her job, wasn't contributing financially, and he suspected cheating. After the breakup, she comes back saying she's pregnant and wants to stay with him. They agree to a paternity test, which he arranges. Once the test shows the child isn't his, he kicks her out. Now she's staying with a friend, and people are criticizing him for being a bad person.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether he's in the wrong. The author is conflicted because he's been through emotional turmoil, confirmed she cheated, and now the child isn't his. He's struggling with whether he should have stayed and helped regardless. \n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Paternity tests can confirm biological relationships, and without legal acknowledgment, he's not a father. Emotionally, though, some might argue there's a moral obligation, especially if he was planning to step up before knowing the child wasn't his. But since he found out the child isn't his and there's a history of cheating, maybe he's justified in cutting ties. \n\nThe ex-girlfriend is staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking. He had let her stay initially to protect her from that, but once the paternity is confirmed, he's not responsible. However, some might say he's being selfish by not helping someone in need, even if it's not his child. \n\nBut considering the context: the breakup was his idea due to her not contributing and suspected cheating. She was living off him financially. After the breakup, she comes back with a pregnancy claim, which he wanted to verify. Once the test shows it's not his, he's relieved of any obligation. The fact that she cheated is a significant factor here. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of her being pregnant and in a vulnerable state. Even if the child isn't his, maybe he should have helped her find other support. But he's also dealing with emotional trauma. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a moral and emotional issue. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, some might argue he's being harsh, but others would say he's within his rights. The key points are the confirmed cheating, the paternity test result, and his prior decision to break up because of her financial dependence and suspected infidelity. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's not obligated to support a child that isn't his, especially after a cheater who financially exploited him during the relationship.\n"
