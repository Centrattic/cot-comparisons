It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they did the wrong thing by kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child wasn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, broke up because she was unemployed and he suspected cheating. She came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay to avoid her living in a smoky environment. They did a paternity test, which came back negative, and he asked her to leave. Now, others are saying he's a bad person for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are legal responsibility, emotional impact, and societal expectations. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support them. But there's a moral aspect here. Even if he's not the biological father, he might feel some responsibility if he had been acting as the father or if he had already bonded with the idea of being a parent. However, in this case, he only agreed to let her stay after finding out about the pregnancy, and once it was confirmed not to be his, he withdrew support.\n\nHe mentions she cheated, which adds to the betrayal. But the main issue is whether he's responsible now. From a legal standpoint, without any prior agreement or legal recognition of paternity, he's not bound to support the child. However, morally, it's more complex. If he had been providing a home and resources, and then cut her off, that could be seen as abrupt and heartless, especially with an unborn child involved.\n\nBut he also had his own emotional struggles and felt used, especially after the cheating and her financial reliance on him. The pressure from friends is making him question his decision. However, the core of the matter is his right to withdraw support once the paternity is known. If he never intended to be a father and the child isn't biologically his, he's under no obligation to continue providing a home. \n\nStill, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately after the test\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially if she's in a vulnerable state. But from his perspective, after the betrayal and the stress, he's justified in wanting to step back. The answer hinges on balancing his rights and emotional state against the child's needs. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's a gray area, but since the child isn't his and there's no prior commitment, he's not obligated. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
