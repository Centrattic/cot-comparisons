  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship that ended because the ex wasn't working and was a financial burden. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he asked her to leave. Now, she and others are saying he's being unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here are legal and emotional. Legally, paternity is a big deal. If it's proven the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it financially. However, there might be state laws about this. But the question is about moral wrong, not legal. \n\nEmotionally, he's been through a breakup, possible infidelity, financial strain. The ex cheated, which adds to his betrayal. But now he's being pressured to take responsibility for a child that's not his. He's feeling conflicted, and others are calling him a bad person for not helping.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, he's not obligated to care for a child that isn't his, especially after a relationship that ended due to cheating and financial issues. He had the test done, which cleared up the paternity, and then made a decision based on that information. The ex knew he wasn't the father but still approached him about the pregnancy, maybe expecting support. \n\nBut maybe there's a consideration for the child's well-being. Even if it's not his, he might feel a sense of responsibility. However, he's in a vulnerable emotional state and might not be in a good place to provide that support. The ex's mom smokes, so he had a good reason to let her stay initially for the child's health. But once the paternity was known, he had the right to reassess the situation.\n\nThe user is conflicted between his feelings of betrayal and the potential need to help an innocent child. But legally and ethically, if he's not the father, he's not required to support the child. However, if he's being accused of being a \"terrible person,\" that's more about social expectations than legal obligations. \n\nIn terms of fairness to the unborn child, he's not the biological father, so he's not directly responsible. But maybe there's a moral argument about ensuring the child is safe. However, since the ex is with her parents and a friend, maybe the child is safe there. \n\nSo, putting it all together, he's not in the wrong for making a decision based on the test results, especially after a relationship that ended due to cheating and financial strain. The answer is B.\n"
