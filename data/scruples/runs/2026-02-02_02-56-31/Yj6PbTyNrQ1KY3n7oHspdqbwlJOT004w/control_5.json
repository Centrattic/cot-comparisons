It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The man and his ex were together for two years. She lost her job and he had to support her, which made things rocky. He suspected cheating, broke up with her, and she left. Later, she came back claiming pregnancy. He allowed her to stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHe had a valid reason to want the test because he thought the child might not be his. Once he found out, he felt betrayed, confirmed her cheating, and didn't want to be involved. But others are saying he's being unfair to the unborn child.\n\nOn one hand, he's dealing with emotional trauma from the breakup, cheating, and financial strain. He didn't want to raise a child from another man. On the other hand, the woman is pregnant and needs support. But she cheated, which is a major betrayal. \n\nHe allowed her to stay only under the condition of the test, which she agreed to. After the test, he's not obligated to support someone else's child. But some might argue that the child is innocent. However, the woman is responsible for her actions, and the man isn't the father. So he isn't legally or morally responsible for the child. \n\nHe's in a vulnerable emotional state and might be acting on hurt and betrayal. But others might see it as abandoning someone in need. However, since he's not the father and there's confirmed cheating, maybe his decision is understandable. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a tough call. Legally, he's not responsible for the child. Emotionally, he's hurting. But the child's well-being is a concern. However, the woman's choices led to her pregnancy, and she's the one who needs to handle it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are based on the paternity test result and the confirmed cheating. He's not obligated to support the child. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
