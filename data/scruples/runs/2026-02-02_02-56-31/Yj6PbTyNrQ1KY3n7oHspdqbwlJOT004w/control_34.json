It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after discovering the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man and his girlfriend were together for two years. Their relationship became rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating, which led him to break up with her. She left to live with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay, provided they get a paternity test. After the test shows he's not the father, he tells her to leave. Now, she and others are criticizing him for being a bad person and not helping the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the man was in a breakup situation, had valid concerns about her cheating and financial situation, allowed her to stay under the condition of a paternity test, and upon finding out he's not the father, he asked her to leave. The question is whether he was wrong to do that.\n\nPossible angles to consider: legal responsibility, moral responsibility, emotional state, and the child's well-being. Legally, if he's not the biological father, he might not have legal obligations towards the child. However, if he had been acting as a parent, there might be different considerations. But in this case, he found out he wasn't the father after agreeing to let her stay temporarily.\n\nMorally, some might argue that once he found out about the pregnancy, he had a responsibility to support the child regardless of paternity. However, others might say that he was betrayed (cheating) and has the right to step back, especially since he wasn't the biological father. The emotional toll on him is also a factor\u2014he was already stressed from the breakup and financial strain.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: she cheated, then asked him to support a child that isn't his. The man felt betrayed, which could justify his decision. However, the child is a separate entity, and some might argue that the man should still provide support to ensure the child's well-being, regardless of his relationship with the mother.\n\nAnother angle is the initial conditions. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of the paternity test, which she accepted. So, once the test was done and he found out he wasn't the father, he fulfilled the agreement. The decision to leave was mutual after the test. However, the issue is whether he should still support the unborn child despite not being the father.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are pressuring him to take her back, which might complicate things. But his personal feelings and emotional state are valid. He's going through a lot, and the betrayal from cheating and the financial burden could contribute to his decision.\n\nIn terms of fairness to the unborn child, some might say that the child's needs should come first, but the man is not the father. Unless he has a legal or prior commitment, he might not be obligated. However, if he had been acting as a parent before the test, there might be moral expectations. Since he found out after agreeing to let her stay, maybe he didn't have the same responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether non-biological fathers have a moral obligation. In some societies or personal ethics, people might feel responsible for a child they thought was theirs. But if it's a legal matter, and he's not the father, then maybe not. The key is that the man was not the father, and he had made that a condition for his support. After the test, his obligation ended. However, the emotional aspect and societal pressure might make some people think he should still help. But legally and morally, if he's not the father and wasn't previously involved, it's less clear.\n\nThe answer options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no). Considering all factors, the man is not in the wrong because he didn't have a legal obligation and the agreement was contingent on paternity. So answer B.\n"
