It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given post is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after discovering the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his ex were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading him to break up. She moved in with her parents, but they had issues (her mom smokes a lot). He let her stay with him again, but insisted on a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now she's with friends, and mutual friends are telling him he's wrong to not support her and the child.\n\nSo the main question here is about the author's responsibility towards the child. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to provide financial support. Emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. The user is conflicted because he feels emotionally raw and there's pressure from friends to \"take care of them.\" \n\nFactors to consider: The author had a prior agreement for the paternity test. Once he found out it wasn't his, he felt a betrayal (since she might have known earlier and lied). His decision to ask her to leave was based on the test results and his own emotional state. The ex is staying with friends to avoid the harmful environment at her parents' house. \n\nPossible angles: On one hand, he's not the biological father, so he's within his rights to leave. On the other hand, some might argue that once he agreed to support her during the pregnancy, he should follow through regardless of the test. But since the test was part of the agreement, maybe he wasn't obligated beyond that point. \n\nAlso, her friends and mutual ones might be projecting their own views on what's right, but the author is dealing with the aftermath of a cheating partner and financial strain. He's not in a position where he's refusing help; he allowed her to stay temporarily but with the condition. After the test, he felt justified in ending the arrangement. \n\nSo, legally and based on the agreement, he's not in the wrong. Emotionally, it's tough, but he's also protecting himself from potential future obligations. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any moral obligation or if the action was justified given the circumstances. The user is asking if he's a \"terrible person,\" which depends on perspective. If he's not the father, then maybe he's not responsible for the child's care. The ex's friends might be conflating the unborn child's well-being with the mother's, but the author isn't the father. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong since the child isn't his, and he had a prior condition. It's reasonable for him to withdraw support after the test results.\n"
