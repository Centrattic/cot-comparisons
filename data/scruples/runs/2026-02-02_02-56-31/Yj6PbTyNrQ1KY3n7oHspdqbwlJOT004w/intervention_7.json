  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the user is a guy who had a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. They broke up because she was unemployed, not looking for work, and he suspected her of cheating. After the breakup, she comes back saying she's pregnant, and he lets her stay, agreeing to a paternity test. The test shows the child isn't his. He then kicks her out. Now, people are telling him he's wrong for not helping her and the child.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is he wrong for doing that?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support it. Legally, he's not the father. But emotionally and ethically, it's more complicated. He was tricked into thinking he was the father, and then found out it's someone else's child. He's dealing with the pain of a breakup, suspected cheating, and betrayal. \n\nHe might feel that the mother is responsible for providing for her child, especially since he's not the biological father. However, the mother is pregnant, which is a vulnerable time, and people might argue that he should still help her out of compassion.\n\nBut then again, he's been through a lot. The ex cheated, and she's now putting him in a position where he might feel responsible for someone else's child. He's emotionally raw, which might influence his decision. \n\nOn the other side, some might say that even if he's not the father, he might still have a moral obligation to support her, especially if she's in a bad situation. The fact that she's staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking shows she's in a vulnerable situation. People might argue that he should use his home to help her, regardless of the child's parentage.\n\nBut another angle is that he's not obligated to help someone else's child. The ex is the mother, and she's responsible for her own child. He was deceived into thinking he was the father, and now that the truth is out, he's justified in not wanting to be involved. The cheaters often have to deal with the consequences, and in this case, she's the one who cheated by having a child with someone else while in a relationship.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of emotional support. Even if he's not the father, maybe he should still help her through the pregnancy, given that she's in a tough spot. But he's also dealing with his own emotional trauma from the breakup and the betrayal.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n- Legal obligation: None, since he's not the father.\n\n- Emotional and moral obligations: Debatable. Some might argue he should help, others might say he's justified in not wanting to.\n\n- The ex's actions: Cheating, leading to the pregnancy. She's the parent responsible.\n\n- His emotional state: It's a tough time for him, and he might be justified in prioritizing his own well-being.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer might hinge on personal ethics. If he feels he's not responsible, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if people are pressuring him to help regardless, it's a moral dilemma. However, legally and in terms of personal responsibility, he might be in the right. So, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
