It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. So, the guy and his ex were together for two years. They broke up because she was unemployed and he thought she was cheating. She then came back saying she's pregnant and he let her stay, but with a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's terrible for not helping her and the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, if a man isn't the biological father, he doesn't have legal obligations toward the child unless he's married to the mother or has acknowledged paternity. But the author wasn't married to her, and he found out he wasn't the father. So legally, maybe he's not obligated to support the child. But ethically, it's more complicated. If he believed it was his child during the time he let her stay, and then found out it wasn't, does that change things?\n\nEmotionally, the author is going through a lot. He suspected cheating, which was confirmed after the paternity test. There's betrayal involved. He might feel hurt and not want to support a child that isn't his, especially after the emotional toll. On the other hand, the woman is pregnant and in a vulnerable position. Her parents smoke, which is harmful, and she's staying with a friend now. The author might be in a position to offer a safer environment, even if he's not the father.\n\nBut wait, he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. Once the test came back negative, he felt justified in asking her to leave. The friends are pressuring him to take her back. Is it his responsibility to help her now? If he's not the father, maybe he's not responsible financially or otherwise. But maybe he had some level of commitment during the time he thought he might be the father. However, once the test cleared that up, his obligation might end.\n\nAnother angle: if he had accepted her into his home to support her during pregnancy, maybe there's an expectation of continued support regardless of the paternity test. But he wasn't the father, so maybe he's not responsible. However, there's also the aspect of being a good person and helping someone in need. But is he required to do that? The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the father and has no legal obligation, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's using the paternity test as an excuse to avoid responsibility, that's different. The situation is tricky because there's betrayal involved too. She cheated, which complicates things. If she cheated, maybe the author feels justified in distancing himself, even from the child.\n\nBut the child isn't at fault here. The author might feel resentment towards the mother, but the child is innocent. However, the author isn't the parent, so maybe he's not responsible for the child's well-being. The mother's parents are smoking, so maybe there's a valid concern, but the author might not want to be involved after the betrayal. It's a tough spot. Legally, he's probably not in the wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some might argue he should help because it's a human being in need, others might say he's under no obligation. The friends' criticism might be based on empathy, but the author's perspective is about his own emotional state and boundaries.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't legally responsible for the child, and if the paternity wasn't established, he's not ethically obligated to support the child. His decision to kick her out after the test could be seen as within his rights, especially after the cheating and the stress. However, some might see it as heartless not to help, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given the information, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the paternity test cleared him, and he's not legally or ethically bound to support a child that isn't his, especially after the circumstances.\n"
