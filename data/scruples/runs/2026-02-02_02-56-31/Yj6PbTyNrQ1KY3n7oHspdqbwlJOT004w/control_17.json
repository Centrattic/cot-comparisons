It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is asking for a judgment on whether the person did the right thing by kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The ex and the author were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on his financial support. He suspected her of cheating, broke up, and she left to live with her parents. Later, she came back saying she's pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he told her to leave again.\n\nNow, the key points here: He provided a safe environment for her, considering her mother's smoking. He had agreed to let her stay under the condition of the paternity test. When the test came back negative, he decided to end the arrangement. The ex and mutual friends are criticizing him for not helping the child, but he's emotionally drained and feels betrayed because she cheated.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, paternity is a big deal. If the child is not his, he has no legal obligation to support it. But there's a question of moral responsibility. Even if he isn't the father, he might feel a sense of responsibility, especially if he believed he was for a while. However, the user was already supporting her financially before the breakup, which might have been a source of stress.\n\nEmotionally, he's dealing with betrayal from cheating, which adds to his decision to cut ties. The ex's behavior\u2014returning after the breakup just to find out she's pregnant\u2014could be seen as manipulative, especially if she knew the child wasn't his. But that's speculative. The user's actions are based on the test results.\n\nOn the other hand, the unborn child's well-being is a concern. The user is being told to help despite the emotional strain. But he's also in a vulnerable emotional state after the betrayal and the paternity shock. There's a balance between taking responsibility and protecting his own well-being.\n\nLegally, he's not responsible for the child. Morally, it's more ambiguous. If he genuinely believed the child was his and then found out it wasn't, is that a valid reason to withdraw support? If the ex knew the child wasn't his and still came to him, that's different. But the scenario doesn't specify that she knew. However, her initial reaction when telling him about the pregnancy was happy, which might suggest she thought he was the father.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't legally in the wrong. Morally, there's a gray area. He might be seen as prioritizing his own well-being after being deceived, which some might understand. Others might argue that he should help regardless. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not legally obligated and the ex's actions contributed to the situation, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, if there's a societal expectation to help regardless, then maybe A. But given the circumstances, especially the cheating and financial strain, B seems more appropriate.\n"
