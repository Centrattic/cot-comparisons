It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The man was in a 2-year relationship, but it became rocky when his girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up with her. She later came back, claiming she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed the child wasn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here: The man had a valid reason to be upset. He was supporting her financially when they were together, and the relationship was already strained. She cheated on him, which he later confirmed. The paternity test revealed the child isn't his, so he's not obligated to support another man's child. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he has no legal responsibility. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and the stress of possibly being a father, which adds to his turmoil. His decision to ask her to leave might stem from a need to protect himself from further emotional harm, especially after the cheating and the financial burden.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman is pregnant and in a vulnerable state. Moving her out might leave her without support, especially if her parents are smokers. The mutual friends argue that he should help the child, but if the child isn't his, the obligation isn't there. However, there's a moral question about supporting the mother regardless of paternity.\n\nBut the man had set the condition for the paternity test upfront. She agreed, and once the result was known, he followed through. He's not in a position to be forced to support someone else's child. His emotional state is also valid; after betrayal and stress, he needs to prioritize his own well-being.\n\nSo, considering the facts, the man isn't in the wrong. He acted within his rights and the agreed-upon terms. It's not his responsibility to take care of another man's child, especially after the relationship ended on bad terms. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
