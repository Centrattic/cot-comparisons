It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after a paternity test showed he's not the father. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the ex was with him for two years, and they broke up because she was unemployed and he suspected her of cheating. After the breakup, she came back saying she was pregnant. He let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. They did the test, and it turned out the child isn't his. Then he asked her to leave. Now, mutual friends and others are saying he's a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nSo, the author is conflicted. He's feeling emotional and is being criticized for not taking care of the child. The key points here are consent, responsibility, and emotional state. He agreed to let her stay on the condition of a paternity test, and once it was done, he realized he wasn't the father. Legally, there's no obligation for him to take care of someone else's child. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, and the betrayal of the pregnancy not being his. \n\nBut does that make it right to kick her out? Well, she's an adult and capable of making her own decisions. However, the child's well-being is a factor. The author might be avoiding responsibility, but since he's not the father, he doesn't have legal duty. However, morally, some might argue that he should support her because she's in a vulnerable state. But others might say he's not responsible for someone else's child, especially after finding out the truth.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him a bad person, but the author is struggling with his feelings. The main question is whether he was wrong. Legally, no. Morally, it's a gray area. Some people might say he's justified in wanting to protect himself after the betrayal and financial burden, while others might say he's abandoning someone in need. However, considering he set a condition for staying (paternity test) and followed through, his actions were based on the test results. He's not obligated to help, but his emotional state and the circumstances might make it a complex situation. Overall, the answer hinges on whether legal obligation is the main factor, and in that case, he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
