It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading to financial strain. The author suspected cheating and broke up, then she moved to her parents. Later, she came back saying she's pregnant, and he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test shows the child isn't his, so he kicks her out. Now, friends are criticizing him for not helping the child.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Did he have a reasonable reason to kick her out? The paternity test was a condition he set, and once that wasn't met, he followed through. He claims she cheated, which adds betrayal. The woman is now single and pregnant, and the author is being pressured to take her in despite the emotional trauma he's experienced.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless there's a legal obligation, the author isn't responsible for the child. Emotionally, he's been through a breakup, suspected cheating, financial stress, and now betrayal. His decision might stem from protecting himself from further emotional turmoil. However, the child's well-being is a concern. But the author isn't the father, so his responsibility isn't automatic.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once he knew the child was vulnerable, he should help regardless. But the author's mental health and past experiences with the partner (cheating, financial issues) could justify his decision. He's not legally bound, and his emotional state is valid. Friends' opinions might not consider the depth of his betrayal and the stress he's under.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong because the child isn't his, and he had legitimate reasons for setting the paternity test as a condition. His decision to leave when that condition wasn't met is a personal choice. The emotional impact on the child is a factor, but the author isn't the parent here. He's choosing to prioritize his own well-being after being hurt. While it's a tough choice, it's not necessarily wrong.\n"
