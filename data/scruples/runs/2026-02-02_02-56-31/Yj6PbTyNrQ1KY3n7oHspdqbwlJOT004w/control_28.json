It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after kicking out his pregnant girlfriend when he found out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his ex had a two-year relationship. The last few months were tough because she lost her job, stopped looking for work, and relied on him financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back pregnant, claiming it was his. He let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed it wasn't his, he kicked her out. Now, people are criticizing him for being a bad person.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author allowed her to stay under the condition of a paternity test. Once the test proved the child isn't his, he ended the arrangement. He had already broken up with her before the pregnancy. The cheating was confirmed, which adds to his emotional state. He's feeling overwhelmed and doesn't want to take care of the child.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to provide support unless he's been acting as a father. If he wasn't the biological father and wasn't recognized as the legal parent, then he's not legally responsible. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, betrayal. His decision might be seen as self-preservation.\n\nBut there's also the ethical angle. Even if it's not his child, some might argue that he should help out of compassion. However, he's not responsible for the child's well-being if he's not the parent. The ex knew the condition of the paternity test, so she agreed to it. The author's actions were based on the test results, which were clear. \n\nThe mutual friends and her friends are pressuring him, but their opinion might not consider the full context of their relationship's breakdown. The author's emotional state is valid; he's been through a lot and is doing what he feels is right for himself.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he followed through on the agreed-upon condition of the paternity test. He's not the child's father, and there's no legal obligation. His decision to leave is based on factual information and his own emotional needs. So, the answer should be B.\n"
