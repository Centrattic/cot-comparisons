It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking whether the person who kicked their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs was wrong. The situation involves a two-year relationship that ended because the girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, plus suspected cheating. The guy broke up, but when she came back pregnant, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child, and he's conflicted.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The author broke up with his girlfriend, who then got pregnant and came back, assuming he was the father. He agreed to let her stay to avoid her smoking parents. They did a paternity test, which proved he's not the father. Then he asked her to leave, and now she's with friends instead of her parents. The main question is whether his action of asking her to leave was wrong.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, responsibility, and the legal/ethical implications. Since the child isn't his, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support it. However, the moral argument is that he might feel responsible because he was led to believe he's the father. But once the paternity is proven negative, his responsibility might be considered lifted.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the relationship. The breakup was due to her not working and suspected cheating. If she cheated, then the child's father could be someone else. The author isn't obligated to support a child that isn't his, especially if there's a history of infidelity and financial strain.\n\nHowever, there's a social component where friends are pressuring him to take her and the child in. That's a common scenario where people expect support regardless of the circumstances. But legally, he's not the father, so he's not required to provide support. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and the stress of the situation. He might be justified in prioritizing his own well-being, especially if he's been through a lot.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even if he's not the legal father, he might feel a moral obligation to help out, but that's a personal choice. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not doing so. Since he was deceived about being the father and the relationship had already ended with valid reasons (job loss, cheating), his decision to cut ties after the paternity test is a reasonable step. He's not obligated to support someone else's child, especially after the betrayal.\n\nSo, considering all angles\u2014legal, emotional, and ethical\u2014it seems the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a decision based on the proven facts and his own circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
