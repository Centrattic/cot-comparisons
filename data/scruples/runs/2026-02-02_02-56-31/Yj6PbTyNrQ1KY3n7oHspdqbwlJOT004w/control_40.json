It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend when the paternity test showed the child wasn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The man and his ex were together for two years. The relationship had issues, especially when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, making him support them both. He suspected cheating, and then he broke up with her, and she left to stay with her parents.\n\nBut then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and they did the test. Turns out the child isn't his. So he tells her to leave. Now, she and others are saying he's a bad person for not supporting her and the child, even though her mom smokes a lot. He's feeling torn between his emotional state and the pressure to help.\n\nSo, the main points here: the man discovered after a test that he's not the biological father of his ex's child. He was already in a breakup situation with trust issues. He allowed her to stay under the condition of the test, and when it turned out negative, he asked her to leave. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nI should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, the biological father has rights, but so does the mother and any legal guardians. However, the man here is not the biological father, so his responsibility towards the child isn't automatically legal. But ethically, if he was in a relationship and believed the child was his, would he have a different case? But in this case, he had a test to confirm, so the assumption was cleared. \n\nThe woman cheated, which is a betrayal. The man was already emotionally hurt from the breakup and the possible financial burden. He might feel that after the betrayal, he's not willing to take responsibility for a child that isn't his. Also, he was concerned about the child's environment, which is why he let her stay initially. But once the paternity was clear, maybe he felt the child isn't his, so he's not obligated to take care of them.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that even if the child isn't biologically his, the man could have a responsibility if he was in a committed relationship and believed the child was his. But he took the proactive step of getting a paternity test, which shows he wanted to confirm. Once he knew it wasn't his, he might have felt justified in leaving, especially considering the cheating and the financial strain. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional state of the woman. Being pregnant and having to move out again could be stressful for her, especially if she's staying with a friend. But she had the choice to go to her parents, and the man's home was part of the arrangement. However, the man's mental health and well-being are also important. After the emotional turmoil, he might not be in a place to handle another potential emotional burden.\n\nSo, the key factors are: he let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. Once it was clear he wasn't the father, he asked her to leave. The woman and her supporters are criticizing him for not helping now. Legally, he's not the father, so he's not obligated. Ethically, it's more complicated. If he had been supportive during the pregnancy, even without being the father, some might say it's noble. But he felt betrayed and was already dealing with a breakup and financial stress. \n\nI think the man isn't in the wrong because he made an agreement to confirm paternity, and once that was done, he followed through. The child isn't his, and he's not responsible for someone else's child. His decision is personal and based on his emotional state and the circumstances of the relationship. However, some might argue that in a committed relationship, he could have a moral obligation. But since the test cleared that, and he had already ended the relationship, B for No seems appropriate.\n"
