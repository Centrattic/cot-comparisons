  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who kicked out their pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his was in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the man and his ex were together for two years. The relationship got rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he had to support them both. He suspected she was cheating, which led him to break up with her. She went to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and they did the test. The result was that the child isn't his, so he told her to leave. Now, she's staying with a friend, and their mutual friends are saying he's wrong for not helping.\n\nSo, the main question is: Was he wrong to kick her out?\n\nLet me think about the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, in many places, a man is not the legal father unless he is married to the mother or has signed the birth certificate, which he didn't. Since the test showed he's not the father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. But ethically, people might argue different things.\n\nHe had already broken up with her before the pregnancy. She came back to him because her parents' environment wasn't good for the pregnancy. He offered help under the condition of a paternity test, which she agreed to. Once he found out he wasn't the father, he decided to cut ties. He's feeling emotionally raw due to the cheating and the financial strain. The mutual friends are pressuring him to help, but he's conflicted.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, some might say that even if he's not the biological father, he might feel a sense of responsibility. However, others might argue that he's under no obligation and that he's been treated poorly in the relationship. The woman cheated, and he had to support her financially, which added to his stress. Also, the fact that she knew about the paternity test condition before staying with him again suggests she was aware of the possibility of him not being the father.\n\nBut then, after the test, she's the mother, and the child is her responsibility. He's not legally bound to help, and his emotional state is a factor. The friends might be using emotional arguments about the child's well-being, but if the mother can stay with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking, maybe the child isn't in immediate danger. There's also the aspect of his own mental health and capacity to handle the situation after everything that's happened.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he should have considered the child's well-being more, regardless of legalities. But since he's not the father, that's a different scenario. It's possible he's being pressured by society to take on a role he's not legally or biologically bound to. Plus, the woman had the choice to seek other forms of support, like government assistance or family help.\n\nSo, putting it all together, legally he's not in the wrong, and ethically, given the circumstances of the relationship breakdown and the test result, he's not obligated to help. The mutual friends' opinions don't change the fact that he's not the father. Therefore, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong (B).\n"
