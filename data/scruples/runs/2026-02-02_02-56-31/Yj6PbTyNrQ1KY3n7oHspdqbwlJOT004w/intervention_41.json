  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong to kick their pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't theirs. Let's look at the key points here.\n\nFirst, they were in a 2-year relationship that ended because the ex wasn't working and was living off them, plus suspected cheating. The ex then came back saying she's pregnant, and they agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't theirs, so they asked her to leave. Now friends are saying they're being cruel, but the user is conflicted.\n\nSo, the main legal and ethical issues here are paternity, responsibility, and emotional state. Legally, if the paternity test confirms he's not the father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. However, there might be moral or social pressures, especially if he's been acting like a supportive partner up until the test.\n\nEmotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and the stress of a possible fatherhood. The ex cheated, which adds to his feelings of betrayal. But the user is also being criticized for not helping, which raises questions about his responsibility towards the child even if he's not the biological father.\n\nIn many places, if someone is not the biological father and there's no legal acknowledgment, they aren't required to provide financial support. However, if there's any legal paternity established (like through signing the birth certificate or otherwise), there might be obligations. Since the test showed he's not the father, legally he's off the hook. \n\nBut socially, people might expect him to help, especially if he was leading her on, thinking he was the father. If he had already started providing support or making plans, there might be ethical considerations. However, in this case, he set the condition of a paternity test before agreeing to support her. She agreed, so once the test showed he wasn't the father, he's fulfilling that agreement by not supporting.\n\nThe user's actions might be seen as protecting himself after discovering the betrayal. Cheating and financial strain are significant stressors. The ex's friends arguing he should help might not consider the emotional toll and the fact that he's not the father. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the unborn child's well-being. Even if he's not the father, there's a moral argument to consider the child's needs. But since he's not legally obligated and he's already broken up with the mother, he's within his rights to choose not to be involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together, legally there's no wrong in his actions. Ethically, it's more gray. If he had committed to supporting her under the belief he was the father, there might be more responsibility. But since he set a condition for the test first, and she agreed, he's acting according to their prior agreement. The emotional aspect is complex, but he's not in the wrong legally or ethically based on the information given.\n"
