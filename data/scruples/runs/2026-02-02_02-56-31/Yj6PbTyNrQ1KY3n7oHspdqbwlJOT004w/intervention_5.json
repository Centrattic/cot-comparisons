  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking their pregnant ex out when the child isn't theirs. Hmm.\n\nFirst, they were in a two-year relationship. The ex lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and they broke up. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant and asks to stay. He agrees but wants a paternity test. The test shows it's not his. He kicks her out. Now she and friends are calling him a bad person.\n\nSo, the key points here are legal and ethical. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support them. But ethically, maybe people think he should help because he was the father he thought he was. But he found out it's not his, so maybe he's not responsible. Also, she cheated, which is betrayal. The user is emotionally raw. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the biological father, then he's not legally responsible. However, some might argue that once you get involved emotionally and financially, you might have some responsibility. But if the paternity test cleared that, then maybe not. Also, the user wasn't in a committed relationship when the child was conceived if they had broken up before she got pregnant. Wait, they broke up before she got pregnant? Let me check: she left after the breakup, then came back saying she was pregnant. So the child was conceived after the breakup? Or before? If the breakup was a few weeks before she came back, maybe the pregnancy was during the breakup period. But paternity tests show he's not the father. \n\nSo legally, if the child is not his, he doesn't have to support them. Emotionally, maybe he felt connected, but once the truth came out, he's justified in not wanting to stay. The ex cheated, which adds to the betrayal. The user might feel manipulated into staying. \n\nBut the user's question is about being in the wrong. If he's not the father, then he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that he should still help her because he was supportive before the test. But I think the key is that he had the test done as a condition. If she was honest from the start and he agreed to the test, then his decision after the test is valid. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
