It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was together for two years but had issues in the last few months. The girlfriend lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading the author to break up. She then showed up pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. After the test revealed the child wasn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, a man isn't automatically the legal father unless there's a court order or he's listed on the birth certificate. So maybe the author isn't legally obligated to support the child. However, the moral side is trickier. The girlfriend cheated, which is a betrayal, but the child is innocent. The author is dealing with emotional turmoil and betrayal, which might affect his decision.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of the child's well-being. Even if the father isn't the author, the child might be in a vulnerable situation. The girlfriend's mother smokes, so the author initially took her in to protect the child from that. Now that the child isn't his, is he still responsible? Or does his responsibility end because the child isn't his? \n\nAlso, the author is being criticized by friends and the girlfriend for not providing a home. Society often places pressure on men to take responsibility for children they believe are theirs, but if the paternity test proves otherwise, maybe that pressure lessens. However, the author's own emotional state is a factor. He's been through a breakup, potential cheating, and now this revelation. \n\nBut there's a risk that the child could be in a harmful environment if the author doesn't help. Even if it's not his child, if the mother is in a situation where the child's safety is compromised (like exposure to smoke), maybe he still has an ethical duty to help. However, the mother could seek other support systems. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, no. Morally, it's debatable. If the child is in danger, maybe he should help regardless. But if the mother is capable of providing for the child in a safe environment, maybe not. The author might be justified in his decision given the betrayal and the paternity test results. However, if the child is in jeopardy, perhaps he has a moral obligation despite the personal pain. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering all factors, the author isn't legally obligated, and the child isn't his. However, the moral responsibility part is subjective. The community might judge him harshly, but if the mother can provide for the child safely, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. On the other hand, if the child is in a harmful situation, the author might be neglecting potential responsibility. The situation is complex, but based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong if there's no legal obligation and the mother is able to care for the child. So the answer is B.\n"
