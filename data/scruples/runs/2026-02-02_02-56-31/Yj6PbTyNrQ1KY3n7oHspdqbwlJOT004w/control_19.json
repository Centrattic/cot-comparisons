It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author had a 2-year relationship with his ex, which ended because she lost her job and wasn't contributing, plus he suspected her of cheating. She left, but later came back saying she was pregnant. He agreed to let her stay again, mainly because her mom smokes, and they arranged a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person, and he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the paternity test result and the author's decision based on that. If the child isn't his, then he has no legal or moral obligation to support it. However, some might argue that once he agreed to let her stay and get the test, he might have some responsibility regardless of the result. But if the test proves the child isn't his, then his initial assumption was incorrect, and he's not obligated to continue helping.\n\nHe mentions she cheated, which adds to his betrayal. His emotional state is a factor\u2014feeling raw and overwhelmed. Legally, since the child isn't his, he isn't responsible. But maybe there's a moral argument if he had already committed to helping, regardless of the test result. However, he set a condition of getting a paternity test, and she agreed. So once that condition was met, and the result was negative, he might feel justified in ending the arrangement.\n\nOthers are pressuring him to take her back, but that's their opinion. He's conflicted because he's been through a lot. The main issue is whether he's morally wrong for not supporting a child that isn't his. Since he's not the biological father, he's not legally responsible. Morally, if he had known the child wasn't his, he might not feel a duty. However, some might argue that once he got involved, he should still help. But given the circumstances\u2014cheating, financial burden, and the paternity test\u2014his decision could be seen as reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if he had prior knowledge and still let her stay, but he did set the paternity test as a condition. So, he's not at fault for making that decision after the test results. Therefore, B is the answer.\n"
