  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. So, first, the key points here are: the girlfriend had been with him for two years, the relationship was rocky, he suspected cheating, broke up, then she came back pregnant. They agreed to a paternity test, the test came back negative, and he asked her to leave. Now others are criticizing him for not helping.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support the child. Legally, that makes sense. But ethically, it's more complicated. He supported her financially when he thought the child was his, but now that he knows it's not, he's not responsible. But there's the emotional aspect. He's been through a lot, the cheating was confirmed, and he's feeling raw. The girlfriend and others are saying he should help for the child's sake.\n\nThe user is conflicted because he feels like maybe he should take responsibility despite the betrayal. But he's also justified in not wanting to support a child he's not related to. The cheating is a major factor here\u2014trust was broken. If she cheated, that's a valid reason for the breakup. However, now the situation is about supporting an unrelated child. \n\nIn terms of fairness to the unborn child, the user isn't the biological parent, so he's not legally a father. However, society might expect some level of support if the mother is in need. But he's already struggling emotionally. It's a tough spot. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. Legally, no. Ethically, it's a gray area. But given the circumstances of cheating and confirmed betrayal, he's justified in walking away. So, answer B.\n"
