It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were wrong to kick their pregnant ex out after a paternity test showed the child isn't theirs. They had a two-year relationship that ended because the ex was unemployed and possibly cheating. The user took her back after the pregnancy news but insisted on a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he made her leave. Now he's being criticized for being a bad person, and he's conflicted.\n\nFirst, legal obligations. Legally, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he's not legally responsible for the child. So he's under no obligation to support the child financially or provide a home. That's a key point. But then there's the emotional and ethical side. He was led to believe the child was his, so maybe he felt a moral responsibility initially. But once the test cleared that, his responsibility might shift. \n\nThe ex cheated on him, which adds to his betrayal. He's been through a lot emotionally, and the sudden change from expecting to be a father to being a third party must be tough. His decision to ask her to leave could be seen as self-preservation. However, the child is still a human being, and the user might feel conflicted about not supporting an innocent child. But the child isn't his, so maybe his responsibility is to himself and his mental health here.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that once you're involved in a relationship and a child is born, you have a moral duty regardless of paternity. But since the test proved he's not the father, that duty might not apply. The ex's friends are pressuring him to take her back, but that's their opinion. He needs to consider his own well-being. \n\nHe did agree to the paternity test, so he took the responsible step. The problem is the emotional fallout. He's feeling guilty, which is normal, but he has to decide what's right for him. If there's no legal responsibility, and the relationship ended due to cheating, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he feels a moral obligation to help, it's a personal choice, not a legal one. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he's not responsible. Emotionally, it's a tough spot, but his actions are understandable given the betrayal and lack of paternity. Therefore, the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
