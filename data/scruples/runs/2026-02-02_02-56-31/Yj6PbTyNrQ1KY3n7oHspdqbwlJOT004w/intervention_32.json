It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out because the child wasn't his. They were together for two years, but things got rocky. She lost her job, didn't look for work, and he suspected cheating. He broke up with her, she went to live with her parents. Then she comes back pregnant, he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test comes back negative, so he kicks her out. Now, mutual friends are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support the child. However, there might be ethical considerations about helping an innocent child. But he might argue that he was taken advantage of emotionally and financially. He had already broken up with her, and she came back with the pregnancy news, making him believe he was the father. When it turned out he wasn't, his feelings of betrayal and emotional trauma could justify his reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, even though the child isn't his, the woman is still in a vulnerable position, and he might feel a moral responsibility to help her, regardless of their past issues. Some people might argue that once a person is in a relationship and a child is involved, there's a certain duty to support the mother, even if the father isn't involved. But since the child isn't his, maybe he's within his rights to walk away. However, the emotional impact on the child in the future could be a factor too\u2014if he cuts ties completely, the child might struggle growing up without a father figure, but that's more of a long-term consideration.\n\nHe also mentions that she cheated, which adds to his emotional distress. It's possible that she used the pregnancy as a way to get back into his life, knowing he might feel obligated to stay. That could be seen as manipulation. But then again, the woman is pregnant and might have her own reasons for wanting his support, even if the child isn't his.\n\nAnother angle is the paternity test. He set a condition for the test, she agreed, so there was an understanding that the outcome might change their arrangement. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he felt justified in ending the living arrangement. That seems fair if both parties agreed to the terms beforehand. However, some might argue that he should have considered the woman's situation more, regardless of the test result, given her pregnancy.\n\nThe friends' opinions are that he's being cruel to the child, but the child isn't his. It's not his child, so maybe the friends are conflating the woman's situation with the child's. His home is his, and he's entitled to his own space, especially after the emotional turmoil. But maybe there's a societal expectation that a man should support a woman in her pregnancy regardless of paternity, which he's not meeting here.\n\nIn terms of fairness, he wasn't in the wrong when the child isn't his. The key issue is whether he has a moral obligation beyond the legal one. If he feels emotionally unable to help, perhaps it's not his fault. But some might say that compassion requires him to assist regardless. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and legally he's not obligated, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a gray area here because of the ethical considerations of helping someone in need.\n"
