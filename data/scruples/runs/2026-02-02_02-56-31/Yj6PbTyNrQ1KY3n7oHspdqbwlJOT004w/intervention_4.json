  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking out their pregnant ex-girlfriend after a paternity test showed the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship that ended because the ex wasn't working and was financially dependent. The user suspected cheating, broke up, but then she came back saying she was pregnant. They agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the baby isn't his, he told her to leave.\n\nHe's now being criticized by friends and others for not supporting her and the child. He's feeling torn between his emotional state and possible responsibility.\n\nLegal perspective: Legally, if the paternity test proves he's not the biological father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. But maybe there's more to consider if he was led to believe he was the father and acted accordingly.\n\nEmotional and ethical angle: The ex cheated, which is a betrayal. The user might feel wronged and not want to support a child not biologically his. However, some might argue that regardless of the biological relation, if he was supportive during pregnancy, he might feel a moral obligation.\n\nSocial pressure: Friends are telling him to take care of the child. But his mental health and well-being are also important, especially since he's been through emotional turmoil.\n\nKey points: The user didn't know about the pregnancy when they broke up, he agreed to take her back with the condition of a paternity test, and once it was proven the child wasn't his, he ended the arrangement. The ex's actions (cheating, financial dependency) contributed to the breakup initially.\n\nPossible outcomes: Legally, he's not responsible. Emotionally, it's a tough spot. The user might be justified in his decision, especially after the cheating and the test results. However, some might argue that supporting an unborn child is a moral duty regardless of paternity.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might be B, as he's not legally obligated and the ex's actions (cheating, financial dependency) and test results support his decision. But it's a complex situation with emotional nuances.\n"
