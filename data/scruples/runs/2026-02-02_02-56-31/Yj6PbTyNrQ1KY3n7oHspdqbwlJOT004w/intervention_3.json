  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were wrong to kick out their pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship, it was rocky with financial issues and suspected cheating leading to a breakup. She left, came back pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, mutual friends and her side are criticizing him for not supporting the child.\n\nThe key points here are legal and emotional. Legally, paternity is determined by the test, so he's not the father. Emotionally, he's been through a lot: cheated on, financial strain, and now dealing with the aftermath. But the ex is pregnant, and even though the child isn't his, she's still in a vulnerable state. \n\nThe user is questioning if he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's not responsible for the child since he's not the father. However, morally and ethically, some might argue that he should still help because she's his ex and they were in a relationship. But others might say he's not obligated to help, especially after cheating and the relationship ending. \n\nBut here's the catch: even if he isn't the father, she's still pregnant and needs support. If he's in a position to help (financially, emotionally), maybe he should consider that. However, he's also under emotional stress and the betrayal is fresh. Friends are pressuring him to take her back, but that might not be fair to him either.\n\nThe problem is that he's being blamed for not wanting to support a child that isn't his. But legally and ethically, if he's not the father, his obligation is not the same. However, in some cultures or social circles, there's an expectation to help even if not the father, especially if you were in a relationship. But that's more of a social norm than a legal one.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not the father, then he's not legally responsible. Emotionally, maybe he's struggling with guilt or feeling obligated, but he's not in the wrong for choosing his own well-being. The ex cheated, which adds to the betrayal. But the unborn child is still a person in need, though not his biological child. \n\nIn terms of morality, there's a debate. Some might say it's unfair to him to take on responsibility he didn't agree to, especially after being cheated on. Others might argue that he should have considered the possibility before the paternity test and that now he should help regardless. However, since the test cleared him, he's not in the wrong for not assuming responsibility. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but with the nuance that while he's not obligated, there's a moral choice to help if he can, but he's not wrong for choosing not to.\n"
