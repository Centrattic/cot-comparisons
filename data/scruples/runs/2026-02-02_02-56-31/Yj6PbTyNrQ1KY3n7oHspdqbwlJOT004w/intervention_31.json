  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex when he found out the child isn't his. First, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nHe mentions they had a two-year relationship that ended because he suspected cheating and she was unemployed, leading him to break up. Then she comes back pregnant, he agrees to let her stay but insists on a paternity test. When the test shows it's not his, he kicks her out. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping.\n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, emotional turmoil. But he also chose to let her stay under the assumption it was his child, so there's some responsibility there. However, once the paternity is confirmed, maybe he's justified in not wanting to take care of someone else's kid. \n\nBut there's a moral angle too. The child is innocent. Even though he didn't cause the pregnancy, he might feel a connection, especially if he was led to believe it was his. Also, the ex might be in a vulnerable position, and he could be seen as abandoning her. However, he's under no legal obligation. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is about moral responsibility, maybe he's not wrong legally but could be seen as morally wrong. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong in general. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nConsidering all factors, he's not legally at fault. Emotionally, he's struggling, and he's made a decision based on the truth of the paternity. However, others might judge him for not helping. But the question is about right and wrong. Since he's not legally obligated and the child isn't his, the answer might be B. But maybe there's a moral responsibility. It's tricky. I think the answer is B because he's not legally in the wrong, and he made the decision based on confirmed information. But some might argue he should help regardless. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just opinion. So I'll go with B.\n"
