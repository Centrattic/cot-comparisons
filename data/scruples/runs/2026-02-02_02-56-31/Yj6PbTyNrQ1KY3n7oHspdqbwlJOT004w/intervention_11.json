It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking out their pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the context: They were together for two years, then she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading him to break up. She went to live with her parents but came back pregnant, claiming the child was his. He agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. The test proved he's not the father, so he asked her to leave. Now, she and others are criticizing him for not helping.\n\nHe's feeling torn between his emotional state and the pressure from friends. The key points here are the paternity test result, the prior breakup, her possible cheating, and the sudden responsibility shift.\n\nLegally, if he's not the biological father, he's not obligated to support the child. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and the stress of a pregnancy that wasn't his. However, the child is involved, and there's a debate about his responsibility towards an innocent child. \n\nBut wait, he did agree to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. Once the test came back negative, he felt justified in asking her to leave. But the question is whether that action was wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that he has a responsibility to support the mother and child, even if he's not the father, especially since he allowed her to stay in his home. Others might say that since he's not the father and the relationship was already broken, he's not obligated. \n\nThe emotional aspect is significant. He's been through a lot, and the betrayal adds to his stress. However, the child's well-being is a factor. But since he's not the father, his legal responsibility ends there. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would hinge on whether he's morally obligated beyond being the biological father. If the community or friends are pressuring him, but legally he's not bound, it's a personal choice. However, kicking her out after agreeing to let her stay might be seen as unfair, even if the paternity test was a condition. \n\nBut the main point is that he followed through on his condition. If she agreed to the test and he provided a safe environment, then upon the test result, he's within his rights to ask her to leave. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
