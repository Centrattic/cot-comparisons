It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the person kicking out their pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The ex and the author were in a 2-year relationship. It was rocky because the ex lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so the author was supporting them both. The author suspected cheating and broke up, leading the ex to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, the author kicked her out. Now, others are saying he's being unfair, but he's feeling torn.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author wrong for not taking care of the child? The possible angles here include emotional impact on the ex, the unborn child, and societal expectations. Legally, if the author isn't the biological father, he might not have obligations. But emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and stress. However, the ex's actions, like cheating and not working, contributed to the breakup. The author might feel wronged, but the child is innocent. There's a conflict between his emotional state and the child's well-being.\n\nI should consider the context of the relationship. The author had already broken up with her, so maybe he's under no obligation to take her back. However, the ex is pregnant and in a less-than-ideal situation with her parents. The author's home could offer a better environment. But the key point is the paternity test result. If the child isn't his, he's under no legal responsibility. Yet, some might argue that he's still morally responsible for the ex's well-being, especially since he allowed her to stay before the test.\n\nBut if the author feels he was manipulated into staying with her under false pretenses (cheating and not taking the test), that adds another layer. The mutual friends criticizing him might be right in the sense that the child is innocent, but the author's emotional state and past betrayal are valid. It's a tough balance between personal rights and responsibility towards others.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often looks at actions and intentions. The author did agree to a paternity test, which shows he wanted clarity. Once the results were known, his decision to end the arrangement isn't necessarily malicious. However, the ex is in a vulnerable state, and the author's home might be the best option for her and the child. But the author's mental health and the betrayal by the ex (cheating) are significant factors. So is he in the wrong? If he's not the father, maybe not. But if he's being cruel by not offering support despite not being the father, that's a different angle.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author has a moral obligation beyond legal. If he's not the father, he's not obligated, but the community might still judge him for not helping. However, considering the betrayal and the ex's initial behavior, the author's decision might be seen as self-preservation. But the child's best interest is also important. The child isn't at fault, so even if the author isn't the father, the ex's situation is dire. Maybe the author is in the right because he's not the father and the ex's actions in the relationship were problematic. But others might argue he should still help. The answer is probably B (No, not in the wrong) because he's not the father and the ex's actions contributed to the situation.\n"
