It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, but it got rocky. He broke up with her when she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially, and he suspected cheating. She left to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave.\n\nThe author is now being criticized by friends and his ex for not supporting her and the child. The main question is whether he's wrong for not taking responsibility for the child since it's not his.\n\nSo, legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to provide support. But ethically, it's more complex. Some might argue that once he was involved in the pregnancy and let her stay, he has a moral responsibility. Others might say he's entitled to distance himself, especially given the cheating and financial issues.\n\nThe author mentions emotional turmoil, betrayal, and feeling used. He might feel that staying with her was a mistake. However, by allowing her to stay and then leaving after the paternity test, some could see it as abandoning her in a vulnerable state, regardless of the test result.\n\nOn the other hand, if he didn't cheat and she did, that's a significant betrayal. He might not feel responsible for a child that's not his, especially after being mistreated. But the problem is that even if he didn't father the child, she's still carrying it and needs support. If he's financially capable, some might argue he should help regardless.\n\nThe key points are the paternity test confirming it's not his, his prior support during the stay, and the circumstances of their breakup. The author's actions post-test could be seen as selfish if he's able to help but refuses. However, if he feels manipulated or hurt, others might empathize with his decision to cut ties.\n\nIt's a tough call. Legally, he's not wrong. Ethically, it depends on perspectives. Since the question is about being in the wrong, not legal, it's more about societal judgment. If the community sees him as abandoning someone in need, then A. If they see it as a right to walk away after betrayal, then B. The answer might be A, but there's nuance.\n"
