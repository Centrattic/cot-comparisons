  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The person found out the child isn't theirs after agreeing to let their pregnant ex stay with them. They had a paternity test, and when it came back negative, they asked her to leave. Now friends are saying they're being unfair to the unborn child.\n\nFirst, legally, if the paternity test proves the child isn't theirs, the person isn't legally obligated to support the child. But morally, it's more nuanced. The ex cheated, which adds to the betrayal. The person was already stressed because the ex wasn't contributing financially and was suspected of cheating. They took her back to protect the child from smoking, but after the test, they no longer feel responsible.\n\nThe question is about whether they were wrong. The person might feel they were justified in leaving her after discovering the infidelity and the child not being theirs. However, the unborn child is innocent. Some might argue they should help regardless of the circumstances. But others might say they shouldn't be forced to support a child they aren't the father of, especially after being betrayed.\n\nAlso, the person is struggling emotionally. They might not be in a good place to take on the responsibility of a child. The ex was cheating, so trust is broken. The person might not want to be involved if they're not the father. But the child's well-being is a factor. However, it's the mother's responsibility to care for the child, not necessarily the ex's, unless there's a legal or agreed-upon arrangement.\n\nIn terms of answer options, the user is asking if they are in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering all factors, it's a tough call. But if the person isn't the biological father and there's no legal obligation, they might not be in the wrong. The cheating adds to the emotional burden, and they might be justified in not wanting to support the child. However, some might argue that because they were in a relationship, they might have assumed responsibility, but the paternity test clears that. So, probably B (No).\n"
