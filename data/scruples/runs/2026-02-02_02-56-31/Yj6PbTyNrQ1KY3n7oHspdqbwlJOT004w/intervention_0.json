  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the guy is asking if he's in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they were together for two years, but the last few months were rocky. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he had to support them financially. He suspected she was cheating, which led to him breaking up with her and her going to live with her parents. Then she came back, told him she was pregnant, and he let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. She agreed happily. The test came back negative, and he told her to leave. Now she's with friends, and people are saying he's being cruel.\n\nHmm, so he had a good reason to be suspicious\u2014cheating and financial strain. He agreed to let her stay back because of her parents' smoking, which is unhealthy for the baby. But once the paternity test proved he wasn't the father, he felt relieved and kicked her out. Now he's feeling conflicted, especially since people are telling him he should help.\n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support it. But morally, it's more complicated. He might feel betrayed because she didn't tell him about the affair before the pregnancy. The fact that she was cheaters a significant issue. Also, he's been through a lot emotionally, and maybe he's just done with the stress. However, the baby is innocent. But he's not the father, so it's not his responsibility. The problem is whether he has a moral duty to help even though he's not the father. Some might say yes, others no. It's a tough call. He might be in the right because he's not the father and he had a right to know. But there's a part of him that might feel responsible because he was involved. But legally and ethically, if he's not the father, he's not obligated. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
