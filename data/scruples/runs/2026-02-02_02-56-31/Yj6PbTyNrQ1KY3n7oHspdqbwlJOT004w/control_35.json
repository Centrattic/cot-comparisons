It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author's ex-girlfriend is pregnant, and he initially agreed to let her stay with him because he didn't want the child exposed to her mom's smoking. But when the paternity test showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he should help anyway.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. Emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. He was already supporting her financially before the breakup, and the relationship had issues\u2014cheating, job loss, etc. He might feel betrayed and doesn't want to be responsible for someone else's child.\n\nOn the other side, some might argue that even if it's not his child, he might still have a moral obligation because he allowed her to stay in his home, expecting to be a father figure. Also, the child's well-being is a consideration. But others might say he's not responsible for her choices and shouldn't have to care for someone else's child, especially after the betrayal.\n\nThe ex is staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking, so the author's initial reason for letting her stay is still valid. But he's now distancing himself. The mutual friends think he's being unfair, but the author is dealing with emotional turmoil and feels betrayed.\n\nI think the key points are consent and responsibility. He agreed to support her under the pretense of being the father. Once that's false, he might not feel responsible anymore. However, by allowing her to stay, maybe he took on some responsibility regardless of paternity. But legally, he's not bound, and emotionally, it's a tough spot. So, depending on perspective, but the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong (B). But maybe there's a middle ground where he's not entirely wrong, but in the context of the question, which asks if he's in the wrong, B could be the answer if the focus is on his legal right and the circumstances of betrayal.\n"
