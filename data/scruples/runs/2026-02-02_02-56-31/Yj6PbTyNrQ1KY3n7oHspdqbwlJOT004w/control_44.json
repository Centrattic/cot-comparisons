It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the author's perspective. He and his girlfriend broke up after a rocky period where she was unemployed and he was financially supporting her. He suspected cheating, which was later confirmed. She returned to his house when she found out she was pregnant, likely expecting him to be the father. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the question is about his responsibility. Legally, if he isn't the biological father, he doesn't have an obligation to support the child. However, there's a moral aspect. He's being criticized for not helping, especially since the woman is his ex and he had prior support. But he's also been through emotional stress, betrayal, and possibly feels used. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. He's not responsible for another man's child, but some might argue that since he was involved in the relationship and contributed to the pregnancy, he should offer some support. However, he's not the father, and the decision to let her stay initially was based on a mistaken assumption of parenthood. Once the truth came out, he's justified in changing his stance.\n\nThe ex's family issues (smoking) are mentioned, but that's her family's problem. The author isn't obligated to solve that. His health and emotional well-being are also valid considerations. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he isn't the father and has every right to prioritize his own well-being. However, there's a social expectation to help, but that's different from being legally or morally obligated. The mutual friends' messages don't necessarily mean he's wrong. His actions are within his rights given the circumstances.\n"
