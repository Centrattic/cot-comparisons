It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person was in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the user and their ex were together for two years. The relationship got rocky towards the end because the ex lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on the user financially. The user also suspected cheating, which led to a breakup, and the ex moved in with her parents.\n\nThen, the ex came back saying she was pregnant, and the user let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and they did the test. The result was that the child isn't the user's. Upon finding out, the user told her to leave. Now, the ex and others are criticizing the user for being a terrible person and not helping the child.\n\nThe user is conflicted: they feel emotionally raw, betrayed, and are being pressured to take care of the child despite the circumstances. The question is whether they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, in many places, the legal responsibility of a father isn't established unless there's a legal paternity test or the man has acknowledged paternity. Since the test shows the child isn't theirs, the user might not have a legal obligation. However, morally, it's more complex. The user provided a home after being lied to, and now feels used. Others are saying they should help, but the user is struggling with their emotions.\n\nBut the user's main argument is that they were deceived. The ex might have known the child wasn't his and still tried to get him to stay, which could be seen as manipulation. The user's decision to ask her to leave after discovering the truth could be justified as protecting themselves from further emotional harm. However, the child is innocent, and some might argue that the user has a moral responsibility to help regardless of the deception.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the user's own well-being. They've been through a lot, and forcing them to care for a child they weren't the father of could add more stress. But others might see it as selfish to walk away from an innocent child in need.\n\nLegally, if the user hasn't legally acknowledged paternity, they might not be responsible. Morally, it's a gray area. The user was wronged, but the child is not to blame. However, the user has the right to make decisions about their own home and life, especially after being deceived. They might not be in the wrong for wanting to move on and not take care of a child that isn't theirs. On the other hand, some might say that once they knew about the pregnancy, they had a responsibility to support the mother and child, regardless of the paternity result.\n\nIn summary, the user's decision could be seen as a way to protect themselves after being betrayed, and legally they might not be obligated. But morally, it's a tough call. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might depend on societal expectations. If the user is being criticized for not helping, some might say they're being selfish. However, the deception could justify their need to distance themselves. So, I think the answer is B (No, not in the wrong), based on the circumstances and the legal aspect, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
