It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. They had a two-year relationship, but it got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading him to break up with her. She came back when she found out she was pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. The test showed he's not the father, so he asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he's not obligated to support the child. But there might be other factors, like if he was the presumed father and had already started supporting her. However, since they had an agreement to test and he did his part, maybe he's in the clear legally.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. He's dealing with betrayal, as he suspected cheating and it was confirmed. The girlfriend might have known the child wasn't his and still asked him to support it, which could be seen as manipulative. However, she was pregnant, and the author allowed her to stay temporarily. Now that the test is back, he's choosing not to be involved. On the other hand, the child is innocent, and the question is whether the author has a moral responsibility to help despite not being the biological father.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's parents smoke, so he initially took her in for the child's health. Now that he's not the father, he might feel less obligation, but others are saying he should still help. However, he's been through emotional turmoil and might not be in a good place to support someone else's child. \n\nThere's a balance between his emotional well-being and the child's welfare. The author might feel wronged due to the cheating and the deception about the child's paternity. If the girlfriend knew he wasn't the father and still led him to believe he was, that's a significant betrayal. However, if she genuinely didn't know, maybe she was as surprised as he was. But the story doesn't clarify that. The text suggests that she was \"practically beaming\" when she told him, which could imply she was excited about him being the father, possibly knowing or not. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author wasn't the father, he might not have a legal duty, but there's a moral question about whether he should still help. However, he's not the parent, so maybe it's not his responsibility. The mutual friends saying he's a terrible person might be projecting their own values, but it's his life and his emotional capacity. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. He had a valid reason to want the paternity test, and once it was proven he wasn't the father, he felt justified in ending the living arrangement. The cheating adds to the betrayal, so his decision might be seen as self-preservation. However, some might argue that he should still help the child regardless of the circumstances. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given the information, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
