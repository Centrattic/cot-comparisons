It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did the wrong thing by kicking their pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, there's the issue of the pregnancy. They were in a relationship, she got pregnant, they agreed to a paternity test, and when it turned out the kid isn't theirs, he kicked her out. The key points here are consent, responsibility, and emotional state.\n\nHe mentions the relationship was rocky, she was living off him financially, and he suspected cheating. Then when she came back with the pregnancy, he agreed to let her stay but with the caveat of a paternity test. She agreed. So, he had a reason to want the test to confirm paternity. When the results showed he's not the father, he felt justified in ending the living arrangement.\n\nBut here's the catch: he's the one who agreed to her staying under the condition of the test. Once the test confirmed he's not the father, he's not legally obligated to support the child. However, there's a moral or ethical angle here. Even if the child isn't his, she was pregnant under the assumption that he was the father. If he's been supporting her financially during her stay, maybe he feels responsible. But once paternity is confirmed, maybe he's not legally bound to help.\n\nOn the other hand, she's pregnant, and the home is supposed to be a safe place for her and the child. He's being accused of being unkind by others, and he's feeling conflicted. His reasoning is that he's been through emotional turmoil, and he's not willing to take care of someone else's child. \n\nLegally, he's not the father, so he's not obligated to provide support. But ethically, if he's already involved in the pregnancy and the living arrangement, some might argue he has a moral responsibility to help. However, the fact that she cheated is a big factor. Cheating can be a valid reason for breaking off any further involvement, especially if trust was broken.\n\nHe's also dealing with his own emotional state, which is valid. The mutual friends are pressuring him, but he's considering his own well-being. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, probably not. Ethically, it's more gray. But given that he's not the father and he had the right to decide who lives in his house, maybe he's justified. However, if he had been supporting her financially during her stay, there might be ethical obligations. But since he's now cutting her off after the test, it's his choice as long as he's not violating any laws.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on legal vs. moral responsibilities. Since the child isn't his, he's not legally responsible. He has the right to ask her to leave. The cheating adds another layer of betrayal. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
