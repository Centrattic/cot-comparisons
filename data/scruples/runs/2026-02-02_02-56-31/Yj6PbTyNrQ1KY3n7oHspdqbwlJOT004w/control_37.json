It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, but it got rocky. The girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading the author to break up with her. She then came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child wasn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are saying he's wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the relationship history, the paternity issue, and the decision to ask her to leave after the test. The author is feeling conflicted because he's being called a bad person, but he's also been through emotional turmoil, including suspected cheating confirmed later.\n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. But morally or socially, maybe there's a different expectation. The author might feel he's not responsible for another man's child, especially after the betrayal. However, some might argue that once he got involved in the pregnancy, he's now part of the situation, even if he's not the biological father. \n\nAlso, the ex was staying with her parents, but they have health issues (smoking), so he let her stay to protect the baby. Now she's staying with a friend. But the author might not feel responsible anymore since the paternity is proven. \n\nThe author is being criticized for not taking responsibility, but he's not the biological father. However, some might say he encouraged the pregnancy by letting her stay, expecting to be a father figure. But legally, unless he legally adopted the child, he's not obligated. \n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, breakup, financial strain, emotional rollercoaster. It's possible he's justified in wanting to distance himself. But others might see it as abandoning a vulnerable person. \n\nI think the answer depends on societal expectations versus personal responsibility. The author isn't legally responsible, but socially, there's pressure. However, he's not the father, so maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because he's not obligated to care for a child that isn't his. But there's a nuance here. If he agreed to help out after the test, maybe there's an expectation, but since the test showed he's not the father, he's not. So, he's not in the wrong.\n"
