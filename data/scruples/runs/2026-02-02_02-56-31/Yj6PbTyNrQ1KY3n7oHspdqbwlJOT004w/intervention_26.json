It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they did the wrong thing by kicking their pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship that ended because the girlfriend wasn't contributing financially and he suspected cheating. She moved in with her parents after the breakup. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed he's not the father, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are telling him he's in the wrong for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did he have a right to ask her to leave after discovering he's not the father? Legally, if he's not the biological father, he's not obligated to support the child. Emotionally and ethically, it's trickier. He was in a relationship, thought the kid was his, and then found out it wasn't. The ex was cheating, which he felt was a betrayal. \n\nHe's dealing with emotional turmoil\u2014maybe feeling used or betrayed. The friends are pressuring him to take care of the child, but he's not the father. However, there's a possibility he might feel responsible because he was in a relationship with the mother. But legally and morally, if you're not the father, you don't have the same obligations. \n\nBut then, what about the unborn child's well-being? If the mother's living conditions are bad (smoking), maybe there's a concern for the child's health. However, the user is not the legal guardian, so he's not responsible for ensuring her living conditions unless he's taking custody. Since the test proved he's not the father, he's under no obligation to provide a home for her. \n\nHis decision to ask her to leave after the paternity test is negative seems justified from a legal standpoint. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, and the shock of not being the father. The friends might be misunderstanding the situation, thinking he's abandoning a child, but the child isn't his. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that since he was in a relationship, he should take responsibility, but legally and biologically, that's not required. Also, the mother's actions (cheating, not working) contributed to the breakup. He's not obligated to support someone else's child, especially after being deceived.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because legally and based on the information, he's not the father and thus not responsible for the child. However, the emotional aspect is complex, but the user's actions are understandable given the circumstances.\n"
