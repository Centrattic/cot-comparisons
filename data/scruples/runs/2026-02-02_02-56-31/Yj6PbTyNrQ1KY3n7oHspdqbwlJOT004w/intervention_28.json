It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were wrong to kick their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship, it got rocky when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading to financial strain. He suspected cheating and broke up. She came back saying she's pregnant, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are saying he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. Legally, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. He had already broken up with her before the pregnancy was revealed. The cheating adds to the betrayal. He felt used, which makes sense. But the question is about fairness and moral responsibility.\n\nHe provided shelter not because of the child but because her mother smoked. But once he found out the child wasn't his, he felt no responsibility. The friends are pressuring him to help, but he's struggling with his emotions.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's not obligated to support a child that isn't his. Ethically, it's debatable. Some might argue that once he found out, he should step up for the child's sake. Others would say he's not responsible for a child he didn't sire, especially after being cheated on. The fact that she had already cheated on him before the pregnancy adds to the emotional turmoil.\n\nBut the user is questioning if he was unfair to the unborn child. The child is innocent, but the legal parent is the biological mother. The user isn't the father, so he's not legally responsible. However, if he's in a situation where he can help without being obligated, maybe he could consider it. But the question is whether he was wrong. If he's not the father and the relationship was already over due to cheating, then he's not necessarily in the wrong for walking away. The emotional burden is real, but his decision seems based on the facts he knows. So, answer B: Not in the wrong.\n"
