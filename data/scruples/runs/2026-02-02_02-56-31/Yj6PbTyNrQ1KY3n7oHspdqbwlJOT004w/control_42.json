It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the guy had a girlfriend for two years. They broke up because she wasn't working, he was supporting her, and he suspected she cheated. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the kid wasn't his, so he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the paternity test proved he isn't the father, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. But maybe there's emotional or moral responsibility here. The guy is feeling emotionally raw after cheating and betrayal. He might be justified in not wanting to support someone else's child, especially since he's going through a tough time. \n\nBut on the other hand, the woman is pregnant, and she's in a bad situation with her parents (smoking, etc.). The guy offered her a place to stay before the test, so maybe he's seen as abandoning her now. However, the key point is the child isn't his. Legally, he doesn't have to help, but morally, is there an obligation? Some people might argue he should help because he allowed her to stay and then changed his mind, leaving her in a precarious position. Others might say he's not responsible for someone else's child and that his emotional state is valid. \n\nThe mutual friends are criticizing him, but maybe they're not considering his side. The woman did cheat, which is a betrayal. The guy might feel justified in cutting ties after that. Also, he was already in a financially strained situation, supporting her when she wasn't working. Now that she's pregnant with someone else's child, it's a burden he might not want to take on. \n\nBut there's also the argument that once a child is involved, the community or a previous partner might have some responsibility to help, regardless of the relationship status. However, since he's not the father, his responsibility is limited. He's not a bad person for not wanting to take care of a child that isn't his, especially after being cheated on and through a lot of emotional turmoil. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong because he's not the biological father and has the right to prioritize his own emotional and financial well-being.\n"
