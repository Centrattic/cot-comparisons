  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. Hmm.\n\nFirst, they were in a two-year relationship. The ex lost her job, stopped looking for work, and the user had to support them financially. Then he suspected cheating, broke up, and she moved in with her parents. But then she came back, told him she was pregnant, and he let her stay again, agreeing to a paternity test. Once the test showed it wasn't his, he kicked her out. Now she and others are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nThe user is emotional, feeling raw, and considering if he was unfair. So, what's the legal and ethical angle here?\n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support it. But ethically, it's more complex. He provided a home thinking the child was his, then discovered it wasn't. He might feel betrayed, especially if she cheated. However, the child isn't at fault. The user's argument is that he's under stress from the cheating and the financial burden. But the ex's parents smoke, so he let her stay to protect the child from that. Now he's cutting her off, which affects the unborn child.\n\nThe user is being accused of being heartless. But from his perspective, he's dealing with emotional trauma. The key points are: no legal duty to support a child that's not his, but there's a moral question about helping someone in need. If he's not the father, maybe he's not responsible. But if he helped her before, is he morally obligated to continue? It depends on the circumstances. He might have a right to prioritize his own well-being after being deceived.\n\nIs he in the wrong? If he's not the father, then legally, no. But ethically, if he's aware of her living conditions and the child's safety, maybe he should consider helping. However, he's entitled to set boundaries, especially after a cheating scandal. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but with the nuance that he might have other moral considerations.\n"
