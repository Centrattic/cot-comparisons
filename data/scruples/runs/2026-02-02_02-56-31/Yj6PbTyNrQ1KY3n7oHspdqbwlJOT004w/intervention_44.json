  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, but the relationship got rocky. He broke up with her when she stopped looking for work and he suspected cheating. She came back when she got pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay temporarily with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, paternity is usually determined by the father's acknowledgment or a court order. Since the test showed he's not the father, he might not have legal obligations towards the child. However, the girlfriend might still be seeking support, especially if she's in a vulnerable state. \n\nEmotionally, the user is struggling because others are criticizing him for not helping. But he's dealing with betrayal, financial stress, and the emotional toll of possibly being a father. His decision to leave her after the test is based on his own feelings and the confirmed cheating.\n\nThe question is about moral wrongdoing. Some might argue that he's not obligated to support a child that isn't his, especially after being cheated on. Others might say that since he was involved in the relationship and the pregnancy, he has a responsibility to help. But legally and morally, the responsibility for a child typically falls on the biological parents. Since he's not the father, his obligation might be less, but societal expectations can vary.\n\nConsidering the cheating, which he had already broken up with her over, it adds to the betrayal. His decision to end the relationship and not take care of a child that isn't his might be seen as justified by some. However, the criticism from others might stem from the idea that he should still help because he was part of the relationship.\n\nIn terms of fairness to the unborn child, if the mother is struggling and the child isn't his, he's not responsible for their care. But if she's in a harmful environment (like her parents' smoking), he might be seen as selfish for not offering help despite not being the father. However, he's also in a vulnerable emotional state and might need time to heal.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on balancing his rights and responsibilities against hers. Since he's not the father and the relationship ended due to cheating, he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
