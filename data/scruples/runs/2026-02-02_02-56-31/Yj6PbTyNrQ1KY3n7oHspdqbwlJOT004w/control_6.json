It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for kicking out their pregnant ex when they found out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author and their ex were together for two years. The relationship got rocky because the ex lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading the author to have to support both. The author suspected cheating, broke up, and the ex left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. They lived together again, did the test, found out the child isn't his, and he kicked her out. Now friends are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nSo the key points here: the author initially agreed to let her stay for the sake of the child's health (due to her mom smoking). They had a paternity test, which came back negative. Then he kicks her out. Friends are pressuring him to take her back, but he's conflicted.\n\nI need to decide if he's in the wrong. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. He's been through a breakup, possible cheating, financial strain, and now this situation. But the ex might have known the child wasn't his and used that to manipulate him back into the relationship. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to protect his emotional well-being and financial stability. He's not responsible for a child that isn't his. On the other hand, maybe he should consider the child's best interest, but he's not the biological father. Also, the ex might be in a tough spot financially and emotionally, but that's her responsibility now. \n\nThe author's decision is based on the paternity test result. He was upfront about the condition of the paternity test before agreeing to let her stay. So he followed through on his terms. Friends might argue he should help, but he's not obligated. The ex's cheating is another layer of betrayal, which adds to his emotional burden. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a decision based on the information he had and the terms they agreed upon. The legal and ethical responsibilities don't extend to a child that isn't his, especially after the test confirmed it. His well-being and right to not be coerced into a situation he's not comfortable with should be considered. Therefore, answer B (No).\n"
