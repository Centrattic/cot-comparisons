  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he found out the child isn't his and kicked his pregnant girlfriend out. They had a complicated relationship, with her being unemployed and him suspecting her of cheating. Then she got pregnant, he agreed to let her stay but wanted a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he asked her to leave. Now he's getting messages from friends and others saying he's being a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Legally, if he's not the biological father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. But there might be moral or ethical considerations. The user is asking if he's in the wrong morally, not legally. \n\nThen, the emotional and ethical side. He's been through a lot: the breakup, her moving back in, the paternity test, and the betrayal from her cheating. He's emotionally raw. The user is conflicted because he feels the child might need a better environment than her parents, but he's also hurt and doesn't want to be responsible. \n\nOther people are telling him to take her back and help, but he's unsure. The question is whether his actions are unfair. He's not the father, so maybe he's not obligated. However, by letting her stay initially and then leaving when the test came back, is he being reasonable? Also, the fact that she cheated on him adds another layer of betrayal. \n\nBut the child is innocent. Even if the mother cheated, is the user responsible for the child? Maybe there's a debate here. On one hand, he's not the father, so it's not his responsibility. On the other, if the child is in a harmful environment (smoking, etc.), he might feel a moral duty to help despite not being the father. \n\nHowever, he's also under a lot of stress and emotional trauma. Forcing him to take responsibility when he's not the father might be unfair. But then again, maybe he should step up for the child's well-being regardless of his feelings. \n\nI need to balance these factors. The key points are: non-biological father, mother's family environment is bad, his emotional state, and the mother's infidelity. The user's actions were based on the paternity test result, which showed he's not the father. So legally, he's not the father, but morally, is he responsible? \n\nThere's a difference between legal and moral responsibility. Since he's not the father, he might not have legal obligations, but morally, people might argue he should help because of his initial support and the child's well-being. However, others might say he's not obligated to help given the circumstances and the mother's actions (cheating, financial issues). \n\nThe user's friends are pressuring him, but maybe he's within his rights to say no. The answer depends on societal expectations. In some cultures, men might feel responsible even if not the father, but in others, it's the mother's responsibility. \n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't legally wrong, but morally, it's a gray area. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the non-parental responsibility, I think the answer leans towards B (No), because he's not the father and he's acting based on that information. However, there's a moral argument for helping, but the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his own emotional well-being after the betrayal.\n"
