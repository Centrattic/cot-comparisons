  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he found out the child isn't his after agreeing to let his pregnant ex live with him again. He kicked her out, and people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it. But ethically, it's more complicated. He was considering being a father, which is a big responsibility. Now that the paternity is proven, he's not the father. Did he have a responsibility to support her even if it's not his child? Maybe if he had accepted the child as his own and then found out, but in this case, he had a paternity test done, which shows he was cautious. \n\nHe mentions that the ex was cheating, which adds to the betrayal. He was already in a rocky situation, financially strained, and emotionally hurt. The friends are pressuring him to take care of the child, but he's feeling overwhelmed. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex left him for her parents, and now the pregnant woman is in a smoking environment. But after the paternity test, he's relieved it's not his, so he's not bound by that. However, the child still needs care. Is there an obligation beyond biological ties? Maybe not legally, but socially, some might say yes. \n\nHe let her stay under the condition of the paternity test. Once the test cleared him, he's not responsible. But maybe he could have helped financially without taking her in. However, he's in a vulnerable emotional state. \n\nThe key points are his knowledge of the child not being his, his prior suspicions of cheating, and his own well-being. The answer depends on whether one believes he has a duty to support a child he's not the father of, especially after discovering the betrayal. Since he's not the father, legally and in terms of personal responsibility, he's not obligated. But emotionally, he might feel conflicted. However, given the circumstances, he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being and not being the child's father.\n"
