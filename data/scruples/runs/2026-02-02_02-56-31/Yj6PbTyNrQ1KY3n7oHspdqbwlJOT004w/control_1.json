It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, then the ex lost her job, stopped looking for work, and the author suspects cheating. They broke up, she left. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant, and he lets her stay but insists on a paternity test. The test comes back negative, and he kicks her out. Now, friends are telling him he's a bad person.\n\nThe key points here are consent, responsibility, and emotional state. When the author agreed to let her stay, he did so under the condition of a paternity test. Since she passed that test, and the result was negative, he felt betrayed. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support them. However, morally, the situation is more complex. The ex might have known the child wasn't his from the start but still asked him to take her in, which could be considered deceitful. On the other hand, the author might be using the paternity test as an excuse to avoid the situation, especially after the breakup.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal and the stress of being financially responsible for someone else. His decision to leave her out might stem from self-preservation. However, the unborn child is innocent, and abandoning them could be seen as harsh, even if it's not his child. \n\nThe friends' criticism might be valid if he's cutting off support without a clear reason. But the author had valid reasons to distrust her, especially after the breakup over cheating. The paternity test was a fair condition, and her deception (if she knew the child wasn't his) complicates the morality here.\n\nIn the end, it's a mix of legal rights and moral obligations. Legally, he's not in the wrong. But morally, if the ex intentionally lied, she's at fault. The author's actions are a response to her deceit, so he's not the only one at fault. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he had conditions and she didn't meet them, he's justified in his actions. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
