  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking their pregnant ex-girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. First, I need to break down the situation step by step.\n\nThe user and his ex were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and didn't look for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating and broke up with her, leading her to live with her parents. Then she comes back, pregnant, and he lets her stay on the condition of a paternity test. The test reveals the baby isn't his, and he kicks her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the baby, but he's torn emotionally.\n\nSo, the main points here are: legal obligations, emotional state, and moral responsibility. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support the child. But morally, there's a debate. He wasn't the father, so he might feel no duty. However, if he was led to believe he was the father and then found out, there's a sense of betrayal. \n\nThe ex cheated, which adds complexity. The user might feel lied to. But the baby is innocent, so some might argue he should help regardless. However, considering the user's emotional state and the circumstances\u2014like the ex not working and relying on him financially\u2014it's a heavy burden. \n\nHe allowed her to stay under the condition of a paternity test, which she agreed to. Once the test came back negative, his decision to ask her to leave is based on the test results. The user might feel justified in ending the arrangement once the child isn't his. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the baby's well-being. Even though it's not his, he might still have a moral obligation to help, especially if the ex's parents are smoking. However, he chose to let her go to a friend instead. \n\nThe mutual friends are pressuring him to take her back, but he's struggling with whether he's being fair. The key here is whether he was wrong legally and morally. Legally, no. Morally, it's subjective. Some might say he's justified, others not. The answer needs to balance these aspects. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because legally he's not obligated, and he made a decision based on the paternity test. However, it's a nuanced situation where personal feelings and circumstances play a big role. The user's emotional state and the cheating factor also contribute to his decision.\n"
