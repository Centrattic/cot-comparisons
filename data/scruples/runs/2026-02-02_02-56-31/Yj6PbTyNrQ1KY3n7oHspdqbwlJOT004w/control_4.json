It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he kicked out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, they were in a relationship for two years, but the last few months were rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating, which he later confirmed. He broke up with her, and she left to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant and he let her back in with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the kid isn't his, he kicked her out.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The ex and others are saying he's being cruel to the unborn child. But he's feeling emotionally raw, betrayed, and probably doesn't want to support a child that isn't his. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects here.\n\nLegally, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. So from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong. Ethically, it's more complicated. The ex is pregnant, and the child is dependent on others for care. Even if he's not the father, the child still needs support. But he's not responsible for that, right? The mother is the one responsible for the child's care. However, in some cultures or communities, there's an expectation of support, but that's not a legal requirement.\n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. The betrayal from cheating and the financial strain from supporting her without work. He might feel that he can't handle the added stress of caring for a child that isn't his. But the ex is the mother, so she's the primary caregiver. The question is about his responsibility. Since the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to help. However, some might argue that he should help because he allowed her to stay in his home and then changed his mind, which could leave her in a difficult position. \n\nBut from a strict standpoint, if he's not the father, he's not responsible. The mother is. So ethically, he's not in the wrong. The others are pressuring him, but that doesn't mean he's wrong. Also, the mother's parents smoke, so she's staying with a friend. He let her stay initially to avoid the smoke but left it to her to take responsibility after the test. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But maybe there's more to consider. Did he have any obligation beyond the legal? If he allowed her to stay in his home with the understanding that he might be the father, but then after the test, he's removing her, perhaps he should have considered other options. But he's not legally responsible, and the mother is the one who needs to care for the child. So he's not in the wrong.\n"
