  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?\nMy ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were wrong for kicking out their pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, had a rocky end when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work. He suspected cheating, broke up, she left. Then she came back pregnant, he agreed to let her stay to avoid her smoking parents. They arranged a paternity test, which came back negative. He asked her to leave, and now others are telling him he's wrong.\n\nThe main question is about whether he was in the wrong. Legally, paternity can be contested. If the test proves he's not the father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally and ethically, it's trickier. The user had already broken up with her due to cheating and financial issues. The cheating part adds to the betrayal. If the child isn't his, he's not responsible, so he might feel justified in leaving. \n\nBut others argue that the child is innocent. However, the user isn't the biological father, so his responsibility isn't the same. The user might be struggling with guilt, but he's not obligated to help. However, maybe he should consider other options for the ex and the child, but that's a different point. The key is whether he was wrong.\n\nThe answer hinges on legal and personal responsibility. Since the child isn't his, and he had a valid reason to leave based on cheating and financial strain, he might not be wrong. But socially, people might judge him for not supporting. The answer is probably B (No), but maybe with nuances. Need to check if the user's actions are legally and ethically defensible.\n"
