It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is a man who had a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. The relationship became rocky towards the end when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on his financial support. He suspected she was cheating and eventually broke up with her, leading her to move in with her parents. Then, she came back to tell him she's pregnant, thinking it's his child. He agreed to let her stay again, making a paternity test a condition. The paternity test later showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, she and others are calling him a bad person for not supporting her and the child.\n\nThe user is torn between feeling that he's done the right thing and the pressure from friends and his own emotional turmoil. The core question is whether he's in the wrong for kicking her out after discovering the child isn't his.\n\nLet me consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, in many jurisdictions, a man is not automatically the legal father unless he signs a paternity agreement or if the court determines it. Since the test showed he's not the father, he legally isn't responsible for the child. So from a legal standpoint, he isn't obligated to support the child. \n\nEthically, this is trickier. Even if he isn't the biological father, some might argue that he has a moral obligation if he was led to believe he was the father and had started to accept that role. However, once the paternity test negates that, his responsibility might be seen as lifted. The woman's actions here are also in question\u2014she knew she was pregnant and came to him to claim it was his, even after a breakup. If she didn't want him to know about the paternity, maybe she shouldn't have come back to him. \n\nHe had agreed to the paternity test, which she agreed to. That shows he wanted clarity. Once the test results came in, his decision to ask her to leave seems based on the actual paternity. It's his home, and he's within his rights to ask her to leave. The pressure from mutual friends and her friends might not be valid. They might be assuming he should feel responsible, but unless there's a legal obligation, he isn't bound by that.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he should have offered support regardless, but this is more about moral obligation rather than legal. Since he's not the father, his emotional investment might not be justified. However, the emotional turmoil he's experiencing is real. The woman had cheated and left him in a vulnerable state. The situation is complex, but legally and ethically, if he's not the father, he's not wrong for not wanting to take responsibility. \n\nAnother angle: Did he act out of anger or betrayal? He mentions suspecting her of cheating, which was confirmed. So his trust was broken. The emotional rawness might have influenced his decision, but he followed through with a paternity test to confirm. So his action was based on facts, not just suspicion. \n\nIs he being unfair to the unborn child? The child isn't at fault here, but the responsibility of the father isn't his. The unborn child's well-being is important, but that's the mother's responsibility now. Unless he wants to take on a supportive role voluntarily, he isn't obligated.\n\nIn summary, the key points are legal paternity, the paternity test result, the woman's role in the situation, and his right to his own home. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Ethically, it's more nuanced, but he's not necessarily wrong for making a decision based on the test results.\n"
