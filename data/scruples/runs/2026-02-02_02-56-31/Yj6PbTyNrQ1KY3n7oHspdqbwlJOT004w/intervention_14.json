It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. So the scenario is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the man and his ex were together for two years. The relationship got rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he had to support them both. He suspected she was cheating, so he broke up with her and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back, pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave again. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not taking care of the child, even though it's not his.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he was wrong to kick her out. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support it. Paternity tests can establish legal parenthood. However, there's the moral side. Even if he's not the father, some might argue he has a responsibility given the circumstances. But others might say he's not responsible because he wasn't the biological father and the relationship had already ended.\n\nHe suspected cheating before, and the paternity test confirmed it. That betrayal might have influenced his decision to leave her. Now, he's feeling torn between his emotions and external pressure from friends. He's also dealing with financial strain from supporting her previously. \n\nThe ex is staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. The man is being pressured to take her back, but he's emotionally hurt. The key factors here are the legal responsibility versus moral obligation, the history of the relationship, and the immediate cause (cheating, financial issues) versus the current situation.\n\nLegally, he's not the father, so he isn't obligated. Ethically, some might say he's not responsible for another man's child. However, others might argue that once he got involved in the situation, even temporarily, he has a moral duty to help. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not doing that. \n\nFrom the story, he agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. Once the test proved negative, he didn't feel responsible anymore. That seems reasonable from his perspective. The emotional impact of the cheating and the financial burden could contribute to his decision. However, some might criticize him for not considering the pregnant woman's needs, but again, if the child isn't his, his responsibility isn't legally or morally binding unless he's a stepparent or has taken on that role. \n\nSo, considering all that, he's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
