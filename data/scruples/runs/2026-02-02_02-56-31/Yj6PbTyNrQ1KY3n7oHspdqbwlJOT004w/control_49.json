It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author was in a two-year relationship with his ex, who became pregnant. He let her stay with him because her mom smokes, and they agreed to a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he kicked her out. Now people are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the child. He's feeling conflicted about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The ex was living with him, and he had to support her financially. They broke up because she wasn't working and he suspected cheating. She came back pregnant, he allowed her to stay, and they did a paternity test. When it wasn't his, he kicked her out. Now she's staying with friends, and people are criticizing him.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support them. But morally, there's a debate. He was emotionally involved, and now he's dealing with betrayal and emotional strain. People are saying he should help regardless, but he's struggling with it.\n\nHe mentions that she cheated on him, which adds to his betrayal. However, the child is not his, so from a legal standpoint, he's not responsible. But he might feel a moral obligation. The key here is whether kicking her out was unfair to the unborn child. Since the child isn't his, he's not the biological father, so he's not legally bound. But maybe socially or morally, people expect him to help if he's the presumed father.\n\nBut he made the decision after the paternity test. He gave her a choice to stay under the condition of the test, which he followed through. If she knew there was a test and agreed, then he's acting on the results. The problem is that the ex might be expecting him to still help, but legally, he's not responsible. Emotionally, he's dealing with a lot, and his actions are based on the test results.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he followed through on the agreed-upon condition. He's not legally obligated to support a child that isn't his. While there's a moral argument that he could help, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he made the decision after the test and based on the results, he's not at fault. The answer would be B, No.\n"
