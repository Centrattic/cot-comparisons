I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word. \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author set up a session with a Domme (Dominatrix) for a specific price. They had a discussion about limits, including the safe word (dropping a ball). During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed-upon intensity, ignored the safe word, and caused the author significant pain, leading to injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and is being criticized by a friend who's also a Domme.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the agreed-upon terms (safe word, intensity level) were not followed by the Domme, resulting in harm. The author didn't pay the remaining fee, and the Domme is threatening to blackball him in the community.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The Domme's responsibility is to respect the boundaries set by the sub. The safe word is supposed to be an immediate stop. By ignoring it, she breached the agreement and potentially endangered the author's well-being. The author, in this case, isn't at fault for not paying because the service wasn't performed as agreed. The Domme's actions were negligent, and the author prioritized his health over paying for a service that was harmful.\n\nThe friend's criticism might stem from a misunderstanding or a different perspective on the situation, but the reality is that the Domme violated the agreed terms. The author's refusal to pay isn't a betrayal but a stand against unsafe practices. The physical injury adds weight to the author's decision to prioritize health and safety.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
