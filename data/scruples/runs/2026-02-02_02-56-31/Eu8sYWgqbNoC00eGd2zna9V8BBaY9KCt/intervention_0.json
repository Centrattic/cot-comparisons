I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is at fault here. So the situation is that they paid a domme $350 for a 90-minute session, gave a $50 deposit, and agreed on a medium power level for ballbusting. The safe word was dropping a ball, which they did when the pain became too much, but the domme kept going for three more kicks. Then the person breaks a restraint and ends up not paying the remaining $300, saying they're going to the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The domme ignored the safe word, which is a critical part of any consent-based dynamic, especially in BDSM. The safe word is supposed to be a clear signal to stop immediately. If she didn't respond to that, maybe she was in the wrong. Also, the session went beyond the agreed limits, which the person specified as medium power. The fact that she used full force after the agreed limit could be a breach of their consent.\n\nBut then, the friend who's a domme says the person is an asshole for not paying. The argument here is that the domme provided the service, even if it was painful. However, the service was supposed to be within agreed limits and with respect for the safe word. If those terms were broken, the person might have a valid reason not to pay. Also, the damage to the equipment (restraints) might be a point where the domme could claim compensation, but the person was in significant pain and possibly injured, which could justify their actions.\n\nIn legal terms, if the terms of the service (agreed limits and safe word) were not followed, the client might not be obligated to pay the full amount. The deposit given upfront might be forfeit if they didn't complete the payment, but the person might argue that the service was not as agreed, so the deposit should be returned. However, the domme could argue that the service was provided and the client is still responsible.\n\nEthically, the domme should prioritize the client's safety and well-being. Ignoring a safe word is a serious violation, which could lead to harm. The person's priority is their health, so going to the hospital is understandable. The domme's reaction of threatening to report the person for non-payment might be harsh, especially if the client's safety was compromised.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person might not be in the wrong. The domme violated the agreed-upon boundaries and ignored the safe word, leading to injury. The person's decision to stop the session and not pay the remaining amount could be justified because the service was not provided as negotiated. The friend's advice to pay might be biased or not considering the safety violation aspect. Therefore, the answer is B, the person is not in the wrong.\n"
