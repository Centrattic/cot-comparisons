I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (a dominant person in a BDSM context) and a submissive. The key points here are the use of a safe word and the aftermath.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with a Domme, paying a deposit. They agreed on a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal the Domme to stop. However, during the session, the Domme continued after the safe word was triggered. The author then didn't pay the remaining fee because of this, and the Domme is threatening to report them. The friend, who's also a Domme, says the author is wrong for not paying.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is obligated to pay despite the Domme ignoring the safe word. Safe words are crucial in BDSM for consent and safety. If the Domme breached the agreed-upon safety measures, then the author might have a valid reason not to pay. However, contracts and agreements in such services can vary. The author might argue that the service wasn't performed as agreed because safety protocols were ignored. But the Domme might claim the session was completed, hence payment is due.\n\nBut in many service agreements, if the service isn't rendered properly, the client isn't obligated to pay. Also, the Domme's actions could be considered negligent or even assault, depending on jurisdiction. The author going to the hospital supports the claim that there was harm caused, which could affect the payment obligation. The friend's opinion might be biased as she's in the same community and possibly has different expectations.\n\nIn legal terms, if the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms (safe word), the client might not have to pay. However, without a formal contract, it's a bit murkier. But given the health risk and the breach of trust, the author's decision not to pay seems justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
