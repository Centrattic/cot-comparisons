I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the user set up a session with clear limits\u2014medium max power. They established a safe word system with a ball in their hand. When the pain got too much, they dropped the ball three times, but the domme kept going. This led to injury and the user breaking restraints. The domme then demanded payment, and the user refused, citing her ignoring the safe word and causing harm. The user's friend, another domme, says they're in the wrong for not paying and for breaking the equipment.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Safe words are crucial in any consensual power exchange. If the domme ignored the safe word, which was clearly communicated, that's a major breach of trust and safety. The user's priority was their physical well-being, which is understandable. The domme's actions went beyond the agreed-upon limits, leading to injury. The user's decision not to pay could be justified as the service was not delivered as agreed and caused harm.\n\nOn the other hand, contracts and agreements are part of such services. The user agreed to pay for the session, and the domme might argue that the session was provided, albeit with unforeseen circumstances. However, the key point is the violation of the safe word, which is a non-negotiable in any consensual scenario. The user's health and safety should take precedence over financial obligations. The domme's responsibility to adhere to the terms set before the session is paramount. If she didn't follow those terms, the user isn't obligated to pay, especially when their well-being was compromised.\n\nThe friend's perspective might be from a business standpoint, but in this case, the domme failed in her role to respect the boundaries set by the sub. The user's refusal to pay is a stand against unsafe practices and holding the domme accountable for her actions. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong for not paying in this scenario.\n"
