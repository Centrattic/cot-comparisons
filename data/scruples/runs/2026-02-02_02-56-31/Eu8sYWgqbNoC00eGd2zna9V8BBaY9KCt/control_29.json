I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) and a sub. The key points here are the agreed-upon limits, the safe word, and the aftermath.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with a Domme for $350, paying a $50 deposit upfront. They discussed limits, specifically medium power ballbusting. The safe word was dropping a ball, which would signal the Domme to stop immediately. However, during the session, the Domme exceeded the agreed-upon intensity, leading to the author dropping the ball (the safe word), but she continued the punishment for three more kicks. This caused significant pain and injury, leading the author to not pay the remaining $300 and to leave without paying, citing that the Domme ignored the safe word and was negligent.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and practical aspects. The Domme agreed to the terms: medium power, and to stop if the safe word was triggered. By continuing after the safe word was clearly used, she violated the agreed-upon boundaries. The author's non-payment is a response to this breach of trust and safety. The Domme's actions could be seen as reckless, as she put the client in harm's way despite the client's explicit limits. Additionally, the Domme's retaliation by threatening to spread the word about non-payment seems inappropriate, especially since she was the one who didn't follow the agreed-upon safety protocols.\n\nThe friend's argument that the author should have paid regardless might stem from a perspective that the Domme was following her own interpretation of pushing limits, but in BDSM, consent and agreed boundaries are paramount. Ignoring a safe word is a serious breach, and the client's right to safety and consent should take precedence over payment. The author's decision to prioritize their health and not pay under those circumstances is understandable. The Domme's equipment being broken was a result of the author's distress, which was caused by the Domme's actions. Therefore, the author isn't at fault for the broken restraints.\n\nIn conclusion, the Domme's actions were the primary issue here. The author followed the agreed-upon safe word, and the Domme failed to respect that, leading to injury. The author's refusal to pay is a justified response to the breach of trust and safety, so the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
