I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they arranged a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit out of $350 total. They set up a safe word system using a ball in their hand. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed medium power, even after the user dropped the ball (their safe word), and continued for three more kicks. The user ended up in a lot of pain, broke a restraint, and then the Domme yelled at them for damaging the equipment and demanded payment. The user refused to pay, went to the hospital, and their friend, who's also a Domme, is telling them they should have paid.\n\nSo, the key points here are: prior agreement on limits and safe words, the Domme ignoring the safe word, causing harm, and then the user refusing payment. \n\nIn BDSM communities, safety is a big deal. Safe words are supposed to be respected to prevent harm. If the Domme ignored the safe word, which the user clearly indicated, that's a major breach of trust and safety. The user's health and well-being should come first. The fact that the Domme continued after the safe word was triggered could be considered negligence or even assault, depending on jurisdiction.\n\nThe user's friend, another Domme, is saying they should have paid, but maybe she's not considering the violation of the safe word. In consensual activities, both parties have agreed terms, and if one party violates those, the other isn't obligated to fulfill their part of the agreement. The user was harmed, so they have a right to prioritize their health over the payment. Also, the broken restraints were a result of the Domme's actions, so maybe the cost of that should be on her, not the sub.\n\nLegally, if the user can prove the Domme ignored the safe word leading to injury, they might have a case. Ethically, the Domme's behavior was wrong, so not paying makes sense. The user isn't at fault here. They followed the agreed-upon safety measures, and the Domme didn't. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
