I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a domination session where they didn't pay a domme because she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author set up a session with clear terms, including a safe word system involving a ball. The domme went beyond the agreed-upon intensity, ignored the safe word when the ball was dropped, continued the punishment, causing severe pain and injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300 and got medical attention. The domme is threatening to report them to the community for non-payment.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The safe word is a fundamental part of any consensual power exchange, especially in BDSM. The domme's responsibility is to respect the sub's limits. By ignoring the safe word, she violated the trust and safety agreement. The author's refusal to pay arises from her breach of the agreed terms, not just because they didn't like the experience. \n\nAlso, the author got injured and sought medical help, which adds to the severity. The domme's response was to accuse the author of not paying and damaging her equipment, which shifts blame. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical contracts, if there was an explicit agreement that the safe word would be honored, and she didn't follow through, the author isn't obligated to pay. The domme's actions could even be considered negligent or harmful, depending on jurisdiction. However, legally, it's complicated. Ethically, though, the domme acted unprofessionally by ignoring the safe word. \n\nThe friend's argument that the author should pay because the domme pushed limits is problematic. Pushing limits isn't acceptable if it violates safety words. The author's health and safety should come first. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay because the domme didn't follow the agreed safety protocols, leading to harm. The ethical responsibility lies with the domme to ensure the session stays within consensual bounds. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
