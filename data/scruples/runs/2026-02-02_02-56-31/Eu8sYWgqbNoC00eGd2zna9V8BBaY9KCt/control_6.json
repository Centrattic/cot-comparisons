I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) who didn't get paid after the author ignored their safe word during a session. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author paid a deposit of $50 for a $350 session. They agreed on a safe word system using a ball\u2014they would hold it, and dropping it would mean stop. The Domme allegedly ignored the safe word, kept kicking them after they dropped the ball, leading to injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and is being accused by the Domme of being a problem.\n\nNow, considering the ethical implications. In BDSM, safe words are crucial. The community typically emphasizes consent and safety. If the Domme didn't respect the safe word, that's a major breach of trust and safety protocols. The author's main argument is that the Domme didn't follow agreed-upon limits, leading to harm. \n\nHowever, the author didn't pay the full amount, which the Domme might argue was part of the agreement. But if the service was not delivered as agreed\u2014specifically, the safety protocols were violated\u2014then the author might not be obligated to pay. Also, the Domme's reaction of threatening to ruin the author's reputation in the community could be seen as unethical, as it's retaliation.\n\nThe friend (also a Domme) says the author is a \"huge asshole\" for not paying, but that might be from a different perspective where the contract (payment) is prioritized over the safety breach. However, in ethical terms, ensuring safety and respecting boundaries is paramount. The author had the right to withhold payment if the service was not performed as agreed, especially with potential harm caused.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they were a victim of a safety violation, and not paying in that case is justified. The Domme's actions were the issue here.\n"
