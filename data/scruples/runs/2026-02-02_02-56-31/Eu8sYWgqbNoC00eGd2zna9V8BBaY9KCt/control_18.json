I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a paid session with a domme (Dominatrix) where the author didn't pay because the domme ignored his safe word. The safe word was dropping a ball, which he did, but she continued the activity. He ended up injured, went to the hospital, and refused to pay, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the agreed-upon safe word and the terms of the session. The author set a safe word that was supposed to halt the session immediately. The domme's failure to adhere to that could be a breach of agreed terms. Also, the author's injury might be a result of the domme exceeding their agreed limits.\n\nThe domme might argue that pushing limits is part of the role, but the author clearly stated his maximum limit was medium power. She went beyond that, leading to harm. The safe word being ignored is a critical issue here. In consensual activities, especially those involving pain or risk, respecting the safe word is paramount for safety. If the domme didn't honor that, it's a serious problem.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is an asshole for not paying might be from the perspective that payment is due regardless, but if the domme violated the agreed safety protocols, the author's refusal to pay could be justified. The broken restraints also might be the domme's fault if they broke due to her actions, so she should bear the cost of that.\n\nLegally and ethically, if someone enters a contract (even informal) with specific terms, and one party breaches those terms, the other may have grounds to withhold payment. The author's health and safety are also a factor. If the domme's actions led to injury, she could be negligent, and the author is not obligated to pay for a service that resulted in harm.\n\nSo, considering the safe word violation, the injury, and the breach of agreed terms, the author isn't in the wrong. The domme's actions were the primary issue. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
