I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a dominatrix after she ignored their safe word during a session. \n\nFirst, the setup: They paid a deposit, set clear limits (medium power max), and agreed on a safe word (dropping a ball). The domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, caused significant pain, and then expected the remaining payment. The user refused to pay because of this, and now their friend (another domme) is saying they should have paid.\n\nSo, key points here. The user set clear boundaries. The domme didn't respect the safe word, which is a fundamental safety measure in such activities. By continuing past the safe word, she breached the agreed terms. The user was in physical distress, ended up in the hospital, and refused payment. The domme is now threatening the user's reputation in the community for non-payment, which seems like a retaliation for the user not being complicit in her negligence.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, when someone agrees to a contract (even informal) and one party breaches it (in this case, the domme), the other party isn't obligated to fulfill their part. The user's safety was compromised, and the domme's actions could be considered negligence or even assault. The user's decision not to pay is a response to a breach of trust and safety. The friend's argument that the user should pay despite the domme's actions is flawed because it ignores the domme's responsibility to adhere to the agreed limits and safety protocols. \n\nAdditionally, the user's friend being a domme might have a biased perspective, possibly defending the profession's standards without considering the violation here. The user's primary concern was their health and safety, which is valid. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for withholding payment after the domme's failure to respect the safe word and the resulting harm.\n"
