I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The situation involves a consensual power exchange scenario, but things went wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user set up a session with clear terms: $350 total, $50 deposit. They discussed their limits, which were light to medium ballbusting. The domme used restraints and a ball gag, and they had a safe word system involving a ball. The user dropped the ball as a signal to stop, but the domme continued, causing significant injury. The user then refused to pay the remaining $300, citing the domme's failure to adhere to the agreed-upon safe word and the resulting harm.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, consensual activities require both parties to respect boundaries and agreed-upon limits. The safe word system is crucial in such scenarios to ensure the sub's safety. The domme's disregard for the safe word after the user dropped the ball could be considered a breach of trust and possibly negligence. The injury sustained by the user is a serious consequence of this breach.\n\nThe friend who is also a domme argues that the user should still pay because the domme pushed their limits. However, the key issue here is the violation of the safe word agreement. Pushing limits is part of the dynamic, but not when it leads to ignoring explicit signals to stop. The user's refusal to pay is a response to the domme's failure in their role, which is to ensure the sub's safety and well-being.\n\nFinancial responsibility comes into play here. The user paid a deposit, but the session didn't go as agreed. The domme's actions that led to the injury could be argued to have voided the contract, especially if the terms included adherence to the safe word. The user's physical well-being and the cost of medical treatment are also factors; the domme's negligence contributed to the need for hospital care.\n\nHowever, there's a counter-argument that by entering the session, the user implicitly agreed to pay, regardless of the outcome. Some might say that in adult consensual activities, once the session starts, the agreed-upon payment is expected, even if things go wrong. But that perspective might not account for the violation of safety protocols, which are fundamental to such arrangements.\n\nThe domme's response to the situation\u2014threatening to spread the user's name in the community\u2014adds another layer. This could be seen as harassment or intimidation, further supporting the user's stance that the domme acted improperly.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's refusal to pay is justified given the domme's failure to respect the safe word, resulting in injury. The domme's responsibility to uphold the agreed safety measures was breached, making the user not at fault.\n"
