I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by going through the details carefully.\n\nThe user set up a session with a domme for $350, but only paid a $50 deposit upfront. The domme didn't ask for the full payment beforehand, which is unusual. They discussed limits, and the user specified medium power max for ballbusting. They agreed on a safe word, which was dropping a ball. During the session, the domme went beyond the agreed limits by kicking and kneeing hard. The user dropped the ball (the safe word signal) but she kept going for three more kicks. He ended up in severe pain, broke the restraints, and had to leave. The domme then demanded payment and threatened to ruin his reputation in the community. The user refused to pay because of the violation of the safe word and the dangerous behavior, and his friend (a domme) is telling him he's an asshole for not paying.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and safety. The user had set clear limits and a safe word. The domme ignored the safe word, which is a fundamental part of any consensual power exchange. The safe word is there to stop the session immediately when the sub is in too much pain or danger. By ignoring it, the domme violated the agreed-upon boundaries. This could be considered assault, depending on the jurisdiction, because she continued after the safe word was used.\n\nNext, the payment issue. The user paid $50 upfront, and the total was $350. Even if the domme didn't ask for the full amount upfront, the session was agreed upon for $350. However, the domme failed to provide the service as per the agreed terms\u2014they had a specific plan with limits and safety protocols. By going beyond those limits and ignoring the safe word, the session was not completed as negotiated. The user's refusal to pay could be justified because the service was not provided correctly, and there was a breach of trust and safety.\n\nThen there's the friend's opinion. The friend is a domme and says the user should have paid. But in this case, the domme's actions went beyond what was agreed. If a domme doesn't respect the sub's limits and safe word, that's a major red flag. The friend might be biased, thinking that pushing limits is part of the role, but that's not the case when it's against the sub's explicit boundaries.\n\nAlso, the user ended up in the hospital, which shows that the domme's actions led to potential harm. The user had a valid reason to not pay because the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to injury and the need for medical attention.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the domme is at fault for not respecting the safe word and exceeding the limits. The user followed all the steps: communicated his limits, set a safe word, and used it when necessary. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for not paying, especially since the session was not conducted as agreed and resulted in harm.\n"
