I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a Domme and a sub. The user paid a deposit, set up a session with specific limits. The Domme ignored the safe word, causing him serious pain and injury, then expected the remaining payment. He didn't pay and is being told by a friend (also a Domme) that he should have paid.\n\nFirst, in BDSM, the safe word is crucial. It's supposed to ensure that the sub can stop any activity immediately. The user clearly set up the safe word as dropping the ball. When he dropped it, the Domme didn't stop. That's a big issue. Safety is paramount here. If the Domme didn't respect the safe word, that's a violation of trust and safety protocols. So maybe the user was justified in not paying because the Domme didn't follow agreed-upon rules.\n\nThen there's the physical harm. The user ended up with swollen testicles and had to go to the hospital. Even if it wasn't permanent, the Domme's actions led to injury. In that case, the user might not be obligated to pay for a service that resulted in harm, especially since the Domme breached the agreed terms.\n\nThe Domme is now threatening to report him for non-payment and losing her equipment. But the user broke the restraints in self-defense due to the pain and danger. The restraints breaking could be considered an accident due to the Domme's negligence. So the user might not be responsible for that damage.\n\nThe friend Domme says the user is in the wrong for not paying. But maybe she's not considering that the Domme didn't follow the safe word and caused harm. In consensual power exchange, the Dom is supposed to respect the sub's limits. If the Dom ignores the safe word, the sub isn't obligated to pay for a session that was conducted recklessly or dangerously.\n\nLegally, if the Domme didn't provide the service as agreed (ignoring the safe word and causing injury), the user might not have to pay. Also, in some jurisdictions, causing harm could be a civil issue. But the question is more about moral/ethical duty. Since the Domme didn't uphold her end of the agreement, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying. The user's health and safety come first. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
