I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who paid a domme for a session, and she ignored his safe word during a ballbusting session. He didn't pay the remaining money and now is being criticized by his friend who's also a domme. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The user set up the session with clear limits\u2014medium power max. The domme agreed, but then went beyond that. He used a safe word system (holding a ball), which he dropped when in pain, but she kept going. That seems like a breach of their agreement. \n\nThe domme then yelled at him for breaking the restraints and demanded the remaining payment. He refused because she didn't respect the safe word and he was injured. His friend says he's wrong because the domme was just pushing limits and he should pay and compensate for the broken equipment.\n\nIn BDSM, safe words are crucial. If a domme ignores the safe word, that's a serious issue. The author's actions were in response to a violation of their agreed-upon terms. The domme's behavior could be considered negligent or even abusive. \n\nThe financial aspect: he paid a deposit, and she didn't ask for upfront payment. By not paying the rest, he's withholding payment for a service not rendered properly. The broken restraints might be her responsibility if they broke due to her actions beyond the agreed limits. \n\nSo, the author's refusal to pay could be justified because the domme didn't follow the agreed terms and he was harmed. His friend's argument that he should pay might be from a different perspective, maybe valuing the contract over the safety violation. \n\nBut in standard contracts, if a service isn't provided as agreed, the client isn't obligated to pay. Since the domme didn't adhere to the limits and caused injury, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying. The domme's threat to report him for non-payment seems invalid given the circumstances.\n"
