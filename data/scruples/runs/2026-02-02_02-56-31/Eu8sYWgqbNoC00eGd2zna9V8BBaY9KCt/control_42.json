I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Domme session where the author didn't pay because the Domme ignored his safe word. The key points are the safe word being ignored and the resulting injury.\n\nFirst, the safe word system is crucial in any consensual power exchange or kink play. The author set up a safe word where dropping the ball meant she should stop immediately. After he dropped the ball three times, she didn't stop, leading to him being seriously hurt. That's a major breach of the agreed-upon safety measures. The Domme's responsibility is to respect the sub's limits and stop at the safe word. If she didn't, that's a problem.\n\nThen there's the payment issue. The author gave a $50 deposit and arranged to pay the remaining $300 later. The Domme, after the incident, demands payment. But if she didn't follow the agreed terms (safe word), the author might not be obligated to pay for a service that wasn't provided as contracted. The sub's safety comes first, so if the Domme violated the terms, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying.\n\nAlso, the Domme's reaction\u2014yelling, threatening to report him, and talking about the equipment damage\u2014seems harsh. The author was harmed, and the Domme is holding the payment as leverage. That's a misuse of power. The friend who's a Domme says he should have paid, but that might be a conflict of interest. The main issue is the safe word violation, which is a non-negotiable part of consent.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, if someone breaches the agreed-upon terms, the other party isn't obligated to fulfill their part of the contract. The author's priority was his health, which is valid. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the Domme didn't honor the safe word, leading to harm, and the author isn't responsible for paying when the service was not provided as agreed.\n"
