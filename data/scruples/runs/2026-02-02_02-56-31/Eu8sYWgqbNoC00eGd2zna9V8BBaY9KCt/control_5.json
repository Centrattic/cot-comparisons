I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault (AITA) for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details of the situation. The author set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, and discussed their limits. They agreed on a safe word system using a ball in their hand. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, causing significant pain. The author dropped the ball (the safe word signal) but the Domme didn't stop, leading to more pain and injury. The author then left without paying the remaining $300, broke a restraint, and the Domme threatened to report them.\n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon limits and the safe word. The Domme violated the agreed-upon terms by not stopping when the safe word was triggered, which is a fundamental rule in such activities. The author's decision not to pay could be seen as a refusal to pay for a service that was not delivered as agreed. The Domme was supposed to respect the agreed limits and the safe word, which she didn't. \n\nHowever, the author did break the restraint and the Domme is claiming financial loss from that. The author's friend, also a Domme, argues that the author should pay regardless. But if the Domme failed to follow the agreed safety protocols, then the author isn't at fault for not paying. The service wasn't provided as contracted because the Domme didn't adhere to the terms they set. Additionally, the author was harmed, which is a serious issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme didn't honor the agreement and caused harm. The author's friend's opinion might be biased as a fellow Domme, but the core issue is the violation of the safe word and the resulting harm. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
