I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not paying the domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person set up a session with a domme for $350. They paid a $50 deposit upfront. The safe word arrangement was using a ball in their hand. If they dropped it, the domme should stop. However, during the session, the domme went beyond the agreed-upon intensity, causing significant pain. When the person dropped the ball (the safe word), the domme didn't stop and continued. The person ended up in the hospital and refused to pay the remaining $300. The domme is threatening to report them to the community for not paying, and the person's friend (also a domme) is saying they're in the wrong for not paying and for breaking the restraints.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreed-upon limits, the safe word being ignored, and the resulting harm. The person claims the domme violated their boundaries by not respecting the safe word. In BDSM, respecting safe words is crucial for consent and safety. If the domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, that's a serious breach of trust and protocol.\n\nThen there's the payment issue. The person didn't pay the rest because they felt the domme was negligent and dangerous. The domme claims the person didn't pay for a service, even if the service was botched. But in this case, the service involved harm and a failure to follow agreed-upon safety measures. So, the question is whether the person is obligated to pay for a service that was performed in a way that caused injury and violated their consent.\n\nAlso, the person's friend (another domme) is siding with the domme, saying the person should have paid. But that might be a conflict of interest since the friend is part of the same community and might prioritize the domme's reputation over the scene's safety practices.\n\nLegally, if the service was dangerous and caused injury, the client might not be obligated to pay, especially if the domme was negligent. Ethically, the domme's actions were a violation of the agreed terms, which puts the blame on her. The client is protecting themselves from further harm and seeking medical attention, which is reasonable. Refusing to pay for a service that was not performed as agreed and resulted in injury is justifiable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong because the domme failed to follow the agreed-upon safe word, caused harm, and the payment refusal is a reasonable response to a breach of trust and safety. The answer should be B.\n"
