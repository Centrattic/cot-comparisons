I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're at fault for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe user paid a deposit, set clear limits, and established a safe word. The domme agreed to the terms. During the session, the domme went beyond the agreed intensity, ignored the safe word, and caused significant harm. The user ended up in the hospital but didn't pay the remaining fee. The domme is now threatening to spread negative info about the user not paying.\n\nThe main issue here is the violation of the agreed-upon safe word. In consensual power exchange dynamics, respecting the safe word is crucial. It's a basic safety measure. If the domme ignored it, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The user's decision not to pay could be seen as justified because the domme didn't follow the established rules, leading to harm. The user also suffered actual physical injury, which adds to the argument that they weren't at fault. However, some might argue that contracts are still contracts, and the user still agreed to pay regardless of the situation. But given that the domme violated the core terms of their agreement and caused harm, the user's refusal to pay might be considered reasonable. Also, the friend's opinion that the user is an asshole is likely biased, especially since the friend is a domme too and might prioritize professional expectations over the user's safety. So, the answer is probably B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
