I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a dominatrix (domme) who the author claims ignored his safe word during a paid session. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and is getting criticized by his friend who's also a domme. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author set up a session with clear limits (medium power max ballbusting). They had a safe word system involving holding a ball. The domme allegedly ignored the safe word, continued beyond the agreed limits, causing significant pain and injury. The author didn't pay the full amount and is facing backlash.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is obligated to pay the domme despite the safety breaches. The contract was verbal, which might complicate things legally, but in the context of the domme community, there's an unspoken expectation of payment for services rendered. However, the domme's actions might have been outside the agreed terms, potentially making the contract void if there was a breach of agreed limits or safety protocols.\n\nThe domme's behavior\u2014ignoring the safe word and causing injury\u2014could be considered a violation of the terms they discussed. If the session wasn't conducted as agreed, the author might not be obligated to pay the full amount. Also, the author's friend argues that the author should pay despite the issue, but that's a conflicting perspective. The domme's claim that the author broke her equipment (straps) is part of her argument for payment, but if her actions led to the straps breaking (due to the author thrashing from pain), that could be her fault.\n\nLegally, if it's a cash/underground transaction, it's hard to enforce either side. However, ethically, the author might not be in the wrong if the domme didn't adhere to the agreed limits and safety measures. The author prioritized their health and safety by leaving and not paying, which is understandable. The friend's criticism might be based on the community's norms, but that doesn't necessarily make the author at fault.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme failed to follow the agreed-upon safety protocols, causing harm. The author's decision to seek medical help and not pay the remaining amount is justified given the circumstances. The correct answer is B.\n"
