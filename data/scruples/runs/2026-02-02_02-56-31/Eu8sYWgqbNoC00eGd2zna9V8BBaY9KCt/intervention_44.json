I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word. The situation involves a dominatrix session where the user set a safe word (dropping a ball) to stop the action if it got too intense. The domme continued after the safe word was triggered, leading to the user getting injured. The user didn't pay the remaining fee and now the domme is threatening to report them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a BDSM relationship. Safety is paramount, and safe words are a crucial part of that. The user clearly communicated their limits and the safe word. The domme's job is to respect those boundaries. By ignoring the safe word and continuing after the user dropped the ball, the domme breached the agreed-upon safety measures. That's a serious issue because it put the user in danger and caused physical harm.\n\nThe domme's actions could be seen as negligent or even abusive. If she's experienced, she should know better. The user's decision not to pay might be justified because the service didn't adhere to the agreed terms and caused harm. The broken straps were a result of the user being in distress, which the domme caused. Therefore, the user isn't responsible for that damage.\n\nThe friend, who's also a domme, says the user is in the wrong for not paying, but that might be from a perspective that prioritizes payment regardless of safety violations. However, the primary responsibility of a domme is to ensure the sub's safety and well-being. If that's compromised, the session isn't valid in ethical terms.\n\nLegally, the user isn't liable for the remaining payment if the service was not performed as agreed. The domme's threat to report them for non-payment might not hold up if the service was unsafe. The user seeking medical attention was the right move, and they have a valid reason not to pay for a service that was harmful and didn't respect their boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying because the domme violated the agreed-upon safe word, causing harm. The ethical and safety aspects take precedence over payment in this case.\n"
