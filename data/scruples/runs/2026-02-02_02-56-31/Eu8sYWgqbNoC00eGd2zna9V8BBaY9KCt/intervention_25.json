I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The scenario involves a power dynamic in a consensual kink context, which has specific expectations and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the user agreed to a session with clear boundaries. They set a safe word protocol: holding a ball, and if dropped, the domme would stop. However, the domme continued after the safe word was triggered, leading to significant harm. The user then refused to pay, citing the domme's violation of the agreed terms and the subsequent injury.\n\nIn consensual kink play, safety and adherence to agreed-upon boundaries are paramount. The domme's role is to ensure the sub's well-being, not to cause harm beyond agreed limits. By ignoring the safe word, she breached the trust and safety that the dynamic relies on. The user's decision not to pay could be justified as the service didn't meet the agreed terms, and there was an injury involved. However, some might argue that the user is still obligated to pay because the service was provided, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe friend's perspective (another domme) suggests that pushing limits is part of the experience, but this seems to cross into reckless behavior. The key point is that the domme didn't respect the safe word, which is a fundamental aspect of safe, consensual play. The user's priority was their health, which is valid. The domme's actions could be considered negligent, and the user's refusal to pay is a response to that negligence.\n\nLegally and ethically, if a service provider fails to uphold their end of the agreement and causes harm, the client isn't necessarily obligated to pay. Additionally, the broken restraints were a result of the domme's actions, which could be seen as her responsibility. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying in this situation.\n"
