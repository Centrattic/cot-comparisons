I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. \n\nFirst, the setup: The person paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session. They communicated their limits as medium power max. The Domme used restraints and a ball gag, which they agreed to. The safe word was dropping a ball to signal stopping. However, when the person dropped the ball, the Domme didn't stop and continued with more force, leading to severe pain and potential injury. The person then broke the restraints to protect themselves, got to the hospital, and refused to pay the remaining $300. The Domme is threatening to report them in the community.\n\nNow, the key points here. The safe word is a crucial agreement in consensual power exchange. If the Domme didn't stop upon the safe word being given, that's a breach of trust and safety. The person's health and safety are paramount. Even in a consensual scenario, the Domme's responsibility is to ensure the sub's well-being. If she ignored the safe word, she's violating the agreed terms, which could be considered a serious issue. \n\nThe friend (also a Domme) says the author is an asshole for not paying, arguing that the Domme pushed limits and the client broke her equipment. But pushing beyond agreed limits isn't appropriate. The client's action of not paying might be justified because the service didn't meet the agreed-upon safety standards. The client's right to their body and health should take precedence over paying for a session that was conducted unsafely. \n\nThe Domme's argument that she pushed the client's limits is a red flag. If the safe word was in place, she should have respected that. The client's breaking the restraints could be a result of the Domme's failure to adhere to the safety protocol. In such communities, respecting boundaries is non-negotiable. \n\nSo, the client isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay when the Domme didn't follow the agreed safety measures, which endangered their health. The Domme's actions were negligent, and the client's refusal to pay is a valid response to that breach of trust.\n"
