I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying the domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person arranged a session, paid a deposit, set a safe word (dropping a ball), but during the session the domme went beyond the agreed limits and didn't stop when the safe word was triggered. The person ended up in the hospital and refused to pay the remaining fee. The domme is threatening to report them to the community for not paying and damaging her equipment.\n\nSo, the key points here are the use of a safe word and the agreed limits. In any consensual power exchange, especially in activities with potential for harm, the safe word is crucial. It's meant to stop the activity immediately. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a major breach of trust and safety. \n\nThe person followed the protocol by setting the safe word and using it when the pain became too much. The domme, however, didn't respect that. The fact that the person ended up needing medical attention suggests that the domme's actions were negligent. \n\nNow, regarding payment. The person paid a deposit, but the main payment is for a session that wasn't conducted properly. If the domme didn't follow the agreed terms, then the person might not be obligated to pay the full amount. The deposit might be a different matter, but the main issue is the service provided. \n\nThe domme is now threatening to report the person for non-payment and equipment damage. However, the equipment damage could be a result of the person's distress due to the domme's actions. Also, the person isn't at fault for needing to use the safe word because the domme didn't respect their limits. \n\nIn consensual activities, the bottom's safety is paramount. The domme's responsibility is to ensure that the top's limits are respected. If she ignored the safe word and caused harm, she's at fault. The person is justified in not paying for a service that was not performed as agreed and that resulted in injury. \n\nThe friend who's also a domme says the person is an asshole for not paying, but that might be from a perspective that prioritizes the domme's profit over the safety and consent. However, in a legitimate consensual dynamic, the consent and safety protocols must be followed. \n\nTherefore, the person isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay after the domme violated the safe word agreement and caused injury. They were adhering to the agreed-upon safety measures, and the domme failed in her role.\n"
