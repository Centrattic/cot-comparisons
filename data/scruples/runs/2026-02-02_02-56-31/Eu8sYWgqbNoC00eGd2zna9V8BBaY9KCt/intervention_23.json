I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. The situation involves a consensual power exchange, but things went wrong when the Domme exceeded the agreed-upon limits and didn't stop when the safe word was triggered. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user set clear boundaries: light to medium ballbusting. The Domme, however, went beyond that, using more force than agreed. The safe word system was in place\u2014dropping a ball to signal stopping. But when the user dropped the ball, the Domme didn't stop, leading to severe pain and injury. \n\nThe Domme then expected payment despite not following the agreed terms. The user refused to pay, citing the breach of safety and the injury. The friend, who's also a Domme, says the user should have paid, arguing that pushing limits is part of the role and the user broke equipment.\n\nNow, in consensual activities like this, especially in kink communities, communication and respect for boundaries are crucial. The Domme's failure to adhere to the safe word and the user's limits seems to be a clear violation. The safe word is a fundamental part of ensuring safety, so ignoring it is a serious issue. The Domme also didn't stop when the user was in distress, which could be seen as negligence or even reckless behavior.\n\nRegarding payment, if the service provided didn't meet the agreed terms, the user might not be obligated to pay. The user suffered injury, which adds another layer\u2014possibly medical expenses and the need for emergency care. The Domme's actions could be considered negligent, so expecting payment in that scenario might be unreasonable.\n\nThe friend's argument that pushing limits is part of the role is questionable. The user explicitly stated their max limit, and the Domme went beyond that without consent. Pushing limits can be part of the dynamic, but only if done consensually and with check-ins. The user didn't consent to the level of force used. Also, the broken restraints might be due to the user's thrashing from pain, which the Domme caused, so holding the user responsible for that seems unfair.\n\nLegally, depending on the jurisdiction, the user might have a case if the Domme acted negligently. Ethically, the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, making the user's refusal to pay justifiable. The user's priority was their health, which is the most important aspect here.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. The Domme's actions were the breach, so the answer should be B.\n"
