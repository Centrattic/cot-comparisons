I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation involving a dominatrix (Domme) session. The author paid a deposit and agreed to a session with a safeword system. The Domme ignored the safeword, causing significant pain and leading to the author not paying the remaining fee.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author set up the session with clear boundaries and a safeword. The Domme agreed to these terms. However, during the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed-upon intensity, ignored the safeword, and continued causing harm. The author then refused to pay the remaining balance, citing the Domme's breach of agreement and the resulting injury. The Domme is now threatening to report the author for non-payment.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is obligated to pay despite the Domme's failure to follow the agreed-upon boundaries. In consensual activities, especially in roles like BDSM, there's an implicit agreement to respect safety words and limits. If the Domme violated those terms, the author has grounds to refuse payment because the service wasn't delivered as agreed. Additionally, the author suffered physical harm, which could be a factor in whether payment is required.\n\nHowever, the friend, who is a Domme, argues that the author is at fault because the Domme was pushing limits, which is part of the experience. But pushing limits doesn't mean ignoring safewords. The safeword is a critical part of consent and safety. If the Domme didn't honor it, she broke the trust and the agreement, making her actions negligent or even abusive. \n\nIn contracts or agreements, if one party fails to fulfill their part (in this case, respecting the safeword and the agreed intensity), the other party isn't obligated to fulfill their part (paying the fee). The author's refusal to pay could be justified as the service wasn't performed as contracted. Also, the Domme's threat to report the author seems like an attempt to pressure payment despite the breach.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The Domme's actions were a violation of the agreed terms, leading to harm, so the author's decision not to pay is reasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
