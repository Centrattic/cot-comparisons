I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. So, the user is asking if they should pay the Domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a safe word is. In BDSM, a safe word is an agreed-upon word or signal that allows a participant to communicate that they want the activity to stop immediately. It's a crucial part of consensual play to ensure safety and respect.\n\nIn the story, the user set up a session with a Domme, and they discussed limits, including using a ball in their hand as the safe word. When the user dropped the ball (the safe word signal), the Domme didn't stop and instead continued with more intense actions. This seems like a clear violation of the agreed terms. The user ended up in significant pain, had to break restraints to protect themselves, and then didn't pay the Domme because she didn't respect their safe word.\n\nThe Domme's response was to demand payment and accuse the user of not paying and damaging her equipment. The user's friend, who is also a Domme, says they should have paid regardless, but that seems conflicting with the principle of safe words. \n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect: the Domme's actions breached the trust and safety protocols. The user's refusal to pay is a response to this breach. Legally, the user might have paid for a service that was not delivered as agreed, especially since a key part of the agreement (safe word) was ignored. However, the situation is complex because it's within the context of a consensual adult activity with specific negotiated terms.\n\nIf the safe word wasn't followed, the user might not be obligated to pay, as the service was not provided in the agreed manner. The Domme, on the other hand, might have claims about the payment for the time and the damaged equipment. But if the user can show that the session was not conducted as per their agreements, they might have a valid reason not to pay.\n\nHowever, in some communities or contexts, there might be an unspoken expectation of payment regardless, which complicates things. The user's friend's reaction suggests that there's a different perspective within the Domme community, prioritizing payment and equipment over the safe word violation. But from an ethical standpoint, respecting the safe word is non-negotiable in BDSM practices. Ignoring it could be considered a serious violation, even if it's unintentional.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme failed to adhere to the agreed safety measures, which is a fundamental part of the session. The user's priority was their safety and health, which is justified over financial obligations in this case.\n"
