I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying the domme after the session.\n\nFirst, the context is a consensual power exchange scenario where the author and the domme agreed on a session. The author set a safe word (dropping a ball) to stop the session. However, the domme continued after the safe word was triggered, leading to the author experiencing significant pain and needing medical attention. The author then refused to pay the remaining fee and later had a friend, who's also a domme, say they were wrong for not paying.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The safe word system is fundamental in such relationships to ensure safety and consent. The domme's failure to respect the safe word could be a major breach of trust and safety protocols. The author's refusal to pay might be seen as a response to the domme's negligence, which endangered his well-being. However, the domme might argue that the session was agreed upon, and the author's actions (breaking the restraints and not paying) are unethical.\n\nBut the core issue is the violation of the agreed-upon safe word. In any consensual activity, especially one involving power dynamics and physical risk, respecting the safe word is non-negotiable. The domme's actions put the author in harm's way, which could be a serious issue. The author's decision to prioritize their health over payment might be justified given the breach of safety. The friend's criticism might stem from different community norms, but the primary responsibility lies with ensuring safety. So, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
