I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. They set clear limits beforehand, using a specific safe word system (holding a ball, dropping it if in pain). The Domme kept going past their stated medium limit, causing harm, and then the user didn't pay because she breached their safety. The Domme is now threatening to report them for non-payment, but the user argues that the Domme was negligent and dangerous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of consensual power exchange. Typically, in such arrangements, the Domme holds power, but the sub has the right to set and enforce boundaries. The safe word is supposed to be a non-negotiable agreement to ensure consent and safety. If the Domme ignored the safe word (the ball dropping), that's a serious violation of trust and safety. The user's health and well-being should be the priority. Even if the Domme claims she was just pushing their limits, the user clearly indicated their maximum was medium, and she went beyond that. Causing physical harm like doubling the size of the testicles is not acceptable and could be a sign of negligence or recklessness.\n\nThe user didn't pay the remaining $300 because the service wasn't performed safely. The Domme's response was to blame the user for breaking the restraints and not paying, but her initial failure to adhere to the safe word is the root issue. The user's friend, who's also a Domme, seems to side with the Domme, but maybe she's not considering the safety breach. Payment isn't owed if the agreed-upon terms (including safety) were not met. The user's decision to seek medical help was prudent, and their refusal to pay without clarification is understandable. The Domme's threats to report them are likely an attempt to pressure payment, which is unfair. So, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying in this case.\n"
