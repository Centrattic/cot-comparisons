I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme and a sub, with some issues around safety words and payment.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with a Domme for $350. They agreed on a safe word system where dropping a ball would be the signal to stop. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, kept going after the safe word was triggered, causing the author significant pain and injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300 because the Domme didn't respect the safe word, while the Domme claims they pushed the author's limits and the author is in the wrong for not paying and breaking her equipment.\n\nNow, considering the principles of consent and safety in BDSM. Safe words are crucial for communication, especially in consensual activities where one person is in a vulnerable position. The Domme's role is to respect the sub's boundaries and stop immediately if the safe word is used. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a violation of the agreed-upon terms and could be considered a breach of trust and safety. \n\nThe author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the Domme didn't adhere to the safety agreement, leading to harm. However, the payment was for a service, and if the session was conducted (even if improperly), there might be an argument about expectation of payment. But if the service was performed recklessly and caused injury, that complicates things. The author ended up needing medical attention, which the Domme might be responsible for.\n\nThe friend who is a Domme says the author is an asshole for not paying, but that might be from a perspective where the Domme believes she followed her role, even if pushing limits. However, pushing limits without respecting the safe word is a big issue. The author's actions to protect themselves by leaving and seeking medical help seem reasonable.\n\nSo, considering the Domme's actions were unsafe and disregarded the agreed-upon safe word, leading to injury, the author refusing payment isn't the wrong thing. The Domme's responsibility includes respecting the sub's limits and safety. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
