I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who paid a domme for a session, but the domme ignored their safe word, leading to injury. The author ended up not paying the remaining amount and is now being called out by friends for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The user set up a session with agreed-upon limits, specifically mentioning that the pain should be light to medium. The domme agreed to those limits and used restraints and a ball gag. The safe word was dropping a ball to signal stopping. However, the domme continued even after the safe word was triggered, causing significant pain and injury. The user didn't pay the remaining $300 and is facing backlash from the domme community.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. The domme's actions clearly went beyond the agreed limits and ignored the safe word, which is a fundamental part of any consensual power exchange. The user's immediate reaction was to go to the hospital, which is a valid concern for their health. \n\nThe domme is now claiming that the user should pay for the broken equipment and the session. But if the domme violated the agreed terms and caused harm, the user isn't obligated to pay. Especially since the session was supposed to be within certain limits that were broken. The user's decision not to pay could be justified because the service was not delivered as contracted and resulted in harm. However, there's a counterpoint that the user had agreed to the terms upfront, but the domme's actions were outside the agreed limits, making the contract invalid because the terms were not followed. \n\nAlso, the domme's reaction of threatening to blackball the user is problematic. In a consensual power dynamic, the sub has the right to their safety and limits. The domme's failure to respect that undermines the entire agreement. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed-upon safe words and caused harm. The user's refusal to pay is justified as the service wasn't performed as agreed, and the domme was negligent. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
