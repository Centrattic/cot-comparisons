I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user set up a session with a Domme for role-play involving ballbusting. They specified medium power max and established a safe word system where dropping a ball would mean the Domme should stop immediately. However, the Domme continued after the user dropped the ball, leading to significant injury. The user then refused to pay the remaining fee, citing the Domme's negligence and the resulting harm. The Domme is now threatening to report the user for non-payment and equipment damage. The user's friend, who's also a Domme, says the user is an asshole for not paying, but the user is questioning their right to do so.\n\nNow, I need to assess who's at fault here. The key points are the safe word agreement and the Domme's actions. In BDSM, communication and consent are paramount. The user made their limits clear and established a safe word. When the safe word was triggered, the Domme had a responsibility to stop immediately. By continuing after the user dropped the ball, she violated the agreed-upon safety measures. This could be considered negligence, especially since it led to injury. The user's refusal to pay could be seen as justified, as the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms, and the user suffered harm as a result.\n\nThe Domme's argument is that she was pushing the user's limits, which is part of the role. However, pushing limits shouldn't override the safety protocols. The user's friend might be emphasizing the importance of payment in the BDSM community, but that doesn't absolve the Domme of her responsibility. The user's actions in not paying could be seen as a self-protective measure, especially considering the physical harm incurred. The threat from the Domme to report the user in the community adds a layer of coercion, but the user's health and safety should be the priority.\n\nIn legal terms, if this were a contract, the terms were that the Domme would adhere to the safe word. By not doing so, she breached the contract. The user's non-payment could be a counterclaim for breach of contract or negligence. However, in the context of a private, consensual arrangement (assuming it's legal in their area), the ethical stance is more about mutual respect and safety. The user's friend might be more focused on the financial aspect, but the immediate issue is the violation of safety and the resulting harm.\n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to injury. The user prioritized their health and safety, which is the most important aspect in any consensual activity.\n"
