I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they paid a domme for a session, but she didn't stop when they used the safe word, leading to injury and them not paying the rest. \n\nFirst, the key points. The user set up a session with agreed limits\u2014medium power max. The domme didn't ask for payment upfront but got a $50 deposit. The safe word was dropping a ball, which the user did after the domme went beyond their agreed limits. The domme continued for three more kicks, causing serious pain and injury. The user then didn't pay the remaining $300, and the domme is threatening to spread negative info.\n\nNow, considering the terms of their agreement. The safe word is supposed to stop the session immediately. The user followed the protocol by dropping the ball, but the domme didn't stop. That's a violation of their agreed boundaries. The user was hurt and had to go to the hospital. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there's a contract or mutual agreement, both parties have to follow it. Since the domme breached the terms by not respecting the safe word, the user might have grounds to not pay. Also, the injury could be a factor. The user's friend (another domme) says the user is an asshole for not paying, but maybe she's biased or doesn't understand the breach of protocol.\n\nHowever, the user did agree to the session and the initial deposit. The domme might argue that the session was performed as per the agreement, but that's not the case here. The domme went beyond agreed limits and ignored the safe word, which is a major issue in BDSM practices. Safety, consent, and communication are paramount. By not stopping, the domme failed in her role. \n\nSo, the user not paying could be justified because the service was not delivered as per their mutual agreement. The domme's actions were unsafe, leading to injury. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
