I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a domme where the author didn't pay after the domme allegedly ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author paid a $50 deposit, set up a session for $350, and had a safe word agreement using a ball. During the session, the domme went beyond the agreed limits, ignored the safe word (the dropped ball), and continued causing severe pain. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300. The domme is now threatening to report the author for non-payment.\n\nThe domme's side, according to the friend, is that she was pushing the author's limits, which is part of the role. The friend thinks the author should still pay and didn't take responsibility for breaking the straps.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, services rendered would typically require payment unless there was a breach of contract or services. Here, the contract was a paid session with agreed terms. However, the domme allegedly violated the agreed-upon safe word, which is a critical part of the agreement. If the safe word was part of the contract and the domme ignored it, that could be a breach. The author may have the right to withhold payment due to non-performance as agreed. Additionally, if the author was injured, there might be health concerns, but they didn't report any permanent damage.\n\nEthically, the domme's actions were dangerous and ignored safety protocols, which is a serious issue. The author's refusal to pay could be justified as the service wasn't performed as agreed, and the author was harmed. However, in some services, especially adult services, the expectation is that payment is due regardless of the recipient's satisfaction, but consent and safety are paramount. If the domme violated safety terms, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying.\n\nThe key factors are the safety agreement and whether the domme honored it. If the safe word was part of the agreement and was ignored, the domme is at fault. The author's non-payment is a response to a breach of contract. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong."
