I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a Domme and a sub. The user paid a deposit for a session, set up a safe word using a ball in his hand, and agreed on limits. But during the session, the Domme continued past his safe word and caused significant harm. He didn't pay the remaining $300, and now his friend, who's also a Domme, is saying he's an asshole for not paying. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a Dom/sub relationship. Safe words are crucial for communication and consent. The user established a safe word (dropping the ball) which was supposed to stop the session immediately. The Domme didn't respect that, leading to injury. In such power exchange dynamics, the sub's consent and safety are paramount. The Domme's failure to honor the safe word could be a major breach of trust and protocol.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. He paid a deposit, but the service was not completed properly. The Domme caused damage to her equipment and the user was injured. If the session was not completed as agreed and the user felt violated, it might be reasonable not to pay the remaining amount. However, in some cases, people might argue that once the session starts, payment is expected regardless of issues, but this depends on prior agreements.\n\nThe user's friend, a Domme, is saying he's an asshole. But maybe she's biased or doesn't fully understand the situation where safe words were ignored. The key here is whether the user violated the agreed-upon boundaries. Since the Domme didn't follow the safe word, the user's refusal to pay might be justified because the service was not delivered as contracted. Additionally, the injury caused by her actions could be a factor. \n\nAnother angle: the user's main responsibility is to his own safety. If he was in pain and used the safe word, but the Domme ignored it, he's not at fault for protecting himself. The Domme's actions went beyond agreed limits, which is a serious issue. In a consensual power exchange, the Domme is supposed to respect the sub's limits and safe words. If she didn't, that's her fault, and the user is not wrong for not paying for a session that was not properly conducted.\n\nAlso, breaking the restraint might be an accident due to pain, so maybe the user isn't responsible for that. The Domme might need to replace the equipment, but if she caused the damage by not following the safe word, it's her responsibility. The user's priority was his health, which is understandable.\n\nSo putting it all together: the Domme failed to respect the safe word, caused harm, and the user didn't pay because the service was not properly executed. The user isn't in the wrong because the breach of protocol was on the Domme's side. The answer should be B (No).\n"
