I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user set up a session, agreed on limits, including a safe word, which was dropping a ball. The domme didn't stop when the safe word was used and continued beyond the agreed limits, causing harm. The user didn't pay the remaining money and is now being told by a friend (who's also a domme) that they should have paid.\n\nSo, the key points are: consent and boundaries. The user specified medium power max, but the domme went beyond that. The safe word was ignored, which is a major red flag. The user was hurt and had to go to the hospital. The domme then demanded payment and threatened to blackball them.\n\nIn the kink community, safety is paramount. Safe words are supposed to be respected. If a domme ignores the safe word, they're violating the agreed-upon boundaries, which is a serious issue. The user's health and safety should take precedence over payment. The domme is at fault here for not respecting the limit and causing harm. The user's decision not to pay could be justified because the service wasn't delivered as agreed. The friend's argument that the domme pushed limits is invalid because the user clearly communicated their limits, which were exceeded.\n\nAlso, the user didn't ask to end the session on their own; the domme was the one who ended it after the incident. The broken equipment was a result of the user defending themselves due to the pain. So, the domme's loss of equipment is due to her own actions. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
