I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a dominatrix after she ignored their safe word during a session. They paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session, got hurt when the Domme continued after they dropped the safe word (a ball), and ended up at the hospital. The Domme is now threatening to tell the community they didn't pay.\n\nFirst, the use of a safe word is crucial in BDSM. It's meant to immediately stop the activity if the submissive feels unsafe or exceeds their limits. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. The user's health and safety should come first, so not paying might be justified here.\n\nBut wait, they agreed to a deposit and the full payment. The user might be in a legal or ethical gray area if they committed to paying regardless of the outcome. However, the Domme's negligence led to potential harm. The user's friend, also a domme, says they should pay even if they didn't follow the safe word. That's a conflicting view. \n\nIn many BDSM communities, safety is paramount. A professional Domme should respect boundaries and safe words. The user was honest about their limits beforehand, and the Domme disregarded them. The user's priority was their well-being, which is understandable. The Domme's threats seem manipulative, possibly trying to guilt them into paying despite the violation.\n\nOn the other hand, contracts or verbal agreements might still require payment, but if the service was dangerous and didn't adhere to agreed terms, the user isn't obligated. Medical emergencies are a valid reason to terminate a session and withhold payment. The broken restraint could be a red flag about her competence.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health and not paying when the Domme didn't follow safety procedures. The Domme bears responsibility for not respecting the safe word and causing harm. The answer is B.\n"
