I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dominatrix (Domme) session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, and agreed on a medium power level for ballbusting. They established a safe word system using a ball in his hand. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, ignored the safe word (when he dropped the ball), continued causing harm, and then the author refused to pay the remaining $300, citing her negligence. The Domme threatened to report him to the community, and the author's friend, who's also a Domme, said he was an asshole for not paying.\n\nSo, the main issues here are consent, safety protocols, and payment terms. In BDSM, consent and safe words are crucial. The Domme violated the agreed-upon limits and ignored the safe word, which is a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service wasn't performed as agreed and resulted in injury. However, the deposit was non-refundable, and the Domme might expect payment for the session even if it was cut short. \n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, a safe word is part of the agreed contract, so the Domme might be liable for not following it, which could void the payment obligation. But if there was a contract specifying payment regardless, the author might be in a weaker position. However, the injury caused by the Domme's negligence could also be a factor. The author was harmed due to the Domme's actions, so there's a case for not paying as compensation for the harm caused. \n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is an asshole might stem from the expectation in the community that payment is due regardless of the session's outcome, but if the session was unsafe, that expectation might not hold. The key is whether the author has a legal or ethical right to withhold payment due to the breach of agreed terms and resulting harm. Since the Domme ignored the safe word, which is a critical part of the agreement, the author might have grounds to not pay. Additionally, the injury could be seen as a reason not to pay, as the service was not performed as intended and caused harm. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed-upon boundaries and ignored the safe word, leading to injury. The refusal to pay is a reasonable response to her negligence.\n"
