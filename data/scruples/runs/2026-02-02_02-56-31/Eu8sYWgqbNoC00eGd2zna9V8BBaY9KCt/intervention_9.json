I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The situation involves a lot of pain and a medical scare, which is concerning.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of ethical and safe practices in BDSM. Consent is crucial, and participants must respect each other's boundaries and safe words. The safe word system is a fundamental safety measure. In this case, the user had a specific safe word using a ball, and when they dropped it, the Domme didn't stop. Instead, she continued, causing severe pain and injury. That's a major breach of trust and safety protocols. \n\nNow, the user didn't pay the remaining $300 because they felt they weren't provided with a safe environment. The Domme, on the other hand, claims that she was just pushing their limits, which is part of her job, and that the user is in the wrong for not paying and damaging her equipment. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, even though there's a personal agreement, services rendered under unsafe conditions might not require payment, especially if there was harm caused. Ethically, the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, which is a big deal. The user's friend, another Domme, says the user is an asshole for not paying, but that's coming from someone who might not fully understand the severity of the situation. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. In some adult role-playing contexts, there's an expectation that the Domme knows their limits and can push them safely. But the user had clearly communicated their max level as medium, and the Domme escalated to full force. The safe word system is meant to stop the session immediately, so not abiding by it is unprofessional and unethical. \n\nThe user's right to their safety is paramount. They weren't just exaggerating; they ended up in the hospital. The Domme's response of yelling and demanding payment instead of being concerned about the user's health is inappropriate. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a tricky part. The user paid a $50 deposit, and the Domme didn't ask for payment upfront. But if the service wasn't provided properly and caused harm, then the user might not be obligated to pay. Plus, the Domme's threat to ruin the user's reputation for not paying could be seen as retaliation. \n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated safety agreements and caused potential harm. The user had the right to seek medical attention and not pay for a service that was dangerous and breached their consent.\n"
