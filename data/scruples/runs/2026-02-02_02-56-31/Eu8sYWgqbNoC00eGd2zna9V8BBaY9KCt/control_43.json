I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid domination session where the domme ignored the safe word, leading to injury.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author agreed to a session with specific limits, set a safe word (dropping a ball), and the domme continued after the safe word was triggered. The author didn't pay the remaining fee and is being criticized by another domme for not paying.\n\nLegally and ethically, if the domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocols, the author isn't obligated to pay. The safe word is a critical part of any consensual power exchange. Ignoring it breaches the contract and the trust. The injury could have been worse, so the author prioritizing health is justified.\n\nThe domme's actions were negligent. Even if the author broke restraints, it was in self-defense to stop the pain. The domme's claim about losing money from broken equipment is secondary to the harm caused. The author's decision to not pay and seek medical help is reasonable. The friend's judgment is misplaced; the domme was at fault for not respecting boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
