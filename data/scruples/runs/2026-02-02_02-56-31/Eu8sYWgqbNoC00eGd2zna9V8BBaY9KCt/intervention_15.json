I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) who didn't stop when the safe word was triggered. The person paid a deposit and set up a session with clear limits. The Domme didn't stop when the safe word was used, leading to injury and the person not paying the remaining fee. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a safe word is in BDSM. A safe word is agreed upon before a session to stop the activity immediately if either party is uncomfortable. The user mentioned using a ball as a safe word\u2014if it drops, she stops. But when he dropped it after the third kick, she didn't stop. That's a major issue because the safe word is supposed to be respected.\n\nThe Domme also went beyond the agreed limits (medium power max) by using full force. That's a breach of the initial agreement. The user ended up in the hospital, which is a serious outcome. The fact that the Domme didn't stop despite the safe word being triggered shows negligence. \n\nThe user didn't pay the remaining $300, which the Domme is upset about. The user's friend, who's a Domme, says he should have paid regardless. But in BDSM communities, there's an emphasis on consent and safety. If the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms and caused harm, the user isn't obligated to pay. Also, the user broke some equipment, but that was a result of the Domme's actions. \n\nLegally, if someone causes harm through negligence, they can't expect payment. The user isn't at fault for not paying because the service was unsafe and harmful. The Domme's reaction of threatening to blackball the user is also problematic, as it's retaliation without considering her own fault. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the user isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed terms and safety protocols, leading to injury. The user's refusal to pay is justified as the service was not properly rendered.\n"
