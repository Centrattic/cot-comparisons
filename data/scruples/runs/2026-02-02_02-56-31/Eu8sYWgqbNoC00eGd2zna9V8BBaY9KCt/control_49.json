I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Domme session gone wrong. The author paid a deposit and didn't pay the rest because the Domme ignored his safe word. He got hurt and went to the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the contract or agreement. They set up a session for $350, paid $50 upfront. The Domme didn't ask for payment upfront, which is unusual. The user had clear limits communicated, and the Domme went beyond them, ignoring the safe word. The safe word system is crucial in such activities for safety. The Domme's actions led to injury, so there's potential liability here.\n\nThe user didn't pay the remaining $300 because the Domme breached the agreed-upon terms. The friend (who is also a Domme) says he's in the wrong for not paying and for breaking the restraints. But the user's main issue is the Domme not respecting the safe word, causing harm. \n\nLegally, if someone provides a service but doesn't adhere to agreed terms and causes harm, the client might not be obligated to pay. Also, the user was injured, which could be a factor. The Domme's actions could be seen as negligence, especially if she ignored the safe word system they had in place. \n\nHowever, the user did break the restraints, which might be a point against him. But if the restraints broke due to the force of the kicks, that's on the Domme's actions. The user's friend's opinion is that he's an asshole for not paying, but that's from another Domme's perspective, possibly valuing payment over safety. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the Domme's actions were the problem. The user had a right to his safe word being respected. The user's decision not to pay could be justified as the service was not delivered as agreed, and he was harmed. The threat from the Domme to expose him in the community is also a red flag, suggesting possible harassment. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed-upon boundaries, caused harm, and the user's action to withhold payment is a response to that breach. The broken restraints might be an accident due to the force used, which the Domme is responsible for. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
