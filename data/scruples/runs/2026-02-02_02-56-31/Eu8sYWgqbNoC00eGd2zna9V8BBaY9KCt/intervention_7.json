I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. \n\nFirst, the setup: They paid a deposit, discussed limits, and had a safe word system using a ball. The Domme went beyond the agreed limits, kept going after the safe word was triggered, causing significant pain and injury. The user didn't pay the remaining fee and got a negative reaction from the Domme and a friend who's also a domme.\n\nSo, the key points here are the safe word protocol and the agreed-upon limits. In BDSM, communication and consent are crucial. The safe word is supposed to stop the session immediately if the sub is in too much pain or distress. By continuing after the safe word was activated, the Domme violated the agreed terms. The user's health and safety should take precedence over payment. \n\nThe Domme's argument is that she pushed the user's limits, but that's not how it's supposed to work. Limits are set for a reason, and pushing past them without consent is a breach of trust and safety. Also, the user was injured, which could have long-term consequences. \n\nThe friend's reaction that the user is an asshole for not paying seems to not consider the safety violation. The user was justified in not paying because the service wasn't rendered properly and it resulted in harm. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They prioritized their health and safety, which is right. The Domme is at fault for not respecting the safe word and causing injury. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
