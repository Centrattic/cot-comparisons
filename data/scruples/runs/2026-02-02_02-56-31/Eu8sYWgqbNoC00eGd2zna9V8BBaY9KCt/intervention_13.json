I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The scenario involves a consensual power exchange arrangement, but it seems like the domme didn't respect the agreed-upon safeword, leading to injury. \n\nFirst, the user paid a deposit and set clear limits, including the safe word. The domme agreed to those terms. When the user dropped the ball (the safe word trigger), the domme didn't stop, causing harm. This is a violation of the agreed-upon safety measures. \n\nThe domme then demanded the remaining payment despite the incident. The user refused to pay because the domme didn't follow the safety protocols and caused injury. The user's friend, another domme, argues they should have paid regardless. \n\nIn consensual relationships, especially in kink or fetish play, communication and respect for boundaries are crucial. The domme's actions breached the trust and safety, which are foundational. The user's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service was not performed as agreed, and there was harm caused. \n\nThe domme's claim about losing money from broken equipment is secondary to the user's right to safety. The user prioritized their health, which is essential. The domme's threat to spread negative information might be considered harassment, but the main issue is the violation of the safe word.\n\nSo, based on the agreement and the breach of safety, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying.\n"
