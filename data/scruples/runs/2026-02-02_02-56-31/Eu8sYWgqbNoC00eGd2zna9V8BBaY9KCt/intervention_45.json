I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Domme session where the person didn't pay after the Domme ignored their safe word. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the user set up a session with a Domme for $350, paying a $50 deposit upfront. They discussed their limits for ballbusting, specifying medium max. The Domme agreed to restrain and ball gag them, and they set up a safe word system using a ball in their hand. When the user dropped the ball (the safe word), the Domme didn't stop immediately and continued kicking, causing significant pain. The user ended up in the hospital, and then refused to pay the remaining $300, leading to the Domme threatening to report them to the community.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is at fault. The main issues here are consent, safe words, and contractual obligations. \n\n1. **Consent and Safe Words**: In any BDSM activity, consent and clear communication are crucial. The user set clear boundaries and a safe word system. The Domme, however, ignored the safe word (the dropped ball) and continued beyond the agreed limits. This is a serious breach of trust and safety. The user's health and well-being should take precedence over the financial agreement.\n\n2. **Physical Harm and Medical Attention**: The user suffered enough pain to go to the hospital, which indicates that the session went beyond what was agreed. The Domme's actions could be considered negligent or even abusive, especially since she continued after the safe word was triggered.\n\n3. **Financial Responsibility**: The Domme argues that the user should pay for the session and the damaged equipment. However, since the session was conducted in a harmful manner that the user explicitly warned against, the responsibility for the damage and the user's refusal to pay could lie with the Domme. The user isn't obligated to pay for a service that was performed in a way that violated their agreed-upon limits and caused harm.\n\n4. **Threats and Retaliation**: The Domme's reaction of threatening to report the user for non-payment seems like an attempt to exert control, which is counter to the principles of mutual respect and safety in consensual activities.\n\nThe friend who is also a Domme says the user is an asshole for not paying, but that perspective might be biased, especially if she's part of the same community where the Domme could retaliate. The user's primary concern was their health and safety, which were jeopardized by the Domme's actions. In such cases, the well-being of the individual should be the priority, and the financial aspect becomes secondary, especially since the service was not provided as agreed and caused harm.\n\nIn legal terms, if a service provider fails to adhere to agreed terms and causes harm, the client might not be liable for the full payment. However, this can vary, and it's possible the Domme could pursue legal action, though the user might have a defense based on breach of contract and negligence.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay after the Domme ignored their safe word and caused harm. The Domme's actions were the primary issue here.\n"
