I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. \n\nFirst, the context: The user set up a session with a domme, paid a $50 deposit, discussed limits (medium max intensity), and established a safe word (dropping a ball). However, during the session, the domme exceeded the agreed intensity, the user dropped the safe word (the ball), but she continued, leading to severe pain and injury. The user left without paying the remaining $300 and is now being criticized by a friend who's also a domme.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **Agreed Limits and Safe Words**: The user clearly communicated their limits and the safe word. The domme ignored these, which is a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. In kink communities, respecting safe words is fundamental. Ignoring them can lead to serious harm and is considered a violation of boundaries.\n\n2. **Injury and Safety**: The user suffered physical injury (enlarged testicles, pain, almost passing out). The domme's actions went beyond what was agreed, leading to a medical emergency. The user's decision to seek medical help is justified.\n\n3. **Financial Responsibility**: The domme is now demanding payment for the session. However, since she violated the agreed terms and caused harm, the user's refusal to pay could be seen as justified. The user was the victim here, not the aggressor. The broken restraints were a result of the user's distress, which the domme contributed to by ignoring the safe word.\n\n4. **Community Criticism**: The friend's criticism that the user is an \"asshole\" for not paying is likely based on the assumption that payment is obligatory regardless of the domme's actions. However, this overlooks the domme's breach of agreement and the user's right to safety. The domme's threat to badmouth the user is also problematic and reflects poor conduct.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Legally, if the domme provided a service that was negligent and caused harm, the user might not be obligated to pay for it. Ethically, the domme's failure to adhere to safety protocols and the user's right to withdraw consent (via the safe word) places the blame on the domme.\n\nIn conclusion, the user is not in the wrong. The domme's actions were the primary issue, and the user's refusal to pay is a reasonable response given the circumstances. The user prioritized their health and safety, which should take precedence over financial obligations in this case.\n"
