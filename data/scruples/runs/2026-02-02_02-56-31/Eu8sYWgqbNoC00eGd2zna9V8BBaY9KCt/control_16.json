I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid domme session where the author didn't pay after the session because the domme ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, the safe word is crucial in BDSM. It's a safety measure to stop the activity immediately. The author set up a clear safe word: dropping a ball. When they dropped it, expecting immediate stop, the domme didn't stop, leading to severe pain. The author then broke free, there was a broken restraint, and the domme demanded payment. The author refused to pay, citing the safe word was ignored, and the domme threatened to blackball them.\n\nThe friend, who is also a domme, says the author is in the wrong for not paying, arguing that pushing limits is part of the role. But the key here is whether the domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocols. If the safe word was not respected, that's a major breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service was not delivered as agreed, and there was potential harm caused. However, the domme might argue that the session was completed, hence payment is due.\n\nBut in professional settings, even if a service is provided, if it's done in a way that's unsafe or breaches the agreed terms, the client isn't obligated to pay. The author's health was at risk, and the domme didn't adhere to the safety measures they had discussed. The broken restraint might be due to the force used, which was beyond the agreed limits. The author's decision to leave and go to the hospital is a reasonable response to a dangerous situation.\n\nThe domme's behavior of continuing after the safe word was triggered is a serious issue. The author's refusal to pay is a response to a potentially harmful situation and broken agreement. The threat to blacklist the author might be an overreaction, but the core issue is the violation of the safe word. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying given the domme's failure to follow the agreed safety protocols.\n"
