I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The situation involves a ballbusting session that went beyond the agreed limits, leading to injury and the user not paying the remaining amount.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The user set up a session with clear parameters: medium power max, a specific safe word (dropping a ball), and restraints and a ball gag. The Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, ignored the safe word, and continued causing pain even after the user dropped the ball. The user ended up needing medical attention and refused to pay the remaining $300. The Domme is now threatening to report the user for non-payment and broken equipment.\n\nThe user's friend, who's also a Domme, is advising them to pay, arguing that the Domme was just pushing their limits, and the user broke her straps, causing her financial loss. But the core issue is the violation of the safe word. In BDSM communities, safe words are crucial for communication and safety. Ignoring them is a serious breach of trust and can be dangerous.\n\nSo, the user's refusal to pay is because the Domme didn't respect their boundaries. The Domme's actions led to the user's injury and the need to go to the hospital. The fact that the user only paid a $50 deposit and the rest was due after the session might also play into it. If the service was agreed upon as $350 for 90 minutes, then the user not paying because the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms could be justified. The broken restraints were a result of the user's distress, not negligence or intentional damage. \n\nHowever, the user's friend is suggesting that the user is at fault, possibly because they didn't pay the full amount and broke the equipment. But the main ethical issue here is the Domme violating the safe word, which is a non-negotiable part of any consensual power exchange. The user's priority was safety and the Domme compromised that. The financial obligation might be secondary to the safety agreement. \n\nIn many service agreements, if the provider doesn't fulfill the agreed terms (in this case, respecting the safe word and not exceeding the agreed limits), the client isn't obligated to pay in full. The user's actions were a direct response to the Domme's failure to adhere to the session's boundaries. Also, the threat from the Domme to report the user for non-payment while also not respecting the safe word seems hypocritical. \n\nSo, considering the importance of safe words in consensual activities and the Domme's breach of that agreement, the user isn't in the wrong for withholding payment. The answer should be B (No).\n"
