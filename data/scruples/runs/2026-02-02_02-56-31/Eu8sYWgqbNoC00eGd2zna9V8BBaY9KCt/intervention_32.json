I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this situation. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. First, I need to understand the key points here. \n\nThe user set up a session with clear boundaries\u2014stating their limits for the intensity. They used a safe word system (holding a ball, dropping it to signal stop). The domme, however, went beyond the agreed limits, causing severe pain even after the user dropped the ball. The user then had to break the restraints to stop the activity, leading to an emergency hospital visit. The domme is now demanding payment and threatening to spread the word if they don't pay, while the user's friend (also a domme) says they should've paid regardless.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the violation of the agreed safe word and the domme exceeding the user's stated limits, which resulted in injury. In consensual kink activities, communication and respecting boundaries are paramount. The safe word is a critical part of that, ensuring that if someone is in pain beyond their limit, the activity stops immediately. The domme's failure to heed the safe word\u2014even if she believed she was within the user's limits\u2014constitutes a breach of trust and safety protocols. \n\nThe user's decision not to pay could be seen as withholding payment because the domme didn't follow the agreed terms. Since the service provided (ballbusting) was supposed to be within certain limits and the user was harmed because those limits were ignored, they might argue they didn't receive the service they paid for. On the other hand, the domme might claim she provided the service, albeit too intensely. However, the user's health and safety are more important. The domme's actions led to an injury, so the user might not be obligated to pay for a service that was delivered in a harmful manner. \n\nAdditionally, the domme's response of yelling and threatening the user when they were in pain is concerning. That shows a lack of empathy and responsibility. The user's friend might have a different perspective because she's part of the same community, but if the domme didn't respect the safe word, which is a standard practice, then the user isn't at fault. \n\nIn many service agreements, if the service isn't performed as contracted, the client isn't required to pay. Here, the contract was that the domme would stop upon the safe word being triggered. She didn't, leading to injury. The user's priority was their health, which is valid. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying under these circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
