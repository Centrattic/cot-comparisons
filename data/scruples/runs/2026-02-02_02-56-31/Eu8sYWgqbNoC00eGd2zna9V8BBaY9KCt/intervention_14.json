I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word. So, the situation is about a consensual role-play scenario where the user set a safe word (dropping a ball) to stop the activity if it gets too intense. The domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, continued causing pain, and then the user decided not to pay the remaining fee. The domme is upset and threatening to report them in the community.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of consent and boundaries. The user clearly communicated their limits (medium power max) and had a safe word in place. The domme, as a professional, should have respected those boundaries. When the user dropped the ball (safe word), the domme should have immediately stopped the activity. By continuing, she violated the agreed-upon terms, which could be a breach of trust and safety.\n\nThen, the aftermath: the user went to the hospital but was fine. The domme is now angry about not being paid and the broken equipment. The user's friend, who's also a domme, says they're an asshole for not paying. But in dom/sub relationships, especially in consensual power exchange, the dom's responsibility includes respecting the sub's limits and safety. If the dom didn't adhere to those, the sub has the right to reassess the relationship and their obligations.\n\nFinancial aspects: The user paid a deposit, but the main issue is the breach of trust and safety. The user didn't get the service they paid for because it wasn't delivered as agreed. They felt endangered, so not paying the remaining fee could be justified as the service wasn't properly provided. However, the deposit might be a point of contention. But if the domme violated the safe word, the user isn't obligated to pay the full amount because the terms weren't upheld.\n\nThe domme's reaction of threatening to report the user in the community is problematic. If the user had a legitimate issue, they have a right to not pay. The domme's actions (not respecting the safe word) are the root problem here. The user's friend might be biased, as she's a domme herself and perhaps has different expectations. But the primary issue is the violation of safety protocols, which is a serious matter in these communities.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The user isn't in the wrong because the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safe word, leading to harm and a breach of trust. The user's decision to not pay is justified as the service was not provided as contracted. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
