I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word. First, I need to understand the dynamics here. In consensual power exchange, safewords are crucial. They're there to ensure that the sub can communicate their limits and stop the activity if they exceed their pain tolerance. The user set up a safe word system using a ball in their hand, which the domme agreed to.\n\nThe domme, however, continued after the safe word was triggered. That's a big red flag. Even if the domme was experienced, ignoring a safeword is a violation of the agreed-upon boundaries. The user's safety and well-being should be the top priority. The fact that the domme kept up the activity despite the user dropping the ball (safe word) is a breach of trust and safety protocols. \n\nNext, the user didn't pay the full amount, which the domme argues is necessary. But the agreement was that the user would pay $350 for the session. The domme didn't ask for payment upfront, which is a bit unusual, but the user had already given a $50 deposit. After the session, the domme demands the remaining $300, but the user is in significant pain and has to go to the hospital. The user's friend, another domme, suggests that the user should still pay, arguing that the domme was just pushing limits. But that's a dangerous perspective. A responsible domme should respect the safe word and not push past the agreed limits, regardless of their experience. \n\nThere's also the issue of the broken restraints. The user broke them while thrashing in pain, which was a result of the domme's actions. The domme's reaction was to yell about the broken equipment, which shows she prioritized her property over the user's well-being. \n\nIn terms of financial responsibility, if the user had agreed to pay regardless of circumstances, that's one thing. But the session was not completed as agreed because the domme violated the safe word. The user had a legitimate reason to terminate the session and seek medical attention. The domme's threat to report the user for non-payment is also concerning, as it's a form of coercion. \n\nThe user's friend's reaction might be based on the idea that in some D/s dynamics, a domme might push limits, but that's not universally accepted and can be risky. The safety of the sub should never be compromised. The user's refusal to pay is a consequence of the domme's failure to uphold her end of the agreement. \n\nIn summary, the user is not in the wrong because the domme ignored the safe word, causing harm, and then expected payment despite not providing the agreed service. The user's health and safety should come first.\n"
