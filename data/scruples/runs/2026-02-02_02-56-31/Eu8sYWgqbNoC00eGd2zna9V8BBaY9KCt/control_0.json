I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dominatrix (Domme) who was supposed to follow agreed-upon limits and a safe word. The key points here are the consent and the breach of agreed terms.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with clear limits: medium power ballbusting max. The Domme didn't adhere to this. The safe word was dropping a ball, which the author did, but the Domme continued the punishment. That's a major red flag. The safe word is supposed to stop the session immediately, so the Domme's continued actions after the safe word was triggered is a violation of consent. \n\nThen there's the part where the author didn't pay the remaining $300. The Domme had asked for a $50 deposit upfront, but the rest was to be paid after the session. However, since the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon terms and caused harm, the author's decision not to pay could be justified. The friend, who is also a domme, argues that the author should pay because the Domme was just pushing limits, but that's a bit conflicting. If the Domme breached the agreed terms, the author is not obligated to pay. \n\nAlso, the author was injured and went to the hospital, which is a serious consequence. The Domme's reaction was to yell and threaten the community, which seems more about her losing money than the client's well-being. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, if someone breaches a contract (in this case, the agreed terms of the session), the other party isn't obligated to fulfill their part of the contract. The author's safety and health are more important than paying for a service that was not provided as agreed and caused harm. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme violated the terms they both agreed on. The answer should be B.\n"
