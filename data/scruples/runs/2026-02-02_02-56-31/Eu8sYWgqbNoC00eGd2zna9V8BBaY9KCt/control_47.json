I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying the domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person set up a session with a domme, paid a $50 deposit out of $350 total. They agreed on a safe word system using a ball. When the session started, the domme went beyond the agreed limits, causing severe pain. The person dropped the ball (their safe word signal) but the domme continued for three more kicks. This led to injury and the person had to go to the hospital. They refused to pay the remaining $300, and the domme is threatening to report them.\n\nThe key points here are the use of the safe word and the domme's actions. In BDSM, safe words are crucial for consent and safety. The domme's responsibility is to respect the sub's limits and stop immediately when the safe word is given. By continuing after the safe word was triggered, the domme breached the agreed terms and potentially caused harm. \n\nThe person didn't pay the full amount, but they had only paid a deposit. Since the domme didn't fulfill the agreed session properly and caused harm, the person might not be obligated to pay the rest. However, the domme argues that the person broke her equipment and should still pay. But if the session was not conducted as agreed and the domme was negligent, the person's refusal to pay could be justified. \n\nAlso, the domme's actions led to an injury, which could be a legal issue. The person going to the hospital shows that the situation was serious. The domme's response of threatening the community might be an overreaction. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the domme failed in her duty to stop upon the safe word. The person's choice to not pay because the service was not delivered properly and caused harm seems reasonable. The friend's opinion is that the person is an asshole, but that might be from a domme's perspective prioritizing payment over safety. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocols, leading to injury, and the person is not obligated to pay for a service that was not properly provided and caused harm.\n"
