I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. The scenario involves a painful experience where the safe word wasn't respected, leading to injury and a decision not to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The user set up a session with clear limits and a safe word system. The safe word was dropping a ball, which the Domme ignored, continuing past the agreed medium intensity. This led to significant pain and potential injury. The user didn't pay the remaining amount, and the Domme is threatening to report them to the community. The user's friend, who's a Domme, is advising them to pay regardless, but that seems conflicting given the situation.\n\nIn BDSM contexts, consent and safety are paramount. The safe word is a crucial part of any agreement. If the Domme disregarded the safe word, that's a major violation. Even if there's a contract or payment terms, the user's safety should come first. The Domme's actions could be considered negligent or even abusive, especially if it caused physical harm. The user not paying because the agreed terms were violated makes sense. The Domme could be responsible for the equipment damage since it happened during her session, and the user's injury might be her liability. \n\nHowever, the user's friend argues that pushing limits is part of the role, but pushing beyond agreed limits and ignoring the safe word crosses into harmful behavior. The user's decision to seek medical help and not pay could be justified as self-preservation. The friend's advice might be biased, as some in the community might prioritize payment over safety. \n\nLegally, if there was a contract, non-payment could be an issue, but if the service was not delivered properly (i.e., violating agreed terms), it might not hold up. Ethically, the Domme's actions were wrong, so the user isn't at fault. The user's right to their safety and health is more important than the payment. The answer is B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
