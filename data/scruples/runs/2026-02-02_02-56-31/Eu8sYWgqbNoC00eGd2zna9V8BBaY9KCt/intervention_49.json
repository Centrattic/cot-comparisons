I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. \n\nFirst, the setup: they paid a deposit, set clear limits, and agreed on a safe word (dropping a ball). The Domme allegedly ignored the safe word and went beyond the agreed intensity. The user ended up injured and refused to pay the remaining amount. The Domme is now threatening to spread negative information.\n\nThe user's friend, who is a domme, says they're an asshole for not paying. The friend's argument is that the Domme pushed their limits, which is part of the role, and that they should pay despite the breach of agreed terms. But that seems conflicting with standard consent and safety practices. \n\nIn consensual power exchange, especially in BDSM, communication and respect for boundaries are crucial. Safe words are there to be respected. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a clear violation of the agreed terms. The user's action of not paying could be justified as the service provided was unsafe and breached the initial agreement. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the user still received part of the service, hence the obligation to pay. But if the service was not delivered as per the contract (i.e., violating safety protocols), then the user might have grounds to withhold payment. Additionally, the user's injury and subsequent hospital visit add weight to their position, as the Domme's actions caused harm.\n\nThe user's friend's perspective is interesting because as a domme, she might prioritize payment over the violation, but that could indicate a different approach or misunderstanding of safety protocols. However, in ethical terms, respecting a safe word is non-negotiable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user is not in the wrong. The Domme failed to adhere to the agreed-upon boundaries, which caused harm. The user's decision to not pay because of this breach is justified.\n"
