I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is at fault for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, the setup: the person paid a deposit and agreed on a session with specific limits and a safe word. The safe word was dropping a ball, which would mean stopping immediately. However, during the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, causing severe pain. The user dropped the ball (their safe word signal), but she continued, leading to injury. They refused to pay due to her ignoring the safeword and causing harm.\n\nNow, ethical considerations. The Domme provided a service, but she violated the agreed-upon limits and safety protocols. The user didn't pay because the service was harmful and didn't meet the agreed terms. The Domme is now threatening the user for non-payment and reputational damage.\n\nLegal perspective: The contract here is verbal, but in many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be binding. However, if the service was not delivered as agreed (due to negligence or breach of contract), the user might have grounds to withhold payment. The injury adds a tortious aspect; the Domme could potentially be negligent if she ignored the safe word, causing harm. The user might have a claim for personal injury resulting from her failure to follow the agreed terms.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the user is an asshole because the Domme pushed limits is a common dom/sub dynamic perspective where pushing limits is part of the play. However, the user clearly stated their max, and the Domme exceeded it, leading to injury. Pushing limits is one thing, but causing actual harm and ignoring safety signals is another.\n\nThe user's refusal to pay could be seen as justified if the service was not properly provided, especially considering the harm caused. The Domme's equipment damage might be a separate issue, but if it's because the user was injured while restrained, the responsibility lies with the Domme for not adhering to the agreed terms.\n\nIn conclusion, the user is not in the wrong because the Domme breached their agreement by ignoring the safe word and causing injury, thus justifying the refusal to pay. The answer should be B.\n"
