I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, the setup: The individual arranged a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit out of $350 total. They discussed their limits for ballbusting, which is a painful activity. They agreed on a safe word system using a ball in their hand. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed-upon medium power, causing significant pain. When the sub dropped the ball (the safe word signal), the Domme didn't stop, continued for more kicks, and then blamed the sub for breaking the restraints. The sub then left without paying the remaining $300 and went to the hospital. The Domme is threatening to spread negative information about the sub not paying.\n\nThe key points here are the violation of the safe word and the Domme's responsibility. Safe words are critical in consensual power exchange dynamics. They're meant to ensure that the sub can stop the session immediately if they exceed their limits. The Domme's failure to respect the safe word is a major breach of trust and safety protocols. Even in BDSM, there's an expectation that the Dom will follow agreed-upon boundaries and stop when a safe word is given. \n\nThe Domme's actions led to the sub suffering physical harm, which is a serious issue. The sub's decision not to pay could be seen as a form of self-defense or protection, especially since the Domme didn't adhere to the terms set beforehand. However, the financial aspect is tricky. Contracts in such services are usually binding even if something goes wrong, but this is a personal agreement, not a legal one. The sub might have legal grounds if there was harm, but the question is about moral or social wrong.\n\nThe friend's argument is that the Domme pushed limits, which is part of the role, but pushing beyond the agreed-upon limits and ignoring the safe word goes beyond standard practice. Breaking the restraints was a result of the sub's distress, not their fault. The Domme's blame on the sub for that seems misplaced. \n\nSo, considering all that, the Domme is at fault for not respecting the safe word and causing harm. The sub's refusal to pay is a response to a breach of agreement and safety, so the sub isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
