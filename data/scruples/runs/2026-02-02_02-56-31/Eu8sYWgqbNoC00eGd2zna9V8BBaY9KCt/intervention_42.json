I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after not paying a Domme because she ignored their safe word during a session. The scenario involves a painful experience where the Domme continued after the safe word was triggered. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the use of a safe word and the Domme's actions. The user set clear limits and agreed on a safe word. When the safe word was triggered, the Domme didn't stop, leading to injury. The user then refused to pay, and the Domme is threatening the community.\n\nIn consensual BDSM, communication and respect for limits are crucial. The safe word is a non-negotiable stop signal. If the Domme ignored it, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The user's decision to not pay could be justified because the Domme violated the agreed terms, leading to harm. However, the user had already paid a deposit, and the Domme expects the remaining payment. But since the session wasn't completed properly and caused injury, the user might not be obligated to pay the full amount. \n\nThe friend's opinion that the user is an asshole is likely because the Domme provided the service, but the user's safety was compromised. However, the primary responsibility lies with the Domme to follow the safe word. The user's priority was medical care, which is understandable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the Domme's actions were the issue, and the user had the right to prioritize their safety and not pay for a service that was not conducted as agreed.\n"
