I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. So, the user asked, \"AITA for not paying a Domme after she ignored my safe word?\" Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the setup: The individual had a paid session with a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) for 90 minutes at $350. They gave a $50 deposit, discussed their limits for ballbusting, and set up a safe word system using a ball in their hand. The safe word protocol was that dropping the ball would mean the Domme should stop immediately. However, during the session, the Domme continued past the agreed-upon medium power, even after the user dropped the ball (the safe word). They received three more powerful kicks, leading to severe pain and injury, which required a hospital visit. The Domme then demanded the remaining $300, and when the user refused because she violated the safe word, she threatened to spread negative information about them in the Domme community. The user's friend, who is also a Domme, suggests the user is at fault for not paying and for breaking the equipment, implying that the Domme pushed their limits as part of the role.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Consent and Safe Words**: In BDSM practices, mutual consent and agreed-upon safe words are foundational. The Domme's responsibility is to respect the sub's limits and stop immediately upon the safe word being triggered. Ignoring the safe word is a serious breach of trust and safety.\n\n2. **Injury and Safety Violation**: The Domme caused significant pain and injury, leading to a hospital visit. This indicates a failure to adhere to safety protocols, which is a critical issue in any consensual power exchange.\n\n3. **Payment and Contractual Obligations**: The user agreed to pay for the session, but the Domme failed to deliver the agreed-upon service (i.e., respecting limits and ensuring safety). The user's refusal to pay could be seen as a response to a breach of contract.\n\n4. **Threats and Harassment**: The Domme's reaction included threatening to spread information about the user not paying, which is a form of harassment or intimidation. This adds another layer of wrongdoing from the Domme's side.\n\n5. **Friend's Perspective**: The user's friend, a Domme, suggests the user is at fault. However, the friend's perspective might be influenced by the community's expectations, possibly overlooking the importance of the safe word violation and the injury caused.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if a service is paid for, there's a contractual obligation. However, if the service delivered is not as agreed (e.g., violating agreed-upon terms and causing harm), the client might not be obligated to pay the full amount. Ethically, the user is justified in withholding payment because the Domme failed to follow the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm. The safe word was a critical part of the agreement, and ignoring it is a breach of trust and safety.\n\nThe user's refusal to pay in this case is a response to a serious violation of their agreed terms. The Domme's actions were not just about exceeding limits but ignoring a clear safe word, leading to injury. The user's friend's argument might be based on the idea that Dommes should push limits, but in a consensual scenario, the safe word should never be ignored. Pushing limits isn't justified if it's done recklessly and without respecting the agreed-upon boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the user is not in the wrong for not paying because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word, caused harm, and the service delivered was not as contracted. The threats from the Domme further indicate her wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
