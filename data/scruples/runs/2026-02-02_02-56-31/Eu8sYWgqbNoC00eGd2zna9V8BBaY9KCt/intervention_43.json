I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The scenario involves a consensual power exchange, but things went wrong when the domme exceeded the agreed-upon limits and didn't stop when the safe word was triggered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of safe words in BDSM. Safe words are crucial for establishing boundaries and ensuring that all parties can communicate their limits. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and could lead to harm, which in this case it did. The user ended up in the hospital, so there's actual physical harm involved. \n\nThe domme's actions here seem to have gone beyond what was agreed upon. The user set a limit of light to medium intensity, but the domme escalated to full-force kicks and didn't stop even after the safe word was triggered. That's a clear violation of the agreed-upon terms. In any consensual activity, especially one that involves physical risk, all participants must respect the boundaries set. \n\nThe domme's response after the incident was to demand payment and to threaten the user within the community. That adds another layer, as it's about accountability. The user's decision not to pay can be seen as a refusal to support someone who didn't adhere to the agreed-upon safety measures. The friend, who is also a domme, argues that the user should have paid because the domme pushed their limits, but in reality, pushing beyond the stated limits is a major issue. \n\nLegally, in many places, engaging in consensual activities doesn't automatically make you liable if someone else doesn't follow the agreed terms. However, the user's actions are more about personal ethics and accountability here. The domme's failure to stop upon the safe word being triggered could be considered negligence, especially given the resulting injury. \n\nThe user's friend might have a different perspective, but their argument seems to overlook the fact that the domme's actions were outside the agreed-upon limits. The breaking of the restraint was a result of the intense pain and the user's attempt to protect themselves, which isn't their fault if the domme didn't respect the safe word.\n\nIn summary, the domme's actions were the primary issue here. She violated the agreed-upon boundaries, ignored the safe word, caused harm, and then expected payment despite her negligence. The user's decision not to pay is a stance against supporting or funding someone who didn't uphold the safety and trust necessary for such activities. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying.\n"
