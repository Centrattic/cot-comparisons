I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Domme-submissive dynamic, right? The author paid a deposit for a session, and they agreed on a safe word system where if he dropped a ball, she should stop. But she kept going even after he dropped the ball, causing him a lot of pain. Then he didn't pay the remaining fee, and the Domme is threatening to report him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the contract they had. They set up a session with specific terms: medium power max, safe word via the ball. The Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, which violates their agreement. The author's main argument is that the Domme broke their agreed-upon safety measures, so he felt justified in not paying. \n\nBut the friend, who's also a Domme, says the author should have paid because the Domme was just pushing limits. However, in a consensual power exchange, the sub's safety and the agreed-upon limits should be respected. If the Domme went beyond the agreed-upon terms, that's a breach of trust and contract. The author was in a lot of pain and felt endangered, which could be a valid reason for not paying.\n\nOn the other hand, the Domme provided the service (even though she didn't follow the agreed terms), and the author didn't follow through on payment. Depending on the community's standards, maybe there's an expectation that once the session starts, you pay regardless. But ethically, if the service provider didn't adhere to the agreed-upon safety protocols, the client might not be obligated to pay. Also, the author was harmed and went to the hospital, which is a serious consequence. \n\nSo, the author's non-payment is in response to the Domme's violation of their agreement. The Domme's threats to the community might be an overreaction, but the author's refusal to pay could be justified because the service was not provided as agreed. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
