I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Domme session where the user didn't pay after the Domme ignored their safe word. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The user set up a session with a Domme, agreed on limits (medium power max for ballbusting), and established a safe word (dropping a ball). During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, caused significant pain, ignored the safe word (the user dropped the ball), continued for three more kicks, and then the user ended up in the hospital. The user didn't pay the remaining $300 and the Domme is threatening to blackball them in the community.\n\nNow, considering the principles of consensual power exchange in BDSM, safety, and communication are paramount. The safe word system is a fundamental part of any BDSM activity to ensure that the sub can stop the session immediately if they're in too much pain or discomfort. The Domme's role is to respect the sub's limits and boundaries. Here, the Domme not only ignored the safe word but also exceeded the agreed-upon intensity, leading to physical harm that required medical attention. That's a serious breach of trust and safety protocols.\n\nThe Domme's actions could be considered negligent or even abusive, especially since the user ended up in the hospital. The fact that the user didn't pay the remaining amount seems justified because the service provided was harmful and violated the agreed terms. The Domme's claim about the broken equipment and expecting payment despite her negligence is also questionable. If the user breaking free was a direct result of the Domme ignoring the safe word, then the equipment damage could be her responsibility, not the user's.\n\nThe friend who's a domme says the user is an asshole for not paying, but that might be from a perspective that values payment regardless of the circumstances. However, in a consensual and safe environment, the priority is the well-being of the sub. If the Domme failed in her duty to protect the user's safety, the user isn't obligated to pay for a service that was harmful and not as agreed.\n\nLegal considerations might also come into play. If the user can prove that the Domme ignored safety protocols leading to injury, there could be grounds for not paying, especially if there's any form of contract or agreement that was breached. Additionally, the threat to inform the community about non-payment could be seen as harassment or intimidation, which is another issue.\n\nIn summary, the Domme's actions were a clear violation of the agreed terms and safety protocols, leading to physical harm. The user's decision to not pay and seek medical attention is a reasonable response to protect their health and well-being. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
