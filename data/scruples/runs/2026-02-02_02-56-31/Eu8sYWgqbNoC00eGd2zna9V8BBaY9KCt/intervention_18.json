I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after not paying a Domme who ignored their safe word during a session. The situation involves a power exchange dynamic, which typically has specific protocols to ensure safety and consent.\n\nFirst, the user set clear limits: medium power for ballbusting. The Domme, however, escalated beyond that, delivering hard kicks and a boot to the groin despite the user's stated limits. The safe word system was using a ball; dropping it meant stopping immediately. But when the user dropped the ball, the Domme didn't stop, leading to severe pain and injury. \n\nThe user then didn't pay the remaining $300, citing the Domme's failure to adhere to the agreed-upon boundaries and their own injury. The Domme is now threatening to report the user for non-payment and equipment damage. A friend, who's also a domme, is saying the user is an asshole for not paying, arguing that pushing limits is part of the role and that the user should cover the costs.\n\nFrom a consent and safety perspective, the Domme violated the agreed terms. Safe words are non-negotiable in such scenarios. Ignoring them is a breach of trust and safety, which can lead to harm. The user's decision not to pay could be justified as the service provided didn't meet the agreed-upon terms and caused harm. Additionally, the user's health and safety are paramount, and seeking medical attention was necessary.\n\nHowever, from a business standpoint, the Domme might argue that payment is due regardless of the outcome, especially if there was a prior agreement. But if the terms of the session were breached by the Domme, the user isn't obligated to pay. The damage to the equipment was a result of the Domme's actions exceeding the user's limits, so holding the user responsible for that might not be fair.\n\nConsidering all aspects, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme failed to uphold the agreed-upon boundaries, leading to harm. The priority in such activities should always be safety and consent, which were compromised here.\n"
