I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme and a submissive who paid a deposit but didn't pay the full amount after the Domme allegedly ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The submissive set up a session with a safe word protocol using a ball. He agreed to a medium power level, but the Domme went beyond that, causing extreme pain. When he dropped the ball as the safe word, she didn't stop and continued, leading to injury. He then refused to pay the remaining $300 because she didn't follow the agreed-upon safety measures and caused harm. The Domme is threatening to report him to the community for not paying and damaging her equipment.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The safe word is a fundamental part of consensual power exchange. If the Domme ignored the safe word, which the submissive used, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The submissive's health was compromised, and he went to the hospital. The financial obligation is tricky. Usually, in such services, payment is expected regardless of the session's outcome, but in this case, the service was harmful. The submissive has a right to refuse payment if the service was not provided as agreed upon and caused harm. \n\nThe friend, who's also a domme, says he's an asshole for not paying. That's an interesting angle. In that community, there might be unspoken rules about payment, but if the provider breached the agreed terms and caused harm, the client isn't obligated to pay. Also, the damage to the straps is the Domme's responsibility if her actions led to their breaking. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The Domme didn't respect the safe word, which is a critical part of consent. The submissive's safety was compromised. Refusing to pay under those circumstances is understandable. The Domme's threats to report him for non-payment might be a power tactic, but the client's health and rights take precedence. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
