I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. The situation involves a ballbusting session where they had agreed on medium power max. The Domme didn't stop when they dropped the safe word ball, continued kicking, causing significant pain and injury. They ended up in the hospital, and now the Domme is upset because they didn't pay and broke her equipment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The safe word system is crucial in BDSM for safety. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. The user was in pain, felt like something was wrong, and went to the hospital. The Domme's actions led to injury, so she might be responsible for that. The user didn't pay because the service was unsafe and potentially harmful. The friend, who's a Domme, says the user is in the wrong for not paying and breaking the equipment. But does that matter if the Domme didn't follow agreed-upon limits?\n\nIn terms of ethics and responsibility, the Domme has a duty to ensure the sub's safety. If she violated the safe word, which is a basic safety measure, then she's at fault. The user has the right to not pay for a service that was delivered in a dangerous manner. Also, the broken restraints might be due to the user's distress, which the Domme could have anticipated by not respecting the safe word. The friend's opinion might be biased, especially if they're part of the same community, maybe expecting payment regardless of misconduct. \n\nBut some might argue that the user should have paid for the session because the Domme did provide the service, even if it was beyond the agreed intensity. However, the safe word is supposed to be a non-negotiable stop. Ignoring it is a major violation. The user's health and safety are more important than the payment. Also, the financial loss from the broken equipment should be the Domme's responsibility if she didn't follow the safety rules. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong because the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed-upon safety limits, leading to injury. They have the right to refuse payment in such a case. The answer should be B (No).\n"
