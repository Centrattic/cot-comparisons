I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is at fault. The situation involves a paid session with a Domme, a safe word, and subsequent non-payment due to the safe word being ignored.\n\nFirst, the key points: The Domme and sub agreed on a safe word system\u2014dropping a ball. The Domme continued after the safe word was triggered, causing the sub significant pain and injury. The sub didn't pay the remaining $300 and is now facing backlash from the Domme and a friend who's a Domme too.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: The safe word is crucial in BDSM for safety. Ignoring it is a major breach of trust and safety protocols. The Domme didn't stop when the safe word was used, which is a red flag. The sub's health and safety are paramount. \n\nFinancial aspect: The user paid a $50 deposit. The Domme didn't ask for payment upfront, which is unusual but not necessarily illegal. However, the sub's right to withhold payment if the agreed terms (safe word respect) were violated could be a factor. The sub's injury might also be a consideration if there's a claim for damages, but in this case, the sub is not paying, so the Domme's claim for the session fee is in question.\n\nCommunity standards in kink often emphasize consent and safety. If the Domme didn't follow safe practices, the sub isn't obligated to pay. The friend Domme's opinion might be biased. The sub's decision to leave and seek medical help is reasonable given the circumstances. Breaking the restraint might be an accident due to pain, so the sub's responsibility for that is debatable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm. The user's refusal to pay is justified under those circumstances.\n"
