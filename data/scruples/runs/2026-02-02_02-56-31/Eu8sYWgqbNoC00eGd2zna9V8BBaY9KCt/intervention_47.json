I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they paid a domme for a session, but the domme ignored their safe word, leading to injury. They didn't pay the remaining amount and the domme is threatening to report them.\n\nFirst, the user set up a session with clear limits: medium power max. They had a safe word system using a ball. When the domme went beyond the agreed limits and the user dropped the ball (the safe word), the domme didn't stop. Instead, she kept kicking, leading to the user getting hurt. The domme then asked for the remaining payment and threatened to report the user for not paying and for breaking the restraints.\n\nThe user's friend, who's a domme, says the user is in the wrong because the domme pushed their limits, which is part of the job, and they should have paid despite the incident. But this seems conflicting because the user was injured and the domme violated the agreed safe word.\n\nIn a consensual power exchange, safety is paramount. Safe words are there to be respected. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a major breach of trust and safety. The user had the right to stop the session because they were in pain beyond their limits. The domme shouldn't have continued after the safe word was triggered. Also, the user was injured, so not paying the remaining amount might be justified because the service wasn't delivered as agreed. The domme's equipment breaking might be a separate issue, but the main problem is the violation of safety protocols. The user acting in self-preservation and seeking medical help is understandable. The friend's argument that the user is in the wrong doesn't account for the domme's failure to follow the agreed-upon safe word. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for withholding payment after the domme caused harm by ignoring the safe word.\n"
