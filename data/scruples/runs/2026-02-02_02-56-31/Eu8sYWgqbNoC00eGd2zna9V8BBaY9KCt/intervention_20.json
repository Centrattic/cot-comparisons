I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a dominatrix session where the person didn't pay after the domme ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, the user set up the session with a domme, paid a $50 deposit, and discussed their limits for ballbusting, specifying medium max. They agreed on a safe word system involving holding a ball, and if they dropped it, the domme should stop. But during the session, the domme went beyond what was agreed, causing significant pain. The user dropped the ball (safe word) but the domme continued, leading to injury. The user then didn't pay the remaining $300, and the domme is threatening to spread negative information.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, safety, and the terms of the service. The user had clearly stated their limits, and the domme ignored the safe word, which is a fundamental part of any power exchange or BDSM activity. The safe word is there to ensure the sub's safety, and the dom's responsibility is to respect that. By continuing after the safe word was triggered, the domme breached the agreed-upon boundaries, which could be considered negligence or even assault.\n\nThe user not paying could be seen as justified because the service didn't adhere to the agreed terms and caused harm. The domme's claim about losing money from broken equipment might be a factor, but if the equipment was broken due to her actions (excessive force leading to thrashing), that's on her. Also, threatening to blackball the user for not paying might be an overreach, especially if the service was not properly provided.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the user is an asshole is probably because she's within the domme community and might prioritize payment and equipment over the safety breach. However, in this scenario, the domme failed to uphold her end of the agreement by ignoring the safe word, which is a major violation. The user's priority was their health and safety, which is more important than paying for a service that was mishandled.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong because the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm. The user's decision to not pay and seek medical help was reasonable under the circumstances.\n"
