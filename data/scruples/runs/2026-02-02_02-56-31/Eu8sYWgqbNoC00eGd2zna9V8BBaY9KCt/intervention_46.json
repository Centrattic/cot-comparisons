I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the user paid a deposit, set up a session with clear limits. They agreed on a safe word (dropping a ball), but when they dropped it, the domme didn't stop and kept kicking. The user ended up in pain, had to go to the hospital, and refused to pay the remaining fee. Now, the friend says they're an asshole for not paying.\n\nHmm. In consensual power exchange, trust and safety are key. The user communicated their limits clearly. The safe word is supposed to be an immediate stop. If the domme ignored that, she's not respecting the agreement, which is a big no-no. The user's safety is paramount. By continuing after the safe word, the domme breached trust and caused harm. So, the user not paying because of that seems justified. They were harmed beyond their limits, and the domme didn't uphold her end. The friend's argument that the user should pay because the domme was just pushing limits is flawed because the safe word was there for a reason. Also, the user was injured, so not paying as a response makes sense. But maybe there's a nuance about the deposit. The user paid $50 upfront. Should they have to return that? Or keep it as compensation for the damages? Also, breaking the restraints\u2014was that the user's fault or the domme's? If the pain was so intense they broke free, that's the domme's responsibility. The domme's yelling about the equipment is unprofessional. So overall, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
