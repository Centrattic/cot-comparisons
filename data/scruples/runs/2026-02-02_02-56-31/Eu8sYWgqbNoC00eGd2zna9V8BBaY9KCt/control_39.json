I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a paid domme session where the author didn't pay after the domme ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the safe word being ignored and the physical harm that resulted. The author had a pre-agreed safe word system where dropping the ball meant to stop immediately. The domme continued beyond the safe word, causing severe pain and leading to an injury that required a hospital visit. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the domme broke the agreed-upon safety rules, that's a serious issue. The safe word is meant to ensure the sub's safety, so ignoring it could be considered a breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay because the domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms might be justified if the safe word wasn't followed properly. However, the domme's perspective is that she was pushing the author's limits, and maybe the author broke the restraints, causing damage.\n\nBut the main argument here is about the safe word. If the domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, that's a major violation. The author had the right to expect their limits to be respected, especially since they communicated them clearly. The fact that they ended up in the hospital shows the potential danger. The domme's response of yelling and threatening the author instead of prioritizing their well-being further indicates a lack of professionalism.\n\nThe friend, who's also a domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying, but that might be from a domme community's standpoint where payment is expected regardless of the session's outcome. However, the author's safety was compromised, which is a higher priority. Legally and ethically, the domme had a duty of care, and failing that could mean the author isn't obligated to pay. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocols, leading to harm, which justifies the author's decision not to pay.\n"
