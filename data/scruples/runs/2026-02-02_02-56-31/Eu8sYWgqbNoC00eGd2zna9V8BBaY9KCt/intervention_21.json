I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The situation involves a consensual power exchange scenario where the client set clear limits. The Domme agreed to those limits but then exceeded them, causing significant pain. The user used the agreed-upon safe word (dropping the ball) but she didn't stop, leading to injury. They left without paying and got a friend's Domme to call, who says they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of consensual play. The user provided a deposit and discussed their limits, including the safe word. The Domme didn't honor the safe word, which is a fundamental part of any consensual power dynamic. Safe words are meant to be respected to ensure the sub's well-being. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a breach of agreement.\n\nThen, the user didn't pay the remaining $300, which the Domme claims is due to the broken restraints. But the main issue is the violation of the safe word. The user was in pain and had to go to the hospital. The Domme's reaction of yelling and threatening to report them for non-payment seems inappropriate, especially after causing harm. The user's priority was their health, so it's reasonable they didn't pay. \n\nHowever, there's a mention of the user's friend, a Domme, calling them an asshole for not paying. This might be because in some community standards, payment is expected regardless of the session's outcome, especially if there's an agreement. But the key here is that the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon protocols. If the terms of the session included stopping on the safe word, then the user isn't at fault for withholding payment when the terms were violated. \n\nAlso, the user broke the restraints in self-defense, which the Domme is now charging for. But if the restraints were part of the agreed equipment, and the user was forced into a situation where they had to break them to avoid harm, the responsibility might lie with the Domme for not respecting the safe word. The user might not be obligated to pay for damages they were forced to cause in an emergency. \n\nSo, considering all points: the Domme violated the safe word, caused injury, and acted hostile. The user prioritized their health and safety, which is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
