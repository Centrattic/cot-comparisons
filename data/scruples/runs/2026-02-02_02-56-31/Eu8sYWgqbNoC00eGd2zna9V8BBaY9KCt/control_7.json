I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, the setup: The user paid a deposit, agreed on boundaries, and set a safe word. The Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, causing injury. The user didn't pay the remaining fee and is being criticized by a friend who's also a Domme.\n\nKey points: The safe word was supposed to be a clear stop signal. The Domme continued after the user dropped the ball (safe word), leading to injury. The user's friend argues that the Domme was just pushing limits, but the main issue is the violation of agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nIn BDSM, the safe word is sacred. If a Domme ignores it, they're violating the trust and safety agreement. The user's right to their boundaries is paramount. The fact that the Domme continued after the safe word was triggered is a serious breach. The user's decision not to pay could be justified as the service wasn't provided safely as agreed. The broken restraint was a result of the Domme's actions, so expecting payment despite that seems unfair. \n\nThe friend's argument that the user should pay regardless is flawed. The user's health and safety take precedence over payment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
