I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, and they discussed limits for ballbusting. He established a safe word system using a ball\u2014holding it means okay, dropping it means stop. However, during the session, the Domme went beyond his stated limits, causing severe pain. When he dropped the ball (the safe word), she didn't stop and continued, leading to injury. He then refused to pay the remaining $300, leading to the Domme threatening to report him to the community.\n\nThe key points here are the use of a safe word and the Domme ignoring it, resulting in harm. The user's friend, another Domme, says he should have paid her because the Domme was just pushing his limits. But that seems to contradict standard safe word protocols in BDSM. Typically, a safe word is an immediate stop, and ignoring it is a serious violation. The Domme's actions could be seen as negligent or even abusive, especially since the user was injured.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is at fault for not paying after the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word. Legally and ethically, if the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms and caused harm, the user isn't obligated to pay. The user also has a right to prioritize their safety and health. The Domme's equipment breakage was a result of the user's injury, so maybe that's on the Domme for not respecting the safe word.\n\nThe friend's opinion might be biased, as she's a Domme too, possibly upholding a code that expects payment regardless. But the main issue is the violation of the safe word, which is a fundamental aspect of consensual power exchange. The user isn't in the wrong for not paying someone who caused harm by ignoring safety agreements.\n"
