I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The situation involves a consensual power exchange with specific limits set beforehand. The Domme agreed to a safe word system, but when the user dropped the ball (their safe word), she didn't stop. The user ended up injured and didn't pay, while the Domme is threatening to report them for non-payment.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and safety. The user had set a clear safe word and communicated their limits. When those limits were exceeded and the safe word was ignored, the user had the right to stop the session. The Domme's actions went beyond the agreed terms, which is a big red flag. Safety is paramount in any consensual activity, especially in activities involving pain or physical impact.\n\nThe user not paying makes sense because the contract (the agreed session with limits) wasn't honored. The Domme's refusal to stop after the safe word was triggered breaches the agreed-upon safety measures, which is a serious issue. The friend's argument that the user should pay because the Domme pushed their limits is flawed. Pushing limits doesn't absolve the Domme of respecting the safe word. The user's safety should have priority over payment.\n\nAlso, the user ended up needing medical attention, which reinforces that the Domme's actions were harmful. The user's decision to not pay is justified because the service provided was dangerous and didn't adhere to the agreed terms. The Domme's reaction of threatening to report the user is more about protecting her own interests than addressing the safety breach.\n\nSo, in this case, the user isn't in the wrong. The Domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocols, and the user acted in self-preservation. The payment isn't required when the terms of the session were not followed. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
