I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Domme session where the user didn't pay because the Domme ignored their safe word. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the user set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit out of $350 total. They established a safe word system using a ball in their hand. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed medium power, leading to the user dropping the ball (their safe word), but she didn't stop. The user ended up in a lot of pain, broke a restraint, and then left without paying the remaining $300. The Domme is threatening to report them to the community for not paying, and a friend (also a Domme) says the user should have paid despite the issues.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and safety. In any consensual power exchange, especially in BDSM, safe words are crucial. The user clearly communicated their limits (medium max), and the Domme exceeded that. The safe word was triggered (dropping the ball), and the Domme did not heed it, which is a major violation. The user's health and safety should be the top priority. The Domme's actions led to the user needing medical attention, which is serious.\n\nRegarding payment, in such services, payment is typically expected regardless of the session's outcome unless there was a breach of agreed terms. However, the Domme's failure to respect the safe word and cause harm could be considered a breach of trust and safety protocols. The user's decision not to pay might be seen as justified because the service was not provided as agreed, and there was harm caused. The broken restraint could be due to the user's distress, which the Domme might be responsible for if she didn't ensure safety.\n\nThe friend's perspective that the user should pay is conflicting, but in standard practice, if a provider doesn't adhere to agreed terms and causes harm, the client isn't obligated to pay. Also, the user's health took priority, which is non-negotiable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated their limits and safety, leading to medical issues. The user acted to protect their health, which is paramount.\n"
