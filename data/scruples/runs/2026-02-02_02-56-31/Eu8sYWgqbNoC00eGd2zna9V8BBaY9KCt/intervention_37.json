I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. The situation is pretty intense. They paid a deposit of $50 out of $350 total. They set up a safe word system with a ball in their hand. When they dropped the ball after she went beyond their agreed limits, she kept going. The user ended up in a lot of pain, broke a restraint, and when they refused to pay the remaining, the domme threatened to tell the community.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. In any consensual power exchange, especially in BDSM, communication and respecting boundaries are crucial. The safe word is a key element for safety. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. The user was in pain beyond their limits, which they had communicated beforehand. The domme's actions could be seen as reckless or even abusive if she didn't stop when the safe word was used.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The user paid a deposit but didn't pay the full amount because the service wasn't delivered as agreed. The domme is upset about the broken equipment and the non-payment. But the user's health and safety are more important. They went to the hospital, which suggests that the session had real physical consequences. \n\nThe friend (also a domme) said the user is an asshole for not paying. Maybe she's arguing that the user should follow through on the payment because the session was agreed upon, even if it went wrong. But in that case, the domme was negligent. If the domme didn't follow the agreed terms, the user isn't obligated to pay the remaining balance. Plus, the user's injury could be a legal issue if the domme was careless. \n\nHowever, the user did agree to the session and the terms, which might mean they're partially responsible for not stopping sooner or not communicating effectively. But the safe word was used, and the domme ignored it. That's a major point. The domme has a duty to respect the safe word. \n\nSo the main question is whether the domme's actions were in violation of the agreed-upon limits, and if so, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying. The deposit could be considered a good faith payment, but the rest is likely a breach of contract in terms of safety. The user's right to their safety and health should take precedence over the payment. The domme's threats about the community are maybe an attempt to pressure the user, which isn't justified if she was at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might not have effectively communicated their pain or checked in with the domme before escalating. But the safe word was their signal, and she ignored it. That's a clear violation. The user's decision to prioritize their health over the payment is understandable. So I think the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
