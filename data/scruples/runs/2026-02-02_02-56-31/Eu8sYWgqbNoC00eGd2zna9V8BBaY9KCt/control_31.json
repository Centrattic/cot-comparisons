I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault for not paying the domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person set up a session where they specified their limits for ballbusting, which is light to medium. The domme didn't ask for payment upfront but got a $50 deposit. They used a safe word system with a ball in their hand, and when they dropped it (which is supposed to mean stop), the domme kept going. The person got hurt, broke the restraints, and then went to the hospital. Now the domme is saying they should pay the remaining $300 and is threatening to tell others in the domme community if they don't. The friend, who's also a domme, says the user is in the wrong because the domme was just pushing limits and they should pay for damaging her equipment.\n\nSo, the main points here are the violation of the safe word, the domme causing pain beyond agreed limits, and the user not paying. The question is whether the user is at fault.\n\nIn BDSM contexts, safety is crucial. Safe words are supposed to be respected to prevent harm. If the domme ignored the safe word (the dropped ball), that's a serious breach of safety protocols. The user's priority is their health and safety. Even if the friend says the domme was doing her job, pushing limits without respecting the safe word could be dangerous. The user broke the restraints to protect themselves, which is a safety measure. The domme then accuses the user of damaging the equipment, but the user's action was a necessity to avoid further injury.\n\nLegally, services rendered where the client was harmed might be a different matter, but ethically, the domme failed to uphold the agreed boundaries. The user's refusal to pay is because they were not provided safe, consensual service. The domme's threats to spread information are problematic, as they might be trying to intimidate the user into paying despite the service being substandard and potentially harmful.\n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong because the domme didn't follow the safety agreements, leading to a dangerous situation where the user had to protect themselves. The user's right to their safety overrides the payment obligation in this case.\n"
