I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The situation involves a consensual power exchange, but things went wrong. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the safe word and the agreement. The user set up a session with clear limits: medium power max for ballbusting. They had a safe word system using a ball in hand, which they dropped when they couldn't take it anymore. The domme, however, continued after the safe word was triggered, leading to injury.\n\nThe user argues that because the domme violated the safe word and caused harm, they refused to pay. The domme is now threatening to report them to the community. The user's friend, who's also a domme, says they should have paid regardless.\n\nIn consensual BDSM, safety and communication are paramount. The safe word is a fundamental agreement, and ignoring it is a serious breach of trust. The domme's actions went beyond the agreed-upon limits, causing significant harm. The user's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service wasn't delivered as agreed and there was harm caused.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of financial responsibility. The user paid a deposit and agreed to the terms initially. If the session was canceled or not completed due to the domme's fault, the user might not be obligated to pay the full amount. The broken restraint was the user's action in self-preservation, not intentional damage.\n\nThe domme's friend argues that the user is in the wrong because they didn't pay, but the user's priority was their safety and health. The medical necessity to seek help is crucial. The domme's actions led to the injury, so the user isn't at fault for the consequences.\n\nIn summary, the domme violated the agreed terms, caused harm, and the user's refusal to pay is justified. The user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
