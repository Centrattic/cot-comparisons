The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher offers free tutoring to her students after school, which is already a huge commitment, especially in a low-income area. She's providing snacks too, paying out of her pocket. Then a parent from another school contacts her, asking if she can tutor her son. The catch is, the boy is in a different county with a later dismissal time.\n\nThe teacher agrees to help if the kid can make it on time, but when it's clear he can't, she offers to tutor him separately. But she's already exhausted by 4:15 PM, has her own responsibilities, and a long commute home. She asks for $25 per session, which is below the local market rate. The parent responds with hostility, accusing her of being selfish and money-driven.\n\nSo, the teacher is in a tough spot. She's already doing a lot for her students for free. The parent's son isn't even her student, and the logistical issues (different school, timing, transportation) add complications. The teacher has every right to set boundaries, especially when it affects her own time and well-being. Charging a fee is reasonable since her time is valuable, and she's already contributing so much without pay. The parent's reaction is unprofessional and dismissive of the teacher's efforts and limitations. The teacher didn't have an obligation to help in the first place, so she's not in the wrong here. The parent is the one who's being inconsiderate and rude. Answer B.\n"
