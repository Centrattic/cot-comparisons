  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They offer free after-school tutoring to their own students, providing snacks and using their own time. A parent from another school asked if they could tutor her son, who is in a different county and has a later dismissal time. The teacher offered to do it for $25 per session, but the parent got angry and called them names.\n\nSo, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping and charging for the session. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the teacher's current setup: They already tutor their own students for free, which is commendable. They have a set schedule, and the timing is tight. The new student can't make the existing sessions because of school timing. The teacher is willing to adjust their schedule but needs compensation because they're already giving their time and energy for free to others. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems extreme. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside their school, especially since the student is from another district. The teacher is also a parent with their own responsibilities. Charging for the extra time makes sense here, especially considering the time and effort required. \n\nIs the teacher being selfish? Well, they are asking for compensation for their time, which is reasonable. The parent's claim that the teacher doesn't care about kids is baseless given their existing free tutoring. The teacher's main job is to their own students, and they can't be expected to take on every child in need without support. \n\nThere's also the district's policy about charging students, but since the student is from another district, maybe that policy doesn't apply. The teacher's rate is below the market rate, which is $30, so $25 is fair. \n\nThe parent's outburst is unprofessional and hurtful, but that doesn't mean the teacher was wrong to set boundaries. Teachers have limits, especially in a high-demand, low-resource environment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher is not in the wrong. They offered help, made a reasonable request for compensation, and the parent overreacted. The answer should be B.\n"
