  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The teacher is asking if they're in the wrong for not offering free tutoring to a student from a different school. Here's the breakdown.\n\nFirst, the teacher already provides free tutoring for their own students, which is generous. They even cover snacks themselves. That shows they're committed and willing to help within their capacity. Now, a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor their child. The problem is the child is in a different county, the school ends later, so getting there on time isn't feasible. The teacher suggests tutoring at a different time, but that would be later in the evening. The teacher then offers to do it for $25 per session, which is below the local rate. The parent gets angry, calls them names, and accuses them of not caring about kids.\n\nSo, the teacher's position is that they're not in the wrong because they're already overextending with their free sessions. They can't realistically take on another student from a different school without compensation, especially considering their own family responsibilities. The parent expected free help, maybe not considering the teacher's time and energy constraints. The teacher's offer for payment was reasonable but the parent reacted negatively. \n\nThe key points here are the teacher's existing commitments, the logistical issues of the other student, and the parent's unrealistic expectations. The teacher isn't obligated to provide free tutoring beyond their own students, especially when it's not feasible. The parent's reaction is more about their own frustration than the teacher's actions being wrong. So, the answer is B\u2014teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
