  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring for her own students in a low-income area. She's doing this without getting paid, even buying snacks herself. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor their kid, who's in a different county and has a later dismissal time. The teacher says she can do it, but only if the kid arrives on time. When the parent realizes their kid can't make it on time, they ask if the teacher can wait. The teacher then says she can't do it for free anymore and offers to do it for $25, which the parent gets really angry about and calls her names.\n\nSo, the teacher is asking if she's in the wrong for not tutoring the other student when she's already doing it for free for her own students. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing a significant service without compensation. She's using her own time, energy, and money (snacks) to help her own students. That's a lot. Now, she's being asked to extend this to another student who's not even in her school. The parent's son has a later school schedule, so the timing is off. The teacher explains that she's already exhausted by 4:15 PM and needs to get home, which makes sense. She also has her own son's homework to help with. \n\nThen, the teacher offers a paid tutoring session. The parent is upset because they expected her to do it for free. But why did the teacher set the price to $25? The going rate is $30, so she's charging less. The parent might be in a lower-income area, but the teacher is already working in a low-economic area, providing free tutoring. Maybe they expected her to do it for free as well. \n\nIs the teacher wrong for not helping? Well, she's not required to tutor outside students, especially since it's not part of her job. She's already doing a lot for her own students without pay. Asking for compensation for her time when helping someone else might be reasonable. The parent's reaction seems harsh, but maybe they didn't understand the teacher's time constraints and the fact that she's not getting paid for this tutoring. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an expectation in the community that teachers should help any child in need, regardless of cost. But the teacher is in a rural area where resources are limited. She's doing what she can for her own students. The parent's son is in another county, so maybe they should seek help from their own school's resources instead. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't obligated to help another student outside of her school, especially when it's not her responsibility and she's already providing free tutoring. The parent's anger is misplaced because the teacher is within her rights to set boundaries and ask for compensation for her time. The teacher isn't in the wrong here. She's managing her own time and energy, which is important for her well-being and her ability to continue helping her students.\n"
