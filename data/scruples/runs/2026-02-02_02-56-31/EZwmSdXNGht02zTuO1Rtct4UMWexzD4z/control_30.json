The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The teacher is a first-grade teacher in a low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school, providing snacks from their own pocket. A parent from another school (different county) asks for help tutoring their son, who is significantly behind in reading. The teacher initially agrees but then realizes the logistical issues: the child's school ends later, so he can't attend the existing sessions.\n\nThe teacher then offers to tutor the child separately but sets a rate of $25 per session, which is below the local going rate of $30. The parent reacts angrily, calling the teacher names and accusing them of being selfish and not caring about kids. The teacher is now questioning if they're an asshole for not helping for free.\n\nFirst, the teacher's situation: They\u2019re already providing free tutoring, which is a significant time and financial investment. They can't realistically adjust their schedule for a student from another school that ends later. The teacher has their own family responsibilities and work to do after school. The parent's request would require the teacher to stay much later, which is not feasible. \n\nThe parent's reaction is clearly inappropriate. The teacher is under no obligation to help outside of their job, especially since the student isn't even in their class. The teacher is also within their rights to set boundaries and request compensation, given the time and effort required. The parent's accusations that the teacher is selfish or only in it for money are unfounded and harsh.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the teacher isn't wrong for setting limits. They can't be expected to sacrifice their own time and energy indefinitely without support. The parent should have considered the feasibility of the request and maybe found another solution rather than attacking the teacher. The teacher's decision to charge a lower rate than the market is also reasonable to accommodate the parent's possible financial situation.\n\nNo one is in the wrong here, but if I have to pick, the parent's actions are the main issue. The teacher isn't the asshole for maintaining their boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
