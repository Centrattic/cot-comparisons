The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not agreeing to tutor another student outside of their school and charging for it. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students, which is generous. They mention that the district's policy doesn't allow charging their own students for tutoring. The parent from another school approached the teacher about tutoring her son, but the logistics are tough. The child is in a different county and school, which dismisses later.\n\nThe teacher offered to tutor if the child could arrive on time, which he can't because of the school dismissal time. So the parent then wants the teacher to wait until 4:15. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15, works from 6:30 AM, has to drive home, and help their own son with homework. They also mention the market rate for tutoring is $30 an hour, so they asked for $25. The parent got angry and made personal attacks.\n\nNow, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students. The parent is asking for something outside of the original arrangement. The teacher is not obligated to help outside their own school, especially with logistical issues. The teacher tried to accommodate but realized it's not feasible. Charging for the time makes sense as it's market rate, but the teacher can't charge their own students, so the parent might feel it's unfair. However, the teacher isn't required to offer free services beyond their own students. The parent's reaction is extreme, but the teacher isn't necessarily wrong for setting boundaries. They have a right to their time and energy. So the answer is B.\n"
