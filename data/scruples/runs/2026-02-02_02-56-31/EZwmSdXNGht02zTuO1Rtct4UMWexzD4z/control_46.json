The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a first-grade teacher who offers free tutoring after school. The parent of a student from another county asks for tutoring for their son, but the timing doesn't work out. The teacher offers to tutor separately at a cost, and the parent reacts negatively.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring to their own students. They can't tutor another student because of time conflicts. The parent's son is in a different school and arrives too late after the teacher's usual sessions. The teacher is willing to help but needs compensation since they're working late and have personal responsibilities. The parent accuses the teacher of being selfish and only caring about money.\n\nThe key points here are that the teacher is already going above and beyond by offering free tutoring. They have a legitimate reason for not being able to adjust their schedule further, especially considering their personal time and energy. The teacher also isn't in a position to charge their own students, so setting a rate for an external student isn't a conflict of interest. The parent's reaction is hostile and unfair, attacking the teacher's motives without understanding the constraints.\n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. They set boundaries based on their capacity and offered a reasonable solution when possible. The parent is the one being unreasonable by not respecting those boundaries and making personal attacks. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
