The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The teacher already offers free tutoring for her own students, which is commendable. She mentions the school's policy against charging for tutoring, so she's sticking to that with her own kids.\n\nThe parent from another school asked for her help, but the child's school ends later, making it impossible to join the existing sessions. The teacher offered to tutor separately but set a rate of $25 per session. The parent got angry and made hurtful comments. \n\nNow, considering the teacher's situation: she's already giving up her time and energy for free with her own students. She's not obligated to help another school's student, especially when it would require her to stay past 4:15, which she's already exhausted from getting to work at 6:30 AM. Plus, she has her own son to take care of. Charging a fee in this case makes sense because her time is valuable, and she's not in a position to offer unlimited free help. \n\nThe parent's reaction is clearly inappropriate, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. She's being reasonable by asking for compensation for extra time beyond her existing commitments. The fact that the other school is in a different county adds another layer\u2014there's no expectation that she should cross county lines to help without compensation. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't being selfish; she's managing her own resources and time. The parent's accusations about money are misplaced here. The teacher's decision to charge is justified given her circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
