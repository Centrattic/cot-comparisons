The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. So, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school for their own students, provides snacks, and does this without getting paid because their district has a conflict of interest policy. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor their child, who is in a different county and has a later dismissal time.\n\nThe teacher says that due to timing and their own commitments at home, they can't do the same free tutoring for this other student. They offer to charge $25 per session instead, but the parent gets angry and calls them names. The teacher is now questioning if they're an asshole for not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's situation. They're already volunteering their time for free, which is a big sacrifice, especially in a low-income area. The parent approached them out of the blue, expecting the same free service, but the logistical issues (different school, later dismissal) make it impossible for the teacher to provide the same free tutoring. The teacher is also dealing with their own family responsibilities after a long school day. \n\nThe parent seems to have unrealistic expectations. They might not realize the teacher's constraints. The teacher's main job is at their own school, and they can't be expected to accommodate students from another district without proper arrangements. Also, the teacher can't work for free beyond their current capacity because they already have their own students to tutor. Charging a fee is reasonable as a way to compensate for their time, especially since the parent is willing to pay the going rate in the area.\n\nThe parent's reaction is clearly inappropriate and hurtful, but that doesn't mean the teacher is in the wrong. The teacher isn't obligated to help beyond their existing commitments. The decision to charge for the extra time is a professional one, considering the time and resources involved. The teacher isn't being selfish; they're setting boundaries that are necessary for their own well-being and ability to maintain their current tutoring program.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the teacher isn't in the wrong. They're managing their own capacity and making a reasonable request for compensation when extending their services beyond what's feasible for free.\n"
