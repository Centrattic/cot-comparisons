The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping the student from another school. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students after school. They provide snacks, do it for 45 minutes, and it's right after school ends. So that's a commitment they've made. Now, a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who's in a different county and has a later dismissal time.\n\nThe teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM, especially since they have their own son to help with homework and a long drive home. They mention the going rate is $30/hour and offer $25/session. The parent gets angry, calls them names, accuses them of not caring and being selfish.\n\nSo the main points here: The teacher is already giving their time for free. They can't adjust their schedule because of their own commitments. They're asking for payment because they can't do it for free anymore. The parent expects the teacher to go above and beyond without compensation, which the teacher can't do. \n\nThe teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside their school or district. They have personal time and responsibilities. Charging for tutoring isn't necessarily wrong, especially if it's outside their current free tutoring. The parent's reaction is unprofessional and harsh. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong. They made clear the terms and tried to accommodate by charging. The parent's response is the issue here.\n"
