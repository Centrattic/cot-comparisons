  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring sessions after school for their own students because they can't charge due to conflict of interest rules. A parent from another school asked if they could tutor her son, who's in a different county and school. The teacher tried to accommodate but realized the kid couldn't make it on time. The parent then asked for separate sessions, which would mean the teacher would stay late until 4:15, but the teacher is exhausted by then and has to drive home, then help their own son with homework.\n\nThe teacher decided to charge $25 per session because tutoring is unpaid and they wanted compensation. The parent got angry, called them names, and accused them of not caring about kids. The user is wondering if they're an asshole for not tutoring the child and asking for money.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which is a huge commitment. They're paying for snacks and dedicating their time after school. The parent's son is in a different school district and can't attend the existing sessions. The teacher is reasonable to say they can't adjust their existing schedule because of their own energy and personal responsibilities. \n\nAsking for compensation when offering services outside their usual free tutoring makes sense because they're supposed to avoid conflicts of interest with their own students. Charging a rate lower than the market ($25 vs $30) could be seen as a good-faith gesture. The parent's reaction seems disproportionate and vindictive, especially since the teacher tried to accommodate the request.\n\nThe key points are: the teacher is already supporting their own students without pay, the parent's child isn't part of their school, the teacher's personal time is taken into account, and the parent's hostility is unwarranted. The teacher isn't at fault for setting boundaries and seeking fair compensation for extra work. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
