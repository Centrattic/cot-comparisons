  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not helping a student from another school by charging for tutoring. They already tutor their own students for free, but when a parent from another school requested help, they offered to charge $25 per session. The parent got angry, called them names, and accused them of not caring about kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area, which probably means resources are tight. They provide free tutoring, snacks, and time after school. The parent's son is in a different school district, which complicates things. The teacher can't adjust their own schedule easily because they have their own son to help with at home.\n\nThe parent expected the teacher to tutor without compensation, but the teacher asked for $25, which led to the conflict. The user is wondering if they're the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom the teacher's perspective, they've already given their time and resources for their own students. Charging for someone else's time is reasonable, especially since they can't adjust their schedule. The parent's reaction seems unfair because they were the ones who approached the teacher and didn't consider the teacher's constraints. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the teacher could have been more accommodating, but given the circumstances, it's understandable to set boundaries. The teacher isn't obligated to help students from another district, especially when it's outside their job role. The parent's aggressive response is more problematic than the teacher's decision to charge for their time. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, not in the wrong). The teacher isn't obligated to provide free help beyond their existing commitments, and the parent's reaction is unreasonable.\n"
