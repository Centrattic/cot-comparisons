The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a first-grade teacher who offers free tutoring to their students. A parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, but there are logistical issues because he's in a different county and their school dismisses later. The teacher agrees to tutor him separately but asks for $25 per session. The parent gets angry, calls the teacher names, and accuses them of being selfish and in it for money.\n\nSo, the teacher already does free tutoring for their own students, which they can't charge for due to conflict of interest. The parent's son is in a different school, so there's no conflict here. The teacher is offering to help but needs compensation because they're exhausted after a long day and have their own family responsibilities. The parent is upset about the fee, even though the teacher is willing to help outside their normal schedule. \n\nThe key points here are: the teacher is doing a good deed by tutoring for free for their own students. When asked to help another student outside their school, they set boundaries due to personal time and energy. Charging a reasonable rate (which is lower than the market rate) is fair, especially since they can't charge their own students. The parent's reaction is abusive and unfounded. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. The parent is the one being unreasonable and aggressive. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The teacher isn't being selfish; they're managing their own time and energy while offering help when possible. The parent's anger is misplaced.\n"
