  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a first-grade teacher in a low-income area. She offers free after-school tutoring for her students because they can't afford it. She even provides snacks out of her own pocket. Then a parent from another school, who's not in her class, asks if she can tutor her son. The problem is that the boy is in another county, an hour away, so he can't make the usual after-school time. The parent wants the teacher to adjust her schedule to include him later.\n\nThe teacher says that by 4:15 PM, she's already out of energy and needs to go home to help her own son with homework. She also mentions the drive home and the time it takes. She offers to do it for $25 an hour, which is just below the local rate of $30. The parent reacts angrily, calling her names and accusing her of not caring about kids and being selfish. Now the teacher is wondering if she's the asshole for not helping and charging money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's perspective. She's already giving her time and resources for free to her own students. She's in a position where she's stretched thin, especially with her own family responsibilities. Charging for tutoring someone outside her school might seem like a way to compensate for her time, especially when she's already giving so much for free. The parent's accusation that she's in it for the money is harsh, but maybe the teacher felt her time was valuable here.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's child is in need. Since the teacher is in a low-income area, maybe the parent can't afford $25. The teacher might be seen as adding a financial barrier for a child who needs help. But the teacher is also not obligated to help outside her school. She has her own job and family, and it's reasonable to set boundaries. The parent's reaction is clearly over the top and disrespectful, but that doesn't necessarily make the teacher wrong for saying no.\n\nAlso, the teacher can't charge her own students, so offering a fee for someone else might be necessary. The parent's anger might stem from feeling that public service should be free, but the teacher has her own limits. The key points are the teacher's existing commitments, the parent's unreasonable expectations, and the parent's disrespectful response. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong here. She's doing her best within her constraints. The parent's accusations are unfair, especially since the teacher is already helping others for free. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
