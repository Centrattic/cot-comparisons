  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring after school to her first-grade students. She's in a low-income area, pays for snacks herself, and the tutoring is free because of district policies. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor her son, who's in a different county and school. The teacher says she can't do the regular sessions because of timing issues but offers to do it separately for $25. The parent gets angry and calls her names.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for her own students, which is a generous gesture, especially since she's not getting paid for it. She's also taking care of her own child's homework and has a long drive home. The parent's son is in a different school, so it's not part of the original offer. The teacher isn't obligated to help students outside her school or district. \n\nWhen the parent asks for help, the teacher is clear about the time constraints. She offers to do it separately but needs compensation since it's outside her normal schedule and she's already giving up her time for free. The parent is upset because the teacher is charging, but the teacher isn't doing it for profit; she's just trying to cover her own time when it's not feasible to do it for free.\n\nThe parent's reaction seems unreasonable. The teacher isn't required to volunteer her time beyond what she's already doing. The fact that the student is from a different school adds another layer where the teacher isn't responsible for that child. The key points here are the teacher's existing commitments, the parent's unrealistic expectations, and the teacher's right to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong for not helping the other student, especially since she's already giving her time for free to her own students. Charging for additional time when it's not feasible to do it for free is understandable. The parent's anger is misplaced because the teacher isn't obligated to help beyond her capacity and the terms she's set.\n"
