The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong here. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the teacher is in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school, right after dismissal. They provide snacks themselves because they know the kids might be hungry. That's pretty generous. Now, another parent from a different school contacts the teacher, asking for tutoring for her son who's in another county and his school ends later. The teacher says that if the kid can make it on time, they'll help. But the parent's son can't arrive in time because of the school schedule. The parent then asks if the teacher can wait for the kid, which would mean the teacher would have to stay until 4:15, which is later than when the teacher is already exhausted and has other commitments like helping their own son with homework. The drive home would take 40 minutes, getting home around 5:45.\n\nThe teacher offers to tutor for $25 an hour, which is below the local rate. The parent gets angry, calls the teacher names, accuses them of not caring about the kids and only doing it for money. The teacher is now doubting if they're an asshole for not helping.\n\nSo the key points here: the teacher already provides free tutoring for their own students, which is a significant commitment. The new request is for a student from another school, which the teacher isn't obligated to help. The teacher is offering to do it for $25, which is less than the market rate. The parent is upset because they expected the same free help. The teacher is overextended, both in terms of time and energy, and has other responsibilities. The parent's reaction is hostile and personal.\n\nNow, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The teacher is not required to tutor outside their school or for free. They set boundaries regarding their time and energy, and offered a lower rate than the going market price. The parent, however, didn't consider the teacher's existing commitments and expected the same free service. The teacher's refusal isn't about not caring but about practical limitations. The parent's anger seems misplaced, attacking the teacher's character. \n\nIn this context, the teacher is not in the wrong. They made a reasonable offer and the parent was unreasonable in their expectations. The teacher's primary responsibility is to their own school and students, and they can't be expected to accommodate another school's student without compensation. The parent's reaction is the real issue here.\n"
