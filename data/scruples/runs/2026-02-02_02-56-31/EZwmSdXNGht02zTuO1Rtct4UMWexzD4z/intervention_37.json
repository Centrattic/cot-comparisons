  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a first-grade teacher in a low-income rural area. They offer free tutoring sessions after school for their students, providing snacks themselves. A parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son, who is in a different county. The teacher agrees if the child can arrive on time but later realizes it's impossible. The parent then asks if the teacher can tutor separately, which would mean starting later in the day. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per session, which leads to a backlash from the parent.\n\nSo, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which they can't charge for. They can't charge for tutoring their own due to conflict of interest. The parent is asking for a student from another school, which isn't under the teacher's school. So, the teacher is offering to do this as a favor, but not as part of their job. The parent expects the same free service, but the teacher is asking for $25. \n\nIs the teacher allowed to charge? Since their own school doesn't allow charging, but this is a different student, maybe they can? The parent is upset because the teacher is \"in it for the money,\" but the teacher is just trying to cover their time and energy, especially considering they have their own family responsibilities. The parent is in another school district, so the teacher isn't obligated to help them. The teacher's offer is a kindness, but they can set boundaries on their personal time and energy. \n\nThe parent's reaction is harsh and unprofessional, but does the teacher have a right to say no? Also, considering the time they'd need to stay late and the personal time they'd give up, maybe the teacher is justified in asking for compensation. The parent might not realize the teacher's constraints. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong. They provided an offer, and the parent is upset because they expected free help. The teacher's time is valuable, and they can choose to set boundaries. So the answer would be B.\n"
