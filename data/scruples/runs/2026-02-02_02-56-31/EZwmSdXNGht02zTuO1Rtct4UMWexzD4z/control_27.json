The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a first-grade teacher in a low-economic rural area. They offer free tutoring after school to their own students, providing snacks they pay for themselves. A parent from another school, whose best friend's daughter is being tutored, asks if they can tutor her son too. The son is in a different county and school, which dismisses later, so he can't make the existing tutoring time. The parent was told the timing issue and then asked if they could tutor the boy separately. The teacher said they'd be available around 4:15, which is after they get off work at 6:30. But they're exhausted by 4:15 and have to drive home, plus help their own son with homework. So they offer to charge $25 per session. The parent got angry and accused the teacher of not caring and being selfish.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The key points here are: the teacher is already giving free tutoring to their own students, which is a commitment. The new student is from another school, so the teacher isn't responsible for them. The timing doesn't work because the teacher's workday is over. The teacher is also dealing with personal obligations and fatigue. They asked for $25, which is under the market rate, but the parent reacted violently and unprofessionally.\n\nThe teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside their school or work hours. They set clear boundaries by offering to charge a rate lower than the market, which is reasonable. The parent's refusal to accept that and their attack on the teacher's motives are the real issues here. The teacher's decision to not continue volunteering beyond their capacity is justifiable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
