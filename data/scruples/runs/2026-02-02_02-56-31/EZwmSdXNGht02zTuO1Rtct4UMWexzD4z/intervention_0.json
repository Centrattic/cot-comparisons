  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school as part of their job, including providing snacks. A parent from another school asked if they could tutor her son, but he's in a different county and school with a later dismissal. The teacher initially agreed to adjust their schedule but when they tried to set a time, the timing didn't work. The parent then wanted the teacher to tutor her son separately, which would mean the teacher would stay much later, driving home even later. The teacher offered to charge $25 per session because they can't do it for free due to exhaustion and other responsibilities. The parent got angry and insulted the teacher.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the teacher is already providing free tutoring at their school. They can't tutor more without compensation because they have their own time and energy to consider. The parent's son is in a different school and county, so maybe the teacher isn't responsible for that student. The teacher isn't obligated to work extra hours outside their job's scope. Charging for tutoring isn't against district policy here, but the teacher's own district prohibits charging for tutoring their own students. However, in this case, the student isn't theirs, so maybe the policy doesn't apply. But the teacher is setting a precedent by charging, which the parent didn't expect, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe key points are: the teacher is overextending themselves, the parent didn't realize the logistical challenges, and the teacher's attempt to charge was seen as selfish. However, the teacher is within their rights to set boundaries and charge for their time outside the school's free tutoring. The parent's reaction is extreme, but maybe the teacher could have communicated better about the constraints before the parent assumed the tutoring was free. Alternatively, maybe the teacher is not in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs after work hours. Public service often requires balance between helping others and self-care. The teacher's job already includes free tutoring, and they can't be expected to do more without compensation. The parent's anger stems from not understanding the teacher's limitations, but the teacher isn't obligated to help beyond their professional duties. So the answer is B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
