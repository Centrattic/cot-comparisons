  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is being asked if they're an asshole for not helping a student from another school with tutoring. The situation involves a parent whose child needs help, but due to logistical issues, they can't fit into the existing tutoring schedule. The teacher offers to tutor the child separately but at a fee. The parent reacts negatively, leading the teacher to question their own actions.\n\nFirst, the teacher already provides free tutoring for their own students, which is commendable. They even provide snacks at their own expense. When the parent from another school asks for help, the teacher faces a conflict because the child's school schedule doesn't align with the existing tutoring times. The teacher then offers to adjust their schedule but expects compensation for the time, which is reasonable given that they're already providing free tutoring and have personal commitments.\n\nThe key points here are the teacher's right to set boundaries and the parent's reaction. The teacher isn't obligated to help students outside their school, especially when it involves personal time and energy. Charging a fee for that additional help is justified, considering the financial and time investment. The parent's aggressive response seems unwarranted, especially since they didn't consider the teacher's constraints. The teacher isn't in the wrong here because they're maintaining professional boundaries and seeking fair compensation for their time. The parent's accusations about not caring for kids are baseless given the teacher's existing commitment to their students.\n"
