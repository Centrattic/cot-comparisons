  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring to her own students after school, providing snacks and spending her own time. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor her son, who is in a different county and a different school. The teacher agrees to do it for a fee, but the parent gets angry and calls her names.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing a lot for her own students without getting paid. She's using her own time, buying snacks, and helping kids who are struggling. That seems really generous. The parent from another school comes in and wants her services too, but the timing is an issue because their school lets out later. The teacher is tired by 4:15 PM after a long day and has her own responsibilities. So she offers to do it for $25 per session. The parent is upset and accuses her of being selfish and money-driven.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The parent's son is in a different school district, which might mean the teacher isn't even supposed to tutor him if there are conflicts of interest or district policies. Also, tutoring outside students could be against school regulations. The teacher isn't getting paid by her district for the existing tutoring, so charging for another student might not be an issue, but maybe there are other rules. The parent's reaction is harsh, but if the teacher is within her rights and not violating any policies, she might not be at fault. The teacher is also human and has her own time and energy to consider. She's trying to balance her job with her family, so saying no after a long day is understandable. The parent's son's needs are valid, but the teacher isn't obligated to help beyond her own students. Charging a fee is her way to compensate for her time, which is reasonable. The parent's anger is misplaced if the teacher is not required to help and is acting within her rights. So, the answer is probably B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
