The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school for their own students, providing snacks and using their own time. A parent from another school contacts them about tutoring her son, who is in a different county and school that ends later. The teacher initially thought it might work but then realized the timing wouldn't fit. The parent then asked if they could tutor separately, which would mean the teacher has to stay until 4:15 PM, which is after their own energy is drained and before they need to go home to help their own son. The teacher offered $25 per session, which is less than the local market rate of $30. The parent got angry, accused the teacher of not caring and being selfish.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing a service for free for their own students, which is commendable. They have limited time and energy. The new request is for a student they don't teach, from a different school and county. The parent's son's school ends later, making the timing impossible unless the teacher stays much later. The teacher is already giving up their own time and resources. Asking for compensation in this scenario makes sense because the teacher is sacrificing personal time and their own family responsibilities. The parent's reaction is hostile and dismissive of the teacher's needs and the value of their time. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside their current commitments, especially when it affects their personal life. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and asking for fair pay for additional work. The answer should be B.\n"
