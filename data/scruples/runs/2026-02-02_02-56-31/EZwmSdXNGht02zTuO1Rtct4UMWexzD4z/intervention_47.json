  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring to their students after school, providing snacks as well. Another parent from a different school asked if they could tutor her son, who is in a different county. The teacher agreed if the kid could get there on time, but it turned out he couldn't. The parent then asked if the teacher could tutor him later, but the teacher was too tired and had their own commitments. The teacher offered to do it for $25 per session, but the parent got angry and made hurtful comments.\n\nSo the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The user is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for not helping.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring to their own students. They can't just take on extra students from another school without compensation, especially since they're already giving up their time and money for snacks. The parent's son is from a different district, so it's not like the teacher is obligated to help them. The teacher's offer to charge $25 is reasonable, considering the time and effort, and the going rate in the area is $30. The parent's reaction seems harsh because they expected free help, but the teacher isn't required to do that. The teacher also has personal responsibilities, like helping their own son with homework. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong here. They set boundaries and offered a fair rate when asked. The parent's anger stems from misunderstanding or unreasonable expectations. The teacher can't be responsible for every child in need outside their job, especially when it's not their responsibility. So the answer should be B, No, they're not in the wrong.\n"
