The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. \n\nFirst, the author is a first-grade teacher in a low-income area. They already offer free tutoring after school, provide snacks, and do this without getting paid. That's a lot of dedication. Now, another parent asks for tutoring their son, who is in a different county and school. The timing doesn't work because the other school gets out later, so the kid can't make the existing sessions. The parent wants the author to adjust their schedule to accommodate this.\n\nThe author is already exhausted by 4:15 PM after working until 2:40 PM and then driving home. They also have their own son's homework to help with. They offer to tutor for $25 per session, which is under the local market rate. The parent reacts angrily, accusing the author of being selfish and not caring about kids.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author is already giving their time for free to their own students, the other parent's request is outside the normal arrangement, and the author is asking for compensation due to their time constraints. The parent seems to have unreasonable expectations, expecting free help without considering the teacher's existing workload and personal time.\n\nThe author isn't obligated to tutor students outside their school, especially when it's a different county. They're also not in a position to provide unpaid tutoring beyond their capacity. Charging a fair rate isn't unreasonable here. The parent's anger is misplaced because the author is already doing a lot for free and can't just extend their hours without compensation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They set boundaries, which is necessary for their own well-being. The parent's outburst and accusations are the real issues here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
