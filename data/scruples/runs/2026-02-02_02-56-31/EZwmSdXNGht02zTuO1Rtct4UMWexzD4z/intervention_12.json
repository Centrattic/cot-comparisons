  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. They're a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They already tutor their own students for free after school, providing snacks and spending their own time. A parent from another school asked if they could tutor her son, but he's from a different county and school that ends later. The teacher offered to do it only if the kid could come on time, which he couldn't. Then the parent wanted separate sessions later, but the teacher said they couldn't due to being tired and needing to help their own son. They asked for $25 per hour, which the parent got angry about.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the teacher is already giving their time and resources for free to their own students. The new request is outside their school's jurisdiction and would require extra time and energy. The teacher is not obligated to help students from another school, especially when they're already stretched thin. They tried to accommodate by adjusting the time, but the parent's son's schedule didn't allow it. Then the teacher suggested charging, which the parent took as being greedy or uncaring. \n\nThe teacher's actions seem reasonable. They can't be expected to offer free tutoring beyond their own responsibilities. Charging a reasonable rate for their time is fair, especially since they're using personal time after a long day. The parent overreacted, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They\u2019re doing a lot already for their own students without compensation, so it's understandable they can't take on more without being paid. The answer should be B, they're not the asshole for not tutoring someone outside their school's scope.\n"
