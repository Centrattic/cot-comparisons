The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring for her own students, which she does out of her own time and money. Now, a parent from another school contacts her about tutoring their son. The problem is that the child is in a different county and school, so getting him there on time isn't feasible. The teacher offers to adjust her schedule, but by 4:15 PM she's already exhausted from her day job and has to drive home, plus help her own son with homework. She sets a rate of $25 per session, which is under the local market rate. The parent reacts angrily, calling her names and accusing her of caring only about money.\n\nFirst, the teacher's initial setup is entirely voluntary. She's already giving her time and money to her own students, which is commendable. The parent from another school is essentially asking her to extend this unpaid help to a student she doesn't even teach. The teacher isn't obligated to do that. When the parent can't meet the time constraints, the teacher asks for compensation. The parent takes offense. \n\nIs the teacher wrong? Well, she's within her rights to set boundaries. She's not required to volunteer her time beyond what she's already doing. The parent's son isn't her student, and the situation is logistically challenging. Charging $25 is under the market rate, so it's fair. The parent's reaction is unprofessional and hostile. The teacher isn't being selfish for setting limits on her available time and energy, especially when she's already sacrificing a lot for her current students. Therefore, the teacher isn't in the wrong here.\n"
