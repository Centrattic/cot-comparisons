  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-economic area. They offer free tutoring after school to their own students, including snacks paid for out of pocket. A parent from another school asked if they could tutor her son, even though he's in a different county and school. The teacher agreed but then realized the timing wouldn't work due to the other school's dismissal and their own schedule. They offered to tutor separately but at $25 per session, which is below the market rate. The parent reacted angrily, accusing the teacher of being selfish and money-driven.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. So the main points here are about the teacher's decision to not help the student from another school and charging a fee. The teacher is in a position where they're already giving their time and resources for free to their own students. The parent's son is from a different school, which complicates things. The teacher has a valid reason for not being able to adjust their current schedule\u2014energy levels and family responsibilities. Charging $25, even though it's less than the average rate, is a way to compensate themselves for their time and effort. \n\nThe parent's anger seems exaggerated. The teacher didn't refuse to help out of malice but due to practical constraints. The parent's accusations about caring for kids and being in it for money are harsh, especially since the teacher is already providing free services to their own students. The teacher's offer to tutor the child separately but at a cost was a reasonable attempt to find a middle ground. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding their time and energy. They have a right to expect some compensation when deviating from their existing free service, especially given the logistical challenges. The parent's reaction is more about the emotional response to being refused rather than the teacher's actual actions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the teacher is not in the wrong).\n"
