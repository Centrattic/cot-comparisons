  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area and already offers free tutoring after school for her own students. She provides snacks and spends her own time and money to help. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor their child, who is in a different county and has a later school schedule. The teacher agrees to do it for $25, but the parent gets angry and calls her names.\n\nSo the main question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping without charging. Let me consider the points. She's already volunteering her time and resources for her own students, which is commendable. The parent's child is in a different school, so the teacher isn't obligated to help them. She tried to accommodate but realized the timing wasn't feasible. When asked to adjust her schedule, she offered to do it for a fee, which is reasonable since she's not getting paid for this extra work. The parent's reaction is clearly inappropriate, but the teacher isn't wrong for setting boundaries and asking for compensation for her time. Teachers aren't paid for extra work, so it's fair for her to expect some payment, especially when it's outside her normal duties. The parent's accusations that she doesn't care are unfounded because she's already helping others for free. Therefore, the teacher isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
