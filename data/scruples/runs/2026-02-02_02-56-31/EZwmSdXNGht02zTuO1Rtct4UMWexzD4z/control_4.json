The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring after school to her first-grade students. She already spends time and money on snacks and the tutoring is free because of her district's policy. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor their son, who is in a different county and school. The parent's son is behind in reading.\n\nThe teacher says she can't take him during the regular tutoring time because he can't get there on time. The parent asks her to tutor him separately, which would be after school hours. The teacher offers to do this for $25 per session, which is less than the local rate of $30/hour. The parent gets angry and accuses her of being selfish and only interested in money.\n\nHmm. The teacher is already doing free tutoring that she's personally funding. She's working in a low-economic area where she's providing snacks and time. She's not required to tutor outside her school's students, especially someone from another district. The parent's son's school ends later, so timing is an issue. The teacher isn't in a position to offer free tutoring because she's already stretched. She asks for compensation, which is reasonable given she's using her personal time and energy. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems harsh. The teacher isn't obligated to help beyond her own students, and charging for her time when she's not getting paid for it is fair. The parent's accusations that she doesn't care about kids are unfounded. The teacher is trying to help but can't afford to give up her evening time for free when she has her own family responsibilities. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The teacher isn't in the wrong here. She's managing her own resources and setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The parent is being unreasonable in expecting free help and attacking her character.\n"
