The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the teacher is asking if they're an asshole for not helping another student from a different school who can't make the existing tutoring time.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students. They spend their own time and money on snacks. That's pretty generous. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor their son who's in a different county. The timing doesn't work because the other school lets out later, so the kid would arrive after the teacher's usual sessions. The teacher says they can't do it for free because they're exhausted by 4:15, have their own kid's homework to help with, and a long drive home. So they offer to charge $25 per session. The parent gets really upset, calls them names, accuses them of being selfish and not caring about kids.\n\nThe teacher is wondering if they're in the wrong. The key points here are: the teacher is already providing a free service, the new student is from a different school district, which complicates things logistically. The teacher is clearly overworked, given the rural, low-income setting, and they're already giving up their time and resources. They're asking for compensation for their time, which is reasonable given the $30/hour market rate. The parent's reaction is hostile and unfair. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong here. They set boundaries because they can't manage their time and energy anymore. The parent should probably reach out to their own district for support instead of expecting a teacher from another school to take responsibility. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside their job, especially when it conflicts with personal needs and existing commitments. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
