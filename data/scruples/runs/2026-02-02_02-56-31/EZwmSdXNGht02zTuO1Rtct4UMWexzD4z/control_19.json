The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area, which is important context. They offer free tutoring after school to their own students, paying for snacks themselves. A parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor their child, but the kid is from a different county and school, with a later dismissal time. The teacher initially agrees but then realizes the timing won't work unless they tutor separately. The parent's kid would arrive late, and the teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM after a long day.\n\nThe teacher offers to do it for $25 per session, which is below the local going rate of $30. The parent gets angry, accuses the teacher of being money-driven and not caring about kids. The teacher is confused if they're in the wrong for not helping for free.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing a service for free for their own students. They can't tutor another student from a different school, which adds logistical challenges. The teacher's time is limited, especially after a long school day, and they need time to assist their own child. Charging for their time here is reasonable since they're not getting paid for this extra work. The parent's expectation that the teacher should do this for free, especially while the teacher is already doing it for others without pay, seems unfair. The parent's reaction is hostile and invalidates the teacher's need for compensation. So the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and asking for payment. Answer B.\n"
