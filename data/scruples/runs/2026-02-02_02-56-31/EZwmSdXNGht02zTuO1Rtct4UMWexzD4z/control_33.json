The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher in the situation is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students. They can't charge because of conflict of interest rules. The parent of a student from another school asks for help, but there's a scheduling conflict.\n\nThe teacher offers to tutor the other student for a fee of $25 per session. The parent gets angry and accuses them of being selfish and only in it for money. The teacher feels conflicted but thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points: The teacher is doing free tutoring for their own students, which is generous. The other parent's child is at a different school with a later dismissal time, making the existing schedule impossible. The teacher proposes charging because they can't do it for free without compensation. The parent reacts negatively. \n\nThe key factors here are whether the teacher is obligated to help outside their own school, and whether charging a fee is wrong. Since the teacher can't charge for their own students, but this student is from another school, maybe there's no conflict here. The teacher is within their rights to set boundaries and charge for their time. The parent's accusation that the teacher is in it for money is unfair because the teacher is already giving their time freely for their own students. \n\nAlso, the teacher has personal commitments and can't stay late. It's reasonable to say no or charge for extra time. The parent's reaction is inappropriate, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting limits. So the answer should be B.\n"
