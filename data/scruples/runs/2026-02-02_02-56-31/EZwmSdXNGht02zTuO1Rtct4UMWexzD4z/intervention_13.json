  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the teacher is asking if they're in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school for their own students. They take time, provide snacks, and do it all for free. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor their son, who's in a different county and school. The timing doesn't work because the other school ends later, so the kid can't make the existing sessions. The teacher suggests tutoring separately but asks for $25 per session. The parent gets angry and makes harsh comments.\n\nSo the teacher is wondering if refusing to help without compensation makes them an asshole. Let's think about the key points here. The teacher is already volunteering their time and resources for their own students. They\u2019re not required to tutor outside of their job, especially for another school's student. The parent approached them outside of their official responsibilities. The teacher is also juggling their own family time, needing to get home to help their son with homework. \n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. If they're not obligated to help in the first place, then maybe they\u2019re not in the wrong. They did offer to help if the parent could get the kid there on time, but when that wasn't possible, they asked for compensation. The parent was upset, but the teacher isn't in a position where they have to provide services outside their job for free. Plus, the teacher is already giving a lot of their time for free with their own students. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a perception of inconsistency. The teacher is helping their own students for free but charging another parent. But the other child isn't their student, so that's different. Also, the teacher can't realistically extend their day further without compensation. The parent's reaction is harsh, but the teacher isn't obligated to help. So I think the answer is B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
