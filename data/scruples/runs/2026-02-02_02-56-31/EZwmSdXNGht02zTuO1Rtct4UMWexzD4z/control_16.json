The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from a different school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. She offers free tutoring after school to her students. She even provides snacks, which she pays for herself. That seems generous and caring. Now, a parent from another school contacts her because their child is struggling with reading. The child is in a different county, about an hour away, and their school dismisses later. So the child can't make it to the existing tutoring session which starts at 2:50 PM. The parent asks if the teacher can tutor separately. \n\nThe teacher says she's already stretched thin. She gets to work at 6:30 AM and by 4:15 PM (when the other school lets out), she's out of energy. She also has to help her own son with homework. The drive home takes 40 minutes. So if she's tutoring until 4:15, she wouldn't get home until around 5:45 PM. She offers to do it for $25 per session, which is $25 under the local going rate of $30/hour. The parent gets really angry, calls her names, accuses her of being in it for the money, etc.\n\nNow, the teacher is asking if she's the asshole for not tutoring the kid from a different school. So the key points here are: \n\n1. The teacher already provides free tutoring for her own students. She can't take on more without compensation because of the timing and personal commitments.\n2. She's willing to offer the service for a fee, which is lower than the market rate.\n3. The parent is upset about being asked for money and calls the teacher names.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the teacher is already volunteering her time for her own students, paying out of pocket for snacks. She's in a rural area where resources might be limited. She's not obligated to help students from another school, especially since they have different schedules. She's setting boundaries because she's exhausted and has personal responsibilities. Offering to do it for a lower rate than market shows she's trying to help but within her limits.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might feel the teacher is being selfish, but the teacher is asking for compensation for her time, which is reasonable. The parent's reaction is extreme, but the teacher's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The teacher isn't responsible for the child's education if the child isn't her student. Plus, she's already helping her own students without pay. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially when it affects her own family time and energy.\n\nSo the answer is probably B, the teacher isn't in the wrong. She's being reasonable in her boundaries. The parent's reaction is inappropriate, but that doesn't make the teacher the asshole for not helping beyond her capacity.\n"
