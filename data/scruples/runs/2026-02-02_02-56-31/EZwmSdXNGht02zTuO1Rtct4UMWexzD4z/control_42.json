The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The teacher is offering free tutoring for her own students because of the low economic area. She's already committed her time after school, providing snacks, and it's clear she's doing this altruistically.\n\nThen a parent from another school asks her to tutor their child who's in a different county. The parent's son can't make the existing tutoring time because their school ends later. The teacher offers to tutor them separately but needs compensation since she's already giving up her time for her own students and has other responsibilities. She asks for $25 per session, which is under the market rate. The parent reacts angrily, attacking her and implying she's selfish and not caring about kids.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The teacher already has a commitment to her students, and tutoring another student from a different school would require her to stay much later, which is a significant personal sacrifice. Plus, she's working another job (helping her own son with homework), and driving home late. She's not in a position to provide free help beyond her existing commitments. The parent's request is outside the scope of her existing tutoring, which is for her own students. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor other students, especially from a different school. The parent's anger seems unwarranted because the teacher is setting boundaries and compensating for her time. The fact that she's charging less than market rate shows she's still being considerate. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
