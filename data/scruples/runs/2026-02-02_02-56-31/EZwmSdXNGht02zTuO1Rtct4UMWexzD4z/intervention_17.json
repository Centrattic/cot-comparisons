  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring for their students after school. A parent from another school asks if they can have the teacher tutor their son, who's in a different county and school. The teacher says they can't do the regular sessions because the timing doesn't work, but offers to do it separately for $25 per session. The parent gets really angry and calls the teacher names, saying they're selfish and only in it for money. The teacher is now doubting themselves.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which is a lot of work. They even buy snacks themselves. That's generous. Now the parent wants tutoring for another student outside of their school. The teacher isn't their employee, so there's no obligation. The timing is an issue because the other school lets out later, and the teacher is already tired by 4:15. The teacher offers to do it for pay, which makes sense because they're giving up their personal time. The parent reacts negatively, accusing the teacher of not caring about kids and being greedy.\n\nThe key points here are whether the teacher is obligated to help another student from a different school. Since they're not in the same district, the teacher isn't responsible for that student. Offering paid tutoring isn't against the conflict of interest policy here because it's a different student. The parent's anger seems misplaced because the teacher is trying to offer an alternative, not refusing without reason. The teacher is also balancing their own family responsibilities, which is understandable.\n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. They provided a solution when the original plan wasn't feasible and communicated clearly. The parent's reaction was harsh and unfair. The teacher had every right to ask for compensation for their time outside of work hours. Therefore, the answer should be B, the teacher isn't the asshole.\n"
