  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a first-grade teacher in a low-income rural area. They tutor students after school for free, providing snacks and their own time. A parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son, who is in a different county and has different dismissal times. The user offers to tutor if the child can arrive on time, but the parent's kid can't. Then the parent asks if they can adjust the time. The user says they can't because they're too exhausted by then and also have their own son's homework. They set a fee of $25, but the parent gets angry and accuses them of being selfish and money-driven.\n\nSo the question is, is the user in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the user is already giving up their time and resources to tutor their own students for free. That's a significant sacrifice. The parent is asking for a favor that isn't part of the original arrangement. The student isn't even in their school, which adds logistical issues. The user can't reasonably be expected to adjust their schedule to accommodate someone from a different county, especially when it conflicts with personal time. Charging a fee is a way to value their time, especially when they're already doing this for free for their own students. The parent's anger seems misplaced because the user isn't obligated to help outside their own responsibilities. The user isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here.\n"
