The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is in a rural, low-income area. She already offers free tutoring after school for her own students, providing snacks and paying for them herself. That's a lot of dedication. Now, a parent from another school contacts her, asking if she can tutor her son, who is in a different county and has conflicting dismissal times. The teacher says she's willing but would need to adjust the timing. However, the parent's son can't come to the existing sessions because of the schedule.\n\nThe teacher then offers to tutor the boy separately but at a cost of $25 per session, which is below the local rate. The parent reacts negatively, calling her names and accusing her of not caring about kids. The teacher is upset because she feels the request is asking her to work late, which is tiring, and she has her own family responsibilities. She's also already giving her time for free to her own students.\n\nSo, is the teacher wrong? Well, she's under no obligation to tutor another school's student, especially when it's outside her school's hours and her own capacity. She's already doing a lot for free. Charging for the extra time seems reasonable given the local rate. The parent's reaction is aggressive and unfair. The teacher didn't agree to the request; she set boundaries. The parent expected her to do this for free, which is not necessarily the case. The teacher's main responsibility is to her own students, and she's not at fault for prioritizing her time and energy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
