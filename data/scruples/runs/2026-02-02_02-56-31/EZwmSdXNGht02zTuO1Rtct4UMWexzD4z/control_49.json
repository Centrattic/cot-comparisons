The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. So first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The teacher offers free tutoring for their own students, which is already a big deal because they're in a low-income area. They even provide snacks out of their own pocket.\n\nNow, a parent from another school contacts the teacher, asking for help with their son. The problem is the son is in a different county and school, which dismisses later. The teacher initially thought it was possible if the parent could get the kid there by 2:50, but that's not feasible. Then the parent asks for a separate time, which would be after 4:15 when the teacher is tired and has other commitments. The teacher offers to tutor for $25 per session, but the parent gets angry and calls the teacher names, accusing them of being selfish and not caring about kids.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the teacher wrong for not tutoring the other student? Let's break it down. The teacher already does a lot for their own students without pay. They have limited time and energy. The other student is not their student, from a different school. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside of their school. Also, the parent approached them directly without going through proper channels, which might be an issue. The teacher is in a rural, low-economic area, so maybe there's a lack of resources, but the teacher isn't responsible for other schools' students. The parent's reaction is over the top, but the teacher's refusal isn't the problem here. The teacher is prioritizing their own responsibilities and well-being. So, the answer is likely B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
