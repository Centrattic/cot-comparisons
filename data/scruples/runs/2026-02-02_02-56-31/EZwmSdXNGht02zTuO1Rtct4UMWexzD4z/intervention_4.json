  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The teacher is asking if they're in the wrong for not helping a student from another school by charging for tutoring. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students, which is really commendable. They even provide snacks and do it after school, which shows dedication. But when a parent from another school asks for tutoring, the challenge comes in. \n\nThe main issue is that the other school is in a different county and has a later dismissal time. So the student can't make the original tutoring session. The teacher offers to tutor separately for $25 per session. The parent reacts negatively, calling them names and accusing them of being selfish.\n\nNow, the teacher is conflicted because they want to help but have their own limits. Let's break it down.\n\nThe teacher's district policy probably doesn't allow charging students for tutoring, but since the student is from a different school, maybe that policy doesn't apply. However, the teacher is in a low-economic area where charging might not be feasible for the parent. The teacher mentions the going rate is $30, but they offered $25, which is lower. They also have personal reasons: driving home, helping their own son, and being exhausted by 4:15 PM.\n\nThe parent's reaction is harsh because they expected free help, maybe out of desperation. The teacher isn't in the wrong because they set clear boundaries. They were already giving their time for free with their students but can't extend that to another child's schedule without compensation. The parent's accusations are unfair because they didn't consider the teacher's time and energy. \n\nAlso, the teacher's primary responsibility is to their own students and their family. They can't be expected to accommodate another school's student without proper support. The parent should have approached the other school's system for help instead of expecting the teacher to bend over backwards. \n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher isn't the asshole. They made a reasonable offer and the parent overreacted without understanding the teacher's constraints. The answer should be B.\n"
