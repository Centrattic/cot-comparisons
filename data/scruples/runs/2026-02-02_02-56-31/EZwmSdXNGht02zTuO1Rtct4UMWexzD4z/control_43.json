The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The teacher offers free tutoring for their own students because of the conflict of interest policy. That makes sense. Then a parent from another school asks for tutoring for her son who's in a different county and school with later dismissal. The teacher initially thought the child could come to their session but realized it's impossible. So they ask if the parent can bring the kid later, but the teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 and has other responsibilities like helping their own son with homework.\n\nThe teacher then offers to tutor separately for $25 per session, which is under the local rate of $30. The parent gets angry and accuses the teacher of not caring about kids and being selfish. The question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping and charging for the extra time.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing free tutoring for their own students. They can't just extend that to another school district's student for free. The school's policy probably restricts them from charging their own students, but this is a different case. However, the teacher is a public employee, so there might be policies against private tutoring, even if it's not their own students. But the teacher is offering a service outside the school, which is allowed as long as it doesn't conflict with their duties.\n\nThe parent's child is in another district, so the teacher isn't obligated to help. The teacher explains the timing issues and offers a reasonable rate. The parent's reaction is clearly inappropriate, but the teacher isn't wrong for setting boundaries. They have a right to their time and energy. Charging a fair rate isn't selfish when it's outside the scope of their job and voluntary. The teacher isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
