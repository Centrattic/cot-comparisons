The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is asking if they're an asshole for not helping a student from another school. They already tutor their own students for free, providing snacks and spending their own time. Another parent from a different school asks for tutoring, but the timing doesn't work because the other school finishes later. The teacher offers to help separately but charges $25 per session when they can't adjust their schedule due to personal commitments. The parent gets angry and accuses the teacher of not caring and being selfish.\n\nFirst, the teacher's initial setup: they tutor their own students for free, which is generous. They provide snacks and do it after school, which is already a stretch. The parent from another school approaches, and the teacher is sympathetic. The problem is the time conflict. The teacher can't adjust their schedule because they leave work early and have a long drive home, plus helping their own kid with homework. Charging $25 is to compensate for their time. The parent is upset about the charge and the refusal.\n\nThe key points here are the teacher's existing commitments and their right to set boundaries. They're already giving a lot of their time for free. Charging for additional hours when they can't adjust their schedule seems reasonable because it's outside their normal workload and personal time. The parent's reaction is harsh, but the teacher isn't obligated to help outside their capacity, especially when it's not their student and they can't adjust their schedule. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and seeking compensation for their time. The parent's accusations about caring for kids are baseless given the teacher's prior actions. So the answer is B.\n"
