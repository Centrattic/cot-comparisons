  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school, providing snacks and time. Another parent from a different school asked if the teacher could tutor her son, even though he's in a different county and school with a later dismissal. The teacher offered to do it for $25 per session because of the time and energy. The parent got angry, called them names, and accused them of not caring about kids.\n\nSo the question is, is the teacher in the wrong? Let's break it down. The teacher is already giving their time for free to their own students, which is commendable. They pay for snacks, which shows they're invested. When another parent comes in, the teacher is asked to extend that help to a different school's student. The main issue is compensation. The teacher can't work for free here because they have their own family obligations and energy limits. They set a price, but the parent reacted negatively.\n\nLegally, the teacher can't charge their own students because of conflict of interest, but this is a different student. So charging $25 isn't a conflict. Ethically, the teacher isn't obligated to help students outside their school or district. They're under no obligation to offer free tutoring beyond their own students, especially when it's a different school. The parent's anger seems misplaced. They were the ones who approached the teacher, and the teacher made it clear the terms. The parent didn't respect the teacher's time and personal life. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and charging for their time when it's not their responsibility. So answer B, the teacher isn't an asshole.\n"
