The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the teacher is tutoring students for free after school, right? They provide snacks and it's all on their own time. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son, but he goes to a different county and school. The teacher says if the kid can get there on time, they'll help. But the kid can't because his school ends later. The parent then wants the teacher to adjust their schedule, which would mean the teacher would be working until like 4:15 PM. The teacher is already exhausted by that time, has to go home, help their own kid, and the drive home is 40 minutes. So they offer to do it for $25 per session, but the parent gets really angry and calls them names.\n\nHmm. The teacher is already doing a lot for free, and this new request is outside their current commitments. They're offering to charge market rate, which is $30, but they ask for $25. The parent is upset because they expected free help, maybe? But the teacher can't just do it for free because of time and energy constraints. The parent is in a low-economic area, but the teacher is already helping students from their own school. The parent's son is in a different county, so it's an extra effort. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong here. They set boundaries and tried to be helpful, but when the situation isn't feasible, they ask for compensation. The parent overreacted. The teacher is already giving their time and resources for their own students without pay. It's reasonable to charge for extra work outside their normal duties. So the answer should be B, the teacher isn't the asshole.\n"
