The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring sessions for their own students after school. They provide snacks and do this without charging because their district policies say they can't for their own students. Then a parent from another school, whose child is in a different county and school, asks if the teacher can tutor her son. The teacher agrees if the kid can make it on time, but the kid's school dismisses later, so he can't make the 2:50 PM session. The parent then asks if the teacher can tutor him separately, which would mean the kid arrives around 4:15 PM. The teacher is already tired by then, has to drive home, and help their own son with homework. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per session, which is below the local going rate of $30. The parent gets angry, calls the teacher names, accuses them of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing free tutoring for their own students. They can't charge for those sessions because of conflict of interest policies. So when the parent from another school asks for tutoring, the teacher is not obligated to provide it, especially since the kid isn't their student. The teacher is within their rights to say no. However, they tried to accommodate by offering a later session but then had to ask about compensation. \n\nThe key point here is the compensation. The teacher is providing a service outside their job, for a student they don't have a formal responsibility for. They mention they can't charge their own students, but this is a different case. Charging a fair rate for their time isn't unreasonable. The parent's reaction seems excessive because they expected the teacher to do this for free, maybe assuming that since they're a teacher, they should volunteer their time. But the teacher has personal commitments and energy limits. \n\nThe teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and seeking compensation for their time. They were already giving free tutoring, but this new request is outside their existing commitments. The parent's anger stems from misunderstanding or unfair expectations. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
