  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a first-grade teacher who offers free tutoring after school to students in need. The parent of a student from another school asks if the teacher can tutor their son too, but there's a time conflict because the boy's school ends later. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per session, and the parent reacts angrily, calling her names and accusing her of not caring.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring at her school. She's not getting paid and actually pays for snacks herself. That seems pretty generous. The parent from another school is asking for something that's outside of the teacher's normal setup. The teacher can't adjust her schedule because she's already exhausted by 4:15 and has her own family to take care of. She's asking for compensation, which is reasonable given the time and effort required. The parent is upset because they expected free help, but the teacher can't just work for free outside her regular commitments.\n\nThe key points here are the teacher's boundaries and the parent's expectations. The teacher isn't obligated to help a student from another school, especially when it's not part of her job. She's already contributing a lot by tutoring her own students for free. Charging for the extra time makes sense because she's sacrificing her personal time and energy. The parent's reaction is harsh and unfair, attacking her character and motives. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting limits and seeking fair compensation for her time. So, the answer should be B.\n"
