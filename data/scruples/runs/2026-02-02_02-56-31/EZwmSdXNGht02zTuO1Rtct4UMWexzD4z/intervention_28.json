  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. She offers free tutoring after school for her students, which is within the school's policy. She provides snacks herself and has a specific schedule. Then a parent from another school contacts her about tutoring her son, who is in a different county and school. The user says she can't do it because of timing and energy issues, but offers to do it for $25 per session when the boy arrives later. The parent gets angry and accuses her of being selfish and in it for money.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. She's already providing free tutoring for her own students, which is generous. The parent's child is in a different school and county, so the user isn't obligated to help. The parent approached her out of the blue, expecting the same free arrangement. The user tried to accommodate by offering a later time but needed compensation for her time, especially considering her own responsibilities. The parent reacted angrily, implying the user doesn't care about kids. \n\nIs the user wrong for asking for payment? Well, the original tutoring is free because it's part of her job and within the district's policy. However, helping a student from another school isn't part of her job. Charging for that time is understandable, especially since she's using her personal time and resources. The parent might not realize that the user can't just extend her free service indefinitely, especially when it conflicts with her personal time and responsibilities. \n\nThe user isn't obligated to tutor another school's child, especially without compensation. Her job is with her own students. The parent's anger seems to stem from a misunderstanding\u2014perhaps expecting the same free service for non-district students. The user's response was reasonable given the circumstances. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for not tutoring the other student and charging for her time.\n"
