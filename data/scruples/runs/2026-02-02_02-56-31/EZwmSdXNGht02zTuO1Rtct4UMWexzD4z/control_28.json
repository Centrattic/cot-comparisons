The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the teacher offering free tutoring to her first-grade students after school, providing snacks, and then a parent from another school asks her to tutor their child as well. The teacher agrees but then finds out that the child is from a different county, which would make timing an issue. When the parent suggests a different time, the teacher offers to do it for $25, which leads to the parent getting angry and insulting her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the main points. The teacher is already volunteering her time and money (for snacks) for her own students. She's in a rural, low-income area, so the parent's child might not have access to other tutoring options. The teacher's offer to help was initially free, but when the parent's situation doesn't fit the existing schedule, she asks for compensation. The parent reacts negatively, thinking the teacher is selfish.\n\nThe key issues here are whether the teacher is obligated to provide free tutoring beyond her own students and whether charging for additional time is unreasonable. Since the teacher isn't supposed to charge her own students (due to conflict of interest), but this is a different child from another school, maybe the rules are different. However, the teacher is already giving her time for free with her own students, so expecting her to do more without compensation might be a stretch. On the other hand, the parent's child is in need, and the teacher was initially open to helping.\n\nThe parent's reaction seems extreme. The teacher isn't obligated to help, especially if it's causing personal strain (energy after work, helping her own son, driving time). Charging $25 is below the local rate, which is $30, so that's reasonable. The parent's accusations that the teacher is in it for money seem unfair because she was already giving free help. \n\nSo the teacher isn't in the wrong. She was willing to help beyond her duty but has limits. The parent is being unreasonable by expecting free services and reacting with hostility. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
