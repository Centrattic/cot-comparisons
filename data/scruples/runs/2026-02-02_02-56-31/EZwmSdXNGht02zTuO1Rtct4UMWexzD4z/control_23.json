The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not tutoring the student from another school.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for her own students, using her own time and money for snacks. That's commendable. Then a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who's in a different county and school. The timing doesn't work because the other school dismisses later. The parent then asks if the teacher can wait for the child to arrive later. The teacher says she's already exhausted by 4:15, has her own son to take care of, and driving home takes time. She offers to do it but for $25 per session. The parent gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of being selfish and only caring about money.\n\nNow, the key points here: The teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside her school or the existing commitments. She's already doing free tutoring, which is a big commitment. The parent is asking for a significant change in schedule and time. The teacher is asking for compensation because she's giving up her personal time, which is reasonable. The parent's reaction is clearly inappropriate and offensive.\n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. She's already helping her own students without payment. The parent's expectations might be unrealistic, expecting the teacher to take on extra work without any compensation. The teacher's right to ask for payment is valid since she's using her own time. The parent's harsh words are unjustified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
