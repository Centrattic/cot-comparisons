The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The situation involves the teacher offering free tutoring for their own students, but a parent from another school asks for tutoring. The teacher agrees to help but only if the child can make it on time. Since the other school ends later, the parent wants a separate session. The teacher then asks for $25 per session, which is under the local going rate. The parent gets angry and calls the teacher names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's responsibilities. The teacher is already providing free tutoring after school, which is a generous gesture, especially in a low-economic area. They're also paying for snacks themselves. The teacher's main job is with their own students, and they have personal responsibilities, like helping their own son with homework. It's reasonable for the teacher to have limits on their time and energy.\n\nThe parent's son is from a different county and school, so the teacher isn't obligated to help. The teacher offered to help but set a condition that the student could attend on time. When that's impossible, the parent wants a separate session. The teacher is working until 2:40 PM, and by 4:15 PM, they're likely too tired. Plus, the drive home takes 40 minutes, so getting home by 5:45 PM. The teacher is asking for compensation because they're using their personal time, which is fair. The parent's reaction is harsh, implying the teacher is selfish, but the teacher isn't required to help and is within their rights to say no, especially when it's outside their professional duties.\n\nAlso, the teacher's district policy might prohibit charging for tutoring their own students, but since this is a student from another school, maybe there are different rules. However, the teacher's main responsibility is to their own students, so it's reasonable to prioritize their time. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and asking for compensation for their time outside of work hours. The parent's anger seems unwarranted, and the teacher isn't obligated to help in this case. So the answer is B.\n"
