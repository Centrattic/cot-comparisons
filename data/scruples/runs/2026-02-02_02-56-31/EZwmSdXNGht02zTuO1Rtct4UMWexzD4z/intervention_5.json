  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is tutoring students from her own school for free, providing snacks and her own time. A parent from another district asks if she can tutor their child too, but there's a conflict with timing. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per hour, which is below the local rate. The parent gets angry and accuses her of not caring and being in it for money.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already giving her time and resources without expecting payment for her own students. She's in a rural, low-income area, so she's probably aware of the economic challenges. When the new parent asks for help, the time issue is a real problem because the other school ends later. The teacher offers a lower rate than the market rate, but the parent reacts negatively.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not obligated to tutor outside her job. She's already doing free tutoring for her own students, which is generous. The parent from another district is asking her to provide a service that's outside her current commitments. The teacher is asking for compensation, which is reasonable given the time and effort required. The parent's anger seems misplaced because the teacher is not required to volunteer her time, especially when it affects her own schedule and family responsibilities. The parent's accusations about caring for kids are unfair since the teacher is already helping others for free. So, I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
