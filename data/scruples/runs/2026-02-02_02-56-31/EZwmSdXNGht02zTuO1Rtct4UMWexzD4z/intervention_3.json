  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school for their own students, providing snacks they pay for themselves. A parent from another school contacts them about tutoring her son, who's in a different county and school. The user can't accommodate the timing because their own energy is low by 4:15 and they have commitments. They offer to tutor for $25 per session, which the parent reacts negatively to.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not helping and charging. First, the free tutoring is already a generous offer, especially since they can't charge for it due to conflict of interest policies. They're doing this out of their own time and money. The parent's child is in a different school, which complicates logistics. The user isn't obligated to tutor outside their school or district, especially with the timing issues. When the parent can't meet the initial schedule, the user considers charging, which is reasonable given the time and personal costs involved. The parent's hostile reaction seems unfair because the user is already overextending by offering the original free sessions. \n\nThe user isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They can't be expected to help beyond their capacity, especially when it's not their responsibility for another school's student. The fact that the parent is upset about compensation is a problem because the user isn't required to offer free services. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
