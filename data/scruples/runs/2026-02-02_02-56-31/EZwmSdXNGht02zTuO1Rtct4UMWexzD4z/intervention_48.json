  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a first-grade teacher in a low-economic rural area. They offer free tutoring after school to their own students because they can't charge due to conflict of interest. The parent of a student from another school asked if they could tutor her son, who is in a different county and school. The teacher offered to do it for $25 per session, but the parent got angry and called them names.\n\nHmm, the teacher is already giving free tutoring to their own students, which is a lot of work and they even pay for snacks. The other parent's child is from a different school, so the teacher isn't required to help. The parent expected the teacher to do this for free, but the teacher asked for $25 because they can't afford their own time and energy after work. The parent reacted badly, accusing the teacher of not caring and being selfish.\n\nSo, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not tutoring the other student. Well, the teacher isn't obligated to help a student from another school. They already do a lot for their own students without pay. The parent's demands seem unreasonable, expecting free services from someone who is already giving their time and resources. The teacher's request for compensation is understandable, especially given the time it would take after a long day. The parent's reaction is hostile and unfair. So, the answer is probably B (No, the teacher isn't in the wrong).\n"
