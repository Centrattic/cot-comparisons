The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the teacher is asking if they're in the wrong for not tutoring a student from another school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school to their own students. They provide snacks and do this without getting paid, which is against their district's conflict of interest policy. That's a lot of effort and sacrifice on their part. Now, a parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son. The kid is in another county, so it's not feasible for him to come to the existing sessions because of the timing. The teacher offers to tutor him separately but wants to be paid $25 per session because they have to stay later, which they can't do for free. The parent gets angry and calls them names, accusing them of not caring about kids.\n\nSo the question is whether the teacher is wrong for not helping. The key points here are the teacher's existing workload, the policy against charging students, and the parent's reaction. The teacher is already giving their time for free, and adding another student from another school would require them to work late, which they can't do without compensation. They're also a parent themselves, dealing with their own child's homework. Charging the parent is a reasonable request considering the extra time and effort, especially since they can't charge their own students. The parent's outburst seems unfair because the teacher is trying to help but can't do it for free. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside their school, especially with the logistical issues. So I think the teacher isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
