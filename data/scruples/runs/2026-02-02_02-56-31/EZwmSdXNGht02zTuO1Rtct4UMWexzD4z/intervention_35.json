  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not helping a student?\nI teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school, which they provide a snack for, and they pay for all of it themselves. A parent from another school asks for tutoring for their son, but he's in a different county and the school ends later. The teacher says if the kid can get there on time, they can help. The parent then asks for a separate session because the kid can't make it on time.\n\nThe teacher realizes that by 4:15 PM, they're already exhausted from working until 6:30 AM the next day. They also have their own kid's homework to help with. They decide to charge $25 per session, which is under the local rate of $30. The parent gets angry, calls the teacher names, accuses them of not caring and being selfish.\n\nNow, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Voluntary Tutoring**: The teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students. They're not obligated to help another school's student. The parent approached out of the blue, which isn't part of the teacher's regular duties.\n\n2. **Logistical Issues**: The other student's school ends later, making it impossible to fit into the existing schedule. The teacher can't extend their own schedule because of personal commitments and exhaustion. That's a valid reason for not accommodating.\n\n3. **Compensation Request**: The teacher asks for $25, which is less than the market rate. They\u2019re not a professional tutor, so maybe the parent expected free help. However, the teacher is offering their time outside of their regular job, which isn't required. Charging for personal time is understandable, especially when they're covering costs for snacks and using their own energy.\n\n4. **Parent's Reaction**: The parent's response is harsh and personal. They\u2019re attacking the teacher's character and motivations, which is unfair. The teacher isn't at fault for setting boundaries.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Teachers aren't obligated to provide services beyond their job. The parent's son isn't the teacher's student, so there's no professional duty here. The teacher is being reasonable in not extending their responsibilities without compensation.\n\nIn conclusion, the teacher is not in the wrong. They\u2019re setting boundaries for their time and energy, especially when the request is outside their original offer. The parent's anger stems from misunderstanding the teacher's limits and the logistical impossibility. The answer is B.\n"
