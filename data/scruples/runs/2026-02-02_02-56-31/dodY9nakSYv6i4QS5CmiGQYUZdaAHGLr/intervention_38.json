      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the parent is in the wrong for not giving the X-box gift card to their son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the kid is 14, got a gift card for Xbox for Christmas. The parent is holding onto it because the son is failing math. The reason for failing math is that he's spending all his free time on Fortnite instead of doing online homework. Other grades are dropping too because of this. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the parent's perspective. They want their son to focus on schoolwork. Since the son is neglecting homework, maybe taking away gaming privileges is a way to enforce responsibility. It's a common strategy for parents to use rewards and consequences. The X-box gift card is a privilege, so withholding it until the kid improves his behavior could be seen as a reasonable approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the son might feel that the parent is being too harsh. Maybe he's struggling with time management or the material in math. It's possible that the game isn't the root issue but a symptom. The parent might not be addressing the underlying problem, like the difficulty of the subject or the need for more structured help. Also, taking away something the kid received as a gift could be seen as punitive, but if it's framed as a condition for receiving it, maybe it's fair.\n\nAnother angle: the parent might have set clear expectations. Did they explain that the gift card is contingent on academic performance? If so, then following through could be consistent. If not, it might come off as arbitrary.\n\nAlso, the son's age. At 14, he's a teenager, so setting boundaries is important for teaching accountability. However, the parent should also consider open communication. Maybe there's a balance where the son gets limited access or has a schedule that allows gaming after completing homework. But the parent's approach here is more of a complete hold on the gift card until grades improve.\n\nPotential issues: If the parent is using punishment without providing support, like tutoring or help with time management, it might not be effective. The son might need more than just restrictions; he might need guidance. But the question is about whether the parent is in the wrong, not whether their approach is the best.\n\nIn terms of parental authority, parents do have the right to set rules and consequences. So from a traditional perspective, the parent isn't in the wrong. However, if the approach is unfair or not age-appropriate, some might argue otherwise. But given the information, the parent is taking a reasonable step to encourage responsibility.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, not in the wrong). They're enforcing accountability for academic responsibilities, which is a common parenting approach.\n"
