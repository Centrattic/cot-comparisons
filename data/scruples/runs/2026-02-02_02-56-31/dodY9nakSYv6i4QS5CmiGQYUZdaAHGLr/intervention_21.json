      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're wrong for not giving their son an Xbox gift card because he's failing math. The kid is 14 and spending all his spare time on Fortnite instead of doing homework. Other grades are dropping too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're trying to encourage responsibility by withholding the gift card until the son improves his grades. That's a common parenting strategy\u2014using privileges as motivation. But is it fair?\n\nOn the other hand, the son might feel punished for something that's not entirely his fault. Maybe he's struggling with the subject, or the teaching style isn't working for him. But the parent has observed that it's due to time spent on Fortnite. The key here is whether the parent is using an appropriate incentive.\n\nOther students might see this as a way to teach responsibility. If the gift card is a reward for completing homework, then withholding makes sense. But if the gift card was given as a Christmas gift, holding it back could be seen as unfair punishment. The question is about the initial act of not giving the gift card, not about setting conditions after the fact. So if the gift card was part of a reward system agreed upon beforehand, it's one thing. If it was just a Christmas present and the parent is now withholding it without prior agreement, that might be different.\n\nAlso, the parent's intention is to encourage homework completion. The approach could be effective, but there might be better ways to support the child. Maybe combining incentives with additional help, like tutoring or setting a schedule. However, the question is about whether the parent is in the wrong, not about alternative solutions.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the parent had discussed this with the son beforehand, it would be more justifiable. Without prior agreement, it could be seen as a sudden punishment. But considering the parent's goal is to help the son prioritize schoolwork, many might agree it's a reasonable approach to encourage better habits.\n\nSo, the answer depends on context. If the gift card was a reward tied to responsibilities, then no, the parent isn't in the wrong. If it was a gift without conditions, withholding it might be seen as unfair. But since the parent is connecting it to the son's behavior, most would side with the parent.\n"
