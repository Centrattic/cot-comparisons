It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. The friend was making a lot of insulting comments over two years, and the user finally snapped with a honest reply. Now mutual friends are saying the user is in the wrong, mentioning things like skinny privilege and entitlement. The user feels they worked hard and aren't privileged.\n\nHmm. First, I need to figure out if the user was justified. The friend was making personal, hurtful comments about the user's weight, job, and dating life. The user tried to brush it off but eventually responded with the truth about the friend's situation. The main issue is whether the user crossed a line.\n\nThe user's response pointed out the friend's situation as a reason for being single. While it's true that having multiple children from different fathers could be a challenge for potential partners, bringing it up in a personal way might be seen as cutting. Even if the user was tired of insults, responding with their own truth might not have been the best approach. It's possible that the user's comment was direct and hurtful, even if it was based on reality.\n\nAlso, mutual friends are criticizing the user, suggesting that the user's comment was harsh and not helpful. The user's friend might be in a tough spot, but the user's response could be seen as attacking her rather than supporting her. The user might not have considered the friend's feelings in the moment, even if they were frustrated.\n\nOn the other hand, the user was defensive after two years of insults. They tried to be polite but eventually stood up for themselves. The user's work in the adult industry and having an MBA might be sensitive topics, and the friend's insults could be undermining the user's achievements. However, the user's response might have been too direct without considering the friend's emotional state.\n\nSo, the key points are: the user was defending themselves after ongoing insults, but their response was a personal attack. Even if the comment was factual, the way it was delivered could be hurtful. The user might not be entirely in the wrong for standing up for themselves, but the method could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since mutual friends are siding with the friend and pointing out privilege, but the user did have a reason to be defensive, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the line is often drawn between standing up for oneself versus being unnecessarily harsh. The user's response was a direct accusation that could be seen as cutting. So, likely answer A: they are in the wrong.\n"
