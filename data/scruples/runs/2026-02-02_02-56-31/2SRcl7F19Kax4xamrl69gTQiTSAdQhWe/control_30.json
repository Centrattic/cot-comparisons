It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling her friend that her marital history with five kids from different fathers is why she's still single. \n\nFirst, the context: The friend has been making comments that the author sees as insulting. The friend's remarks are about the author's appearance, dating life, and job. The author has tried to brush them off. Then, after a lot of this, the author responds directly, pointing out the friend's situation. The friend reacts angrily and the mutual friends are criticizing the author.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was right to call out the friend. The key points here are about honesty in friendship, the appropriateness of the response, and whether the author crossed a line.\n\nThe author's response was based on a belief that the friend's situation (five kids with different fathers without child support) makes it hard to find someone. But even if that's true, the way it's delivered matters. The insults the friend made were personal and possibly hurtful, but the author's response was direct and maybe blunt. \n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often have to navigate sensitive topics. Even if the friend was making hurtful comments, responding with a direct critique of their personal life could be seen as attacking their issues rather than defending oneself. The author might have thought they were being honest, but it's possible that the approach was too harsh, especially if the friend's situation is a sensitive topic.\n\nAlso, mutual friends are saying the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled. The author argues against that, but others might see the response as a judgment that ignores the complexities of the friend's life. Even if the author's statement is factually true (that having multiple kids with different fathers can be a barrier), delivering it in the middle of a conflict might have been unkind or not helpful.\n\nThe author might have been better off setting boundaries without attacking the friend's personal history. Maybe saying something like, \"Your comments hurt me, and I can't keep engaging in this conversation.\" Instead, they chose to confront the root cause, which might have been valid but delivered in a way that's seen as cruel.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because the response, while possibly honest, was delivered in a confrontational way that escalated the conflict. Friends are supposed to be supportive, and even if the comments were hurtful, the response could have been more constructive. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
