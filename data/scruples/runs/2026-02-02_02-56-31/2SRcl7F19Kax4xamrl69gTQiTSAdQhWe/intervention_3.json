It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend the truth about her having five kids with different fathers. The friend was giving them insults for two years, so they finally responded with their honest opinion. Now mutual friends are saying the user is being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The user's friend was repeatedly making insulting comments, which the user tried to brush off with polite responses. But when pushed, they finally gave a direct answer. The key here is whether the response was appropriate.\n\nThe user's comment was that the friend's multiple children with different fathers might be why she can't get a partner. That's a factual statement, but it could come off as judgmental. Even if true, the way it's delivered matters. The user was defending their own choices and pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulties. However, the friend's issues might be more complex, and the user's comment might oversimplify or invalidate her struggles.\n\nAlso, mutual friends are saying the user has privilege and is entitled. The user mentions working hard, having an MBA, and working in the adult industry. But the friends might perceive the user as having an easier time, hence the privilege comment. The user feels they're not privileged, but the friends' reactions suggest they see it differently.\n\nThe user's friend has five children and no child support, which is a significant challenge. The user's response might have been honest but could have been delivered in a more supportive way. Instead of pointing out the problem, maybe offering support or resources would have been better. The user was tired of the insults, which is understandable, but responding with their own judgment might have escalated the situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The user had a right to set boundaries after being insulted, but their response might not have been the most constructive. The friend's behavior was also problematic, but the user's direct approach led to a fallout. There might be a better way to address it without being confrontational, like expressing concern without blaming.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user might not be entirely in the wrong for speaking their mind, but there could be alternative approaches. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong now. The answer might lean towards \"not in the wrong\" (B) but with the note that there could be a better way to handle it next time.\n"
