It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who's been divorced five times and has kids with different dads. She keeps asking the author questions that come off as insults. The author finally snaps and tells her that having five kids with different fathers might be why she's having trouble finding someone. The friend gets upset and hangs up. Now the mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author mentions they've been brushing off insults for two years. The friend's comments are not just questions but are phrased in a way that's clearly meant to belittle the author, touching on sensitive topics like body image, job status, and dating. The author is defending their own situation, which seems valid because the friend's behavior was persistent and hurtful.\n\nWhen the author finally responds about the five kids, it's a direct point about the friend's situation. The friend's behavior might be rooted in her own insecurities or issues, and the author is pointing out a likely reason for her struggles. But the question is whether the author's response was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves against constant insults and was honest about their assessment of the friend's situation. They might feel that they were just telling the truth and setting boundaries. On the other hand, bringing up something as sensitive as the friend's past and current circumstances could be seen as harsh, even if true. The friend might feel that her personal struggles were dismissed or judged.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that they view the author's response as hurtful or privileged. The author argues that they're not entitled and have worked hard, but maybe the friends feel the author didn't consider the friend's feelings. The key here is whether the author's response crossed a line, even if the friend was being insincere.\n\nAlternative responses the author could have used might include setting boundaries without being critical of the friend's situation. For example, explaining that everyone's circumstances are different or redirecting the conversation to the friend's own actions. However, the author felt they were being truthful and that the friend needed to hear it.\n\nIn terms of accountability, while the friend was in the wrong for the constant insults, the author's direct approach might have come across as judgmental. The line between honesty and being hurtful can be thin. The author might not be entirely in the wrong given the context of enduring two years of insults, but their response could have been more empathetic. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not just whether they could have handled it better.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's response was a reaction to ongoing negative behavior. While the delivery might not have been perfect, the core message was based on an observation that could be relevant. The mutual friends' reactions are more about privilege, which might not be directly applicable here. The author was defending their own experiences and pointing out a factual aspect of the friend's life that could impact her dating situation. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
