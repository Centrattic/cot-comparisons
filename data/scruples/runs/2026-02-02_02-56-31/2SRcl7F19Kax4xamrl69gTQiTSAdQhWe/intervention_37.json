It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend about her situation regarding having five kids with different fathers and not getting dates. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend has been making hurtful comments towards the user for two years. The user kept brushing them off, giving supportive responses. Then, when the friend kept asking why she's not getting dates, the user pointed out the obvious reason related to her five kids from different dads and no child support. The friend got upset and hung up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the user, saying they're privileged and that the friend isn't going through that much. The user feels wronged and worked hard for their success.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is whether the user was right to confront their friend in that way. The user's response was factual but could have been hurtful. The friend's behavior was rude and insincere, but the user's response might have been too direct or harsh, even if true. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that they didn't see the user's side, possibly due to lack of understanding or different perspectives on privilege and work ethic.\n\nThe user's situation is complex. They've been trying to be a good friend by not lashing out initially. But when pushed, they gave a truthful answer that the friend might not have wanted to hear. However, the way it was delivered might have come across as judgmental. Even if the user's intent was to help, the friend might feel shamed or blamed. The user might not be in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently. The key is whether the response was necessary and how it was delivered. The user's own work ethic and challenges are personal, but the friend's situation might have different complexities that the user isn't considering. So, while the user's intent was to be honest, the method and timing might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is a bit nuanced, but leaning towards B, not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they communicated.\n"
