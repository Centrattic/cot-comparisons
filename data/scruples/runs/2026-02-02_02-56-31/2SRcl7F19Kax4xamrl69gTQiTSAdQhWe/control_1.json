It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple kids by different fathers are making it hard for her to find a partner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making a lot of comments that are insulting to the author. The author has been trying to brush them off, but finally, after a lot of these comments, the author responds by pointing out the friend's situation. The friend then gets upset and hangs up. Now mutual friends are saying the author is wrong, but the author feels they're being unfairly judged and that they're not privileged.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's behavior, the author's response, and the reactions from mutual friends. Let's break it down.\n\nThe friend's comments are personal and seem to be making digs at the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author has been defending themselves with advice like \"focus on yourself\" but eventually calls out the friend's situation. The author's point is that the friend's history of multiple children with different fathers might be a barrier for potential partners. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author's response was wrong. On one hand, the friend was being insulting, so the author might feel justified in pointing out the truth. On the other hand, bringing up someone's personal life, especially something sensitive like having multiple children, could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe author's response was honest, but maybe it's not the best way to handle the situation. Even if the friend's behavior is annoying, responding with a direct critique of her personal choices might not be helpful. It could be perceived as shaming or judgmental, which might not be the right approach, especially if the author's goal was to help the friend see her own issues rather than just attack the author.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's statement might have been hurtful. They mention skinny privilege and entitlement, which could indicate that the author's comments weren't well-received and perhaps came across as condescending. The author argues they're not privileged, but the friends believe otherwise. \n\nAnother angle: the author has their own challenges\u2014working in a stigmatized industry, being a single parent, etc. But the response chosen was to directly address the friend's situation, which might not have been the most supportive way. Maybe there's a better approach, like setting boundaries or not engaging in the insults, rather than retaliating.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because even though the friend was being rude, responding with a personal attack might not be the appropriate way to handle it. It could be seen as unkind and potentially shaming, which might not help the friend's situation. The author might have been better off not engaging with the insults or addressing the behavior without making it personal. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
