It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's having trouble finding a partner. The friend had been making hurtful comments for two years, and the user finally responded with the truth as they saw it. Now mutual friends are criticizing them for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics of the friendship. The user's friend has been making personal attacks, which the user tried to brush off for a long time. The user's response was a factual statement pointing out a possible reason for the friend's difficulties. The friend reacted negatively, and now mutual friends are taking her side, suggesting the user was wrong.\n\nThe user's defense is that they weren't being privileged, but had worked hard. The question is whether the user's response was justified or if they overstepped. In situations like this, it's often about the approach. Even if the truth is valid, the way it's delivered can affect how it's received. The user's friend had been asking for advice, so the user's answer might have been seen as honest but harsh. However, the friend's repeated insults might have made the user feel they were being attacked, so pointing out the obvious could be seen as self-defense.\n\nOn the other hand, mutual friends are pointing out that the user might not understand the friend's struggles, which could imply that the user's comment was insensitive. The user mentions that the friend had tried the same job, so maybe there's a comparison there. However, the user's comment about the five kids is a direct hit on the friend's personal life, which could be perceived as judgmental regardless of the truth.\n\nThe key here is whether the user's response was constructive or just a personal attack. Saying that someone's situation is causing their problems can come off as blaming the victim, even if it's true. The user might have intended to be honest, but the way it was said might have been unkind. Also, the user was defending themselves against insults, but the mutual friends are taking the friend's side, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of social norms, calling out a friend's personal life in a direct manner can be seen as crossing a line, even if the other person was being insulting. People often expect a certain level of tact and empathy, especially in a friendship. The user's response might be seen as honest but lacking in compassion. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not handling it more delicately and for making a personal comment that could be seen as insensitive despite the friend's behavior.\n"
