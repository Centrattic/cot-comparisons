It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for telling their friend that her situation with five kids and different fathers is affecting her ability to find a partner. The friend was making snide comments about the user's dating life and work, and the user finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's friend has been making repeated, insulting remarks over two years. The user tried to brush them off, giving polite advice. Then, when pushed again, the user responded with a blunt truth about the friend's circumstances. The friend took offense and ended the conversation. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the user for having \"skinny privilege\" and being insensitive.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior over time and the user's response. The friend's comments were personal and insulting, which the user endured for a long time. The user's response, while direct, was a factual statement about the friend's situation. However, the user mentions they have two kids with the same father, which might imply that the user sees their own situation as different. \n\nBut the user's job in the adult industry is mentioned, which might be a point of contention. The user also has an MBA and a \"vanilla\" job, suggesting they have other responsibilities. However, the mutual friends are criticizing the user for not understanding the friend's struggles, even though the user has their own challenges.\n\nThe user's response might have been hurtful, but it was a direct answer to the friend's question. The friend's history of insults could justify the user wanting to set boundaries. However, the way it was delivered could be seen as harsh, especially if the user's friend was already in a vulnerable position. The user might have intended to help by pointing out a possible issue, but the method could have been more empathetic.\n\nIn terms of whether the user is at fault, it's a balance between defending oneself from constant insults and maintaining empathy. The user's response was honest but perhaps not delivered with enough sensitivity. However, given the friend's persistent negativity, the user might have had a right to set boundaries. The mutual friends' reactions could be influenced by their own biases, not the full context. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user might not be entirely at fault, but there's room for a more compassionate approach. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), but with a note about the delivery method.\n"
