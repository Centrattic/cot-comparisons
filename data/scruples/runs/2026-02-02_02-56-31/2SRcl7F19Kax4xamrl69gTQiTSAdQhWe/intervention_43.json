It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status is due to having five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making hurtful comments for two years, and the user finally responded with the truth they believed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's friend has a history of making personal and insulting remarks, which the user tried to brush off. When the friend asked again, the user answered honestly, pointing out her situation. The friend reacted angrily and hung up. Now mutual friends are saying the user is privileged and in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user's response was an appropriate way to handle the situation. The user is defensive, feeling they were just being honest after enduring insults. They also mention their own work ethic and challenges, contrasting with their friend's situation.\n\nI should think about the dynamics of the friendship. The user tried to defuse the insults before, but when the friend kept pushing, they finally responded with the truth. However, the way they delivered the truth might have been harsh. Even if the friend was rude, the user's response was a direct accusation about her personal life. That might have crossed a line.\n\nAlso, mutual friends are reacting negatively, suggesting that the user's comment wasn't supportive. Friends might feel it was unkind to point out her situation even if it's true. The user's friend might be struggling with self-esteem issues, and the user's response could have been hurtful, even if well-intentioned.\n\nBut the user did mention that they were tired of the insults and were finally speaking their mind. The question is whether the response was justified. It's possible that while the user had valid reasons to be upset, the way they expressed it wasn't constructive. Maybe there was a better way to address the friend's behavior without attacking her directly.\n\nIn terms of the user's own situation, they have their own challenges and different circumstances. However, the key issue is how they handled the conflict. Even if the friend was being insulting, the user's response could be seen as cutting, especially in a close friendship. Mutual friends' reactions indicate that the user might have overstepped, and perhaps they're in the wrong for not handling it more delicately.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards \"Yes, you're in the wrong\" because of the direct and possibly hurtful response, even if the user was defending themselves against insults.\n"
