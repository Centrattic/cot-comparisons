It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault (AITA) for telling their friend that her situation with having five kids by different fathers is why she's single. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The friend has been making a lot of comments over two years that the author finds insulting. The friend's remarks are not just about the author's dating life but also touch on personal aspects like her job and body image. The author tried to brush them off with vague responses but finally snapped and gave a direct answer pointing out the friend's history with child support and the challenges that brings.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the friend's behavior and the author's response. The friend was persistently making hurtful comments, even after the author tried to deflect them. The author's response was direct, pointing out a factual aspect of the friend's life that could be a barrier to finding a partner. But was that crossing a line?\n\nIn terms of friendship dynamics, friends don't usually confront each other with such blunt truths, especially when it's a sensitive topic like multiple divorces and child support. The author's comment, while possibly true, might be perceived as judgmental and harsh, especially after a long period of passive-aggressive remarks. Even if the friend was being insulting, the author's response might have been too direct and could have been seen as attacking the friend's personal choices rather than addressing the insults constructively.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was not well-received. They mentioned \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement, which might indicate that the author's response was seen as insensitive or not considering the friend's circumstances. The author argues that they worked hard and aren't entitled, but the friends' reactions might reflect a perception of the author's response as dismissive or judgmental.\n\nHowever, the friend had been making continuous, low-quality insults, and the author felt justified in responding with the truth. The line between standing up for oneself and being too harsh can be blurry. The author's intention was to be honest, but the delivery might have been too blunt, especially without considering the emotional impact on the friend.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a right to feel wronged by the friend's insults, the response might have been too direct and could have been delivered more compassionately. The key is whether the truth was said in a way that was constructive or just hurtful. Given the outcome (the friend being furious and mutual friends siding against the author), it seems that the author's approach, while perhaps truthful, was not the most tactful. Therefore, the author might be considered at fault for not handling the situation more delicately.\n"
