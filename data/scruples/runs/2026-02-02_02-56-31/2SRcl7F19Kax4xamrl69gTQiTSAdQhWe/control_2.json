It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers and none of the dads pay support. The friend had been making a lot of insults towards the author for two years, and finally, the author snapped and gave a honest reply.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend is single, has five kids with different fathers, no child support. The author is in a similar situation as a mother of two with the same dad, but works in the adult industry and has an MBA. The author was being insulted by the friend for two years, and when the friend kept badgering her with questions, the author responded with the truth about the friend's situation causing her difficulty in finding a partner. The friend got angry and hung up. Now mutual friends are saying the author is in the wrong, talking about privilege and entitlement.\n\nSo the core issue is whether the author's response was justified given the prior context. The author felt belittled and insulted, so when the friend asked again, they gave a truthful but blunt answer. The question is about the rightness of that response.\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves after being insulted. They might believe they had the right to point out the obvious reason the friend is struggling. The author's response was honest and based on the friend's own situation. But on the other hand, even if the friend was being rude, was it appropriate to call out her situation directly, especially in a way that might be seen as judgmental or hurtful?\n\nThe key factors here are the history of insults and the nature of the response. The author had been putting up with two years of insults, which were personal and possibly low-quality. When the friend asked again, the author gave a truthful but potentially hurtful response. The mutual friends are now criticizing the author, saying they're being entitled. However, the author's job and situation are different from the friend's, but they might feel they've worked hard for their success.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. While the friend was being rude, responding with a direct critique of the friend's life choices could be seen as crossing a line. Even if true, it might not be the right way to address it. The author might have been justified in wanting to stop the insults by addressing the root cause, but the method could be problematic. Alternatively, maybe there was a better way to respond without being so blunt, but given the two-year history, the author might feel justified in finally speaking up.\n\nSo the question is whether the author's response was in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then the author is in the wrong. If B (no), then they're not. Considering that the author was responding to two years of insults and gave a truthful answer, but in a way that might be seen as hurtful, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was not well-received. But the initial context of ongoing insults might mitigate the author's wrongness. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author was responding to a history of insults and gave a honest answer, but it's possible that the way they delivered it was unkind. However, the key is whether the content of the response was wrong. The author's statement was factual, pointing out a real issue the friend has. However, the delivery might have been harsh. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if the content is true, maybe it's not wrong. But maybe the author should have handled it differently. Alternatively, the author's response was a direct answer to the friend's question, so it's not wrong. \n\nWait, the friend asked \"why can't I get anyone?\" and the author answered with the truth. So the author isn't lying. However, the way they said it might be perceived as harsh. But the author was tired of insults, so their response was a form of self-defense. In that case, maybe they're not in the wrong. But some might argue that even in self-defense, the response was too harsh. The mutual friends think the author is privileged, but the author argues they worked hard. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they answered truthfully after enduring two years of insults. However, others might still think it's unkind. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they should have handled it better. If the author's statement is factually true, then maybe not wrong. But if it's a judgmental comment, then maybe yes. The line between truth and judgment can be blurry. The author's statement is a judgment that the friend's situation makes it hard to find a partner, which might be a valid observation, but it's also a sensitive topic. So it's a close call. I think the answer is B (No).\n"
