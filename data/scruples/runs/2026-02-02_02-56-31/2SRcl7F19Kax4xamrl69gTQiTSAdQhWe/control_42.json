It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a friend who's had a conversation with another friend who's been going through a lot with five kids from different fathers and is now divorced. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author's weight, dating life, and job. The author tried to brush it off for two years but finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation as the reason she's having trouble finding someone. The friend got angry, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, the author's friend has been making personal and possibly hurtful comments. The author felt insulted and tired of it. The response the author gave was about the friend's situation\u2014five kids with different dads and no child support. The author thought this was the truth and a valid reason why someone might be hesitant to date her.\n\nBut the mutual friends are saying the author is wrong, pointing to \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement. The author argues that they've worked hard for their achievements.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are whether the author's response was appropriate given the context. The author was defending themselves after two years of being insulted. However, bringing up such a personal and sensitive issue about someone else's family might be seen as crossing a line, even if it's the truth. The friend's actions (five different fathers) could indeed make it harder to find a partner, but pointing that out in the heat of the moment might come off as judgmental or harsh, especially if the friend is already vulnerable.\n\nThe author might have thought they were giving honest feedback, but the way it was delivered could be seen as attacking the friend's personal life rather than addressing the insults directly. The friend's response (insult fury and hanging up) suggests that the comment was hurtful. The mutual friends' reactions also indicate that the community perceives the author's response as unkind or insensitive.\n\nHowever, considering that the author was being insulted repeatedly and finally stood up for themselves, there's a case to be made that they had a right to respond. The challenge is whether the author could have addressed the friend's behavior in a more constructive way without being judgmental about her personal choices.\n\nAlternative responses could have been to set boundaries about not engaging in the insults or discussing the friend's dating life in a supportive way. But the author chose to directly address the issue by pointing out the friend's situation, which might not be the best approach in a friendship where the friend is already feeling vulnerable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent was to stop the insults and give honest feedback, the method of doing so by highlighting a sensitive personal matter might have been unkind and contributed to the fallout. So, the author might be in the wrong for how they responded, even if their intention was to help.\n"
