It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend about her having five kids with different fathers is in the wrong. The friend was making a lot of insults over two years, and the author finally snapped. The friend is now upset and the mutual friends are taking her side, saying the author had \"skinny privilege\" and was entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made repeated insults over two years, which the author tried to brush off. The insults were personal and hurtful, targeting the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation as the reason for her problems. The question is whether that response was justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. On one hand, people have the right to express their opinions, even if they're blunt. The author was defending themselves after enduring years of insults. They didn't just attack without cause; they had a history of being mocked. But on the other hand, pointing out someone's personal choices, especially when they're sensitive, can be hurtful. The author's response might have been a direct truth, but it's possible that it came off as judgmental or harsh, especially if delivered in a confrontational way.\n\nThe friends are reacting by saying the author is privileged and the friend isn't going through much. But the author argues they've worked hard. However, the focus here is on the confrontation. The key points are the long history of insults and the author's response. Was the author's reply a fair retort or an overreaction?\n\nIn many social situations, honesty isn't always the best policy if it's delivered in a way that's unkind. The author might have thought they were being honest, but if the friend was already in a vulnerable place, the response could have been more damaging. Also, the friend's own actions (five kids with different fathers) might be a sensitive topic, and bringing it up could be seen as crossing a line, even if it's true.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that the social circle found the author's response inappropriate. But the question is whether the author is actually in the wrong. If the author was defending themselves after being insulted, maybe there's some justification. However, the method might have been too harsh. Maybe there was a better way to respond without being so direct.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the friend was being insulting, the author's response might have been too harsh and brought up a sensitive issue in a way that was hurtful. Friendships require tact, and while the author had reasons, the way they responded could have been more constructive. However, there's also the argument that the author was defending themselves. But given the mutual friends' reactions and the potential for the response to be seen as judgmental, the answer leans towards A.\n"
