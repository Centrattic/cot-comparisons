It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user's friend has a history of five marriages and five kids with different fathers, none of whom pay child support. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the user for two years, and the user finally called her out on her situation, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior included personal attacks, implying that the user's success in relationships is due to being skinny, suggesting that the user is only getting dates by being a \"basic blonde,\" and making comments about sex. The user tried to brush these off but eventually responded with the truth about the friend's situation. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user was wrong to point out the friend's circumstances. The user's comment was about the friend's five children with different fathers and the lack of child support, which could make it hard for someone to commit. The user's intention was to be honest, but the friend took it as an insult and ended the conversation.\n\nOn one hand, the user had been defending themselves against persistent insults. It's possible that the user felt cornered and finally responded with a truthful but blunt comment. The user might have thought that addressing the root of the friend's issues was necessary, even if it was harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the comment was true, delivering it in a direct and critical manner could be seen as insensitive. Friends are supposed to support each other, and pointing out someone's flaws in a judgmental way can damage the relationship. The user's remarks might have been perceived as shaming, which isn't constructive. Additionally, the user's work in the adult industry and the friend's own attempts to do the same might add another layer of complexity, but that's not directly related to the main issue here.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that the user's comment was hurtful and not supportive. They mentioned terms like \"privilege\" and \"entitled,\" which indicates that the user's response might come off as dismissive of the friend's struggles, even if the user feels they are not privileged. The user's hard work and achievements might be real, but the way they responded could have been perceived as judgmental rather than empathetic.\n\nIs there a better way to have handled it? Maybe addressing the friend's issues without being critical, perhaps with empathy and support. For example, acknowledging the friend's challenges without shaming her. However, the user had been dealing with two years of insults, so it's understandable that they might have snapped.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But in friendships, how you communicate the truth matters. Even if the statement was factually true, the delivery and context might have been inappropriate. The user's response might be seen as crossing a line from honesty to shaming, leading to the friend's anger and the mutual friends' criticism. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for the way they communicated the truth, even if their intention was to be honest."
