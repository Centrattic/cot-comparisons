It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their friend has five kids with different fathers and is single, and she's been making comments to the person that come off as insulting. The person tried to brush off the insults but finally snapped, pointing out their friend's situation as the reason she's having trouble finding a partner. Now, mutual friends are saying the person was wrong and that they have something like \"skinny privilege\" or are entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend's comments were personal and seemed to be comparisons meant to undermine the person. The person responded by pointing out the friend's situation, which led to a fallout. The mutual friends are taking the friend's side, accusing the person of being judgmental or privileged.\n\nI should consider the context. The friend had a history of making hurtful comments over two years, and the person was defending themselves. But maybe the response was too direct or hurtful? The person's statement about the five kids and no child support might have been a sensitive topic for the friend. Even if it's true, bringing it up in a confrontational way could be seen as attacking her rather than offering support.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are saying the person is privileged. The person works in the adult industry but also has an MBA and a \"vanilla job.\" They have two kids with the same dad. The friend has five kids with different fathers. So, maybe the friends see the person as having an easy time, but the person feels they've worked hard. However, the friend's situation is also complicated, and the person's response might have come off as judgmental regardless of their own struggles.\n\nThe question is about whether the person was in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of advice, when friends are making repeated negative or insulting comments, it's important to set boundaries. However, the way the person chose to respond might not have been the best approach. Instead of pointing out the friend's situation directly, perhaps a more empathetic approach or redirecting the conversation could have been better. But the person was tired of the insults and finally stood up for themselves. \n\nIn terms of social norms, calling someone out on their personal choices, especially in a sensitive area like relationships and parenting, can be seen as crossing a line, even if the comments are true. The mutual friends might feel that the person was being unkind and judgmental rather than supportive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person might be seen as having overstepped by bringing up the friend's personal issues in a way that could be perceived as attacking her, even if the friend was being rude. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes in the wrong). However, there's also an argument that the person was defending themselves after years of insults, so maybe B (no). But given the friends' reactions and the context of the situation, the more socially acceptable approach might be to say A. But I'm not sure. Maybe there's a middle ground here. The person had a right to set a boundary, but the method could have been better. So maybe they are somewhat in the wrong, but not entirely. However, the question is binary. Given that, I think the answer is A because the response was direct and possibly hurtful, even if justified.\n"
