It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids by different fathers without child support. The friend was already giving the author a hard time with insults about her weight, job, and dating life for two years. The author finally snapped and called out the friend's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend's behavior was ongoing and hurtful, with personal and sometimes untrue comments directed at the author. The author tried to brush them off initially but decided to respond with the truth after a long period of being insulted. The author's response was pointing out a factual reason the friend might be struggling to find a partner. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the context of the insults and the author's response. The friend's behavior wasn't just a one-time thing; it was a two-year pattern. The author's response, while direct, was a truthful observation based on the situation. However, even if the statement is true, the delivery and the appropriateness matter. The friend was already sensitive and might not have wanted to hear that critique. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are reacting by blaming the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. That adds another layer where the author feels misunderstood. The author's response could have been more empathetic. Instead of directly blaming the friend's kids as the reason for her being single, maybe suggesting ways she could improve her situation or offering support would have been better. \n\nBut considering the two years of insults and the fact that the author was finally defending themselves, the situation is a bit of a gray area. The author's statement is true and relevant, but the way it was delivered might have been harsh. However, since the friend was the one starting the conflict, the author might not be entirely at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, even in self-defense, attacking another person's situation can be seen as crossing a line. The author could have chosen a more constructive approach. So, while the friend's behavior was worse, the author's response might still be considered inappropriate because it was a personal attack rather than a supportive response.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they responded with a personal attack despite the context. However, there's a strong argument that the friend's prior behavior justified the response. But in terms of what's socially acceptable, the author's statement was a direct blame and might be seen as hurtful regardless of the context. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
