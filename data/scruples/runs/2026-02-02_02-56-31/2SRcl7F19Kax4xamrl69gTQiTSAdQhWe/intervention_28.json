It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the person is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids from different fathers is making it hard for her to find a partner. The friend was being insulting for two years, and the person finally snapped with the truth. Now, mutual friends are saying the person was wrong and that they have \"skinny privilege\" or are entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend was making personal attacks for a long time, which the person ignored. But when the friend continued to ask the same questions in a hurtful way, the person responded with the honest reason they thought was affecting the friend's dating life. The friend then reacted angrily and hung up. \n\nNow, mutual friends are criticizing the person for being insensitive. The person feels they were just being honest and that the friend's behavior was the issue. They also mention their own work ethic and challenges, which might be part of why they feel defensive.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend was being insulting for two years, the person finally spoke up with a truthful but potentially hurtful response, and now there's backlash from mutual friends. The person's intention was to stop the insults and offer a genuine perspective, but the delivery might have been harsh. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's possible that while the friend's behavior was problematic, the person's response, though honest, might have been too direct and could have been phrased more compassionately. Even if the friend was being mean, responding with a blunt truth without considering the emotional impact could come off as cutting. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the community might have different standards for what's acceptable to say, even in the context of a strained friendship. The person might have crossed a line by bringing up the friend's personal situation, which is sensitive and could be seen as a low blow despite the prior insults. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, even though the friend was being difficult, the person's response might not have been the best approach. They could have maintained their boundaries without being hurtful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards \"Yes, I am in the wrong\" because the response, while honest, was likely unkind and didn't consider the friend's feelings, even if the friend was being insulting. However, if the friend was being aggressive, the person might have a case for defending themselves, but the method could have been better. But given the mutual friends' reactions, there's a chance the person did overstep.\n"
