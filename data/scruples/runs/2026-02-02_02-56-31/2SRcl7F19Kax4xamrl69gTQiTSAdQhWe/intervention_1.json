It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers are making it hard for her to find dates. The friend had been making hurtful comments for two years, and the user finally responded with what they saw as the truth. Now mutual friends are criticizing the user, saying they're privileged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making repeated, insulting remarks about the user's weight, job, and dating life. The user tried to brush them off with generic advice. Then, when the friend asked why she can't find dates, the user pointed out the friend's situation as a possible reason. \n\nThe key here is whether the user's response was a valid and appropriate reaction. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful and persistent. The user's response was a direct address of the friend's situation, which might be a legitimate factor in finding a partner. However, the user's delivery might have come off as harsh, especially since the friend was already defensive. \n\nAlso, mutual friends are siding with the friend, suggesting the user had it easier, which adds social pressure. But the user argues they worked hard and aren't privileged. The friend's actions were the root issue here, with the insults being the catalyst. \n\nIn such situations, it's important to consider if there was a better way to approach the conversation, perhaps with more empathy. However, the user was reacting to two years of insults. The question is whether the truth was a valid response or crossing a line. \n\nGiven that the user was defending themselves against ongoing attacks, pointing out a potential reason might be justified, but the manner could have been more compassionate. However, the friend's reaction was extreme. So, the answer might be that the user isn't entirely in the wrong but could have handled it better. However, since the question is a yes/no, the user was in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nConsidering the context and the provocation, the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong), as the user was responding to ongoing insults and trying to be honest about a possible reason. The friends' reactions might be biased. However, the user could have approached it with more care. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the best approach. So, the answer is B.\n"
