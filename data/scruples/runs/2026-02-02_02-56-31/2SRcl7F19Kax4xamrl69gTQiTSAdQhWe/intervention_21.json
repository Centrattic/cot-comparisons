It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they were at fault for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers might be affecting her ability to find a partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making repeated, insulting comments about the user's weight, dating life, and job. The user, who has two kids with the same dad and a stable arrangement, has been brushing off these insults. Finally, when the friend asks why she can't find dates, the user responds by pointing out her situation with five kids and no child support. The friend gets upset and hangs up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the user, saying they used \"skinny privilege\" and are being a bad friend.\n\nSo, the key points are: Was the user justified in responding with the truth, even if it was blunt? Did they cross a line by calling out their friend's choices, even if it's a valid point? The user is defensive about their own life and feels their friend's comments were untrue and low-quality. The friend's behavior seems to be more about her own insecurities and projecting them onto the user.\n\nThe user's response, while honest, might come off as judgmental. Even if the statement is factually true, delivering it in a way that could be seen as shaming might not be the best approach. Friends are supposed to support each other, not add to the pressure. However, the user was tired of being insulted and felt they were just pointing out a reality that their friend wasn't considering.\n\nMutual friends are now taking sides, suggesting the user is privileged, but the user argues they've worked hard. The friend's situation with five kids and child support issues is indeed challenging, but the user's friend's approach of making hurtful comments versus constructive support is questionable.\n\nIn terms of whether the user is in the wrong, it's a tough call. They might not be entirely wrong since the friend was being rude first. But the way they responded could have been more empathetic. Maybe a better approach would have been to address the friend's behavior without judgment, offering support instead of criticism. So, while the user might not be entirely at fault, their method of addressing the issue could have been improved.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nWhile your friend's behavior was hurtful and dismissive, your response\u2014though truthful\u2014could have been delivered with more empathy. Directly pointing out her situation in a way that felt judgmental may have crossed a line, especially given the ongoing insults. A better approach might have been to address the disrespectful dynamic without shaming her choices, while protecting your own boundaries. Mutual friends' reactions highlight the sensitivity around how such truths are framed.",
