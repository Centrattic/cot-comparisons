It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the friend has been making insults towards the author for two years, about her weight, job, and dating life. The author has been brushing them off, giving generic advice. Then, when the friend asks again, the author responds honestly about the friend's situation with the kids and child support. This causes the friend to get angry and hang up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying she has privilege and was wrong to say that.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014making personal, insulting comments repeatedly. The author was defending themselves after enduring this for two years. But when the author called out the friend's situation, it might have come across as judgmental, even if it's true that having multiple children with different fathers can make it hard to find a partner. The friend's response was emotional, but maybe the author's truth-telling was too direct or harsh.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are siding with the friend, saying the author is privileged. The author mentions they work hard and have an MBA, but maybe others perceive them as having an easier time. However, the friend's issues with relationships and child support are real and complicated. The author's comment, while truthful, might have been insensitive or not considerate of the friend's feelings, even if the friend was being rude. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, even if someone is being mean, calling them out in a harsh way can escalate the situation. The author might have needed a different approach, like setting boundaries without attacking the friend's choices. But was it wrong? It's possible the author was within their right to speak their mind after being insulted, but the method could have been better. However, the friend's behavior was also clearly problematic. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for speaking their truth, but the way they did it could have been more empathetic. However, the friend's actions were also wrong. The key is whether the author's response was an appropriate reaction to ongoing insults. Since the friend was the one initiating the insults, the author might be justified in pushing back. But the comment about child support could be seen as a personal attack, even if it's a valid point. \n\nI think the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They were defending themselves after being insulted and giving advice that's grounded in reality. However, there could be a better way to phrase it without causing offense, but that doesn't mean they were wrong to say it. The friend's actions were more in the wrong here for the ongoing insults.\n"
