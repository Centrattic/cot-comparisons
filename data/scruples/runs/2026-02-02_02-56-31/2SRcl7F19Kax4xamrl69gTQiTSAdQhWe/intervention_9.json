It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who has five children with different fathers and is now single. The user's friend has been making hurtful comments about her, and the user finally snaps by pointing out her situation as the reason she can't find a partner. Now, the mutual friends are upset with the user, saying they're being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The user mentions that their friend has been making insults for two years. The user tried to brush them off with generic advice, but when pushed, they gave a direct answer about the friend's situation. The friend then reacted negatively, and now the user is being criticized.\n\nThe key points here are the content of the response and the context. The user's statement, \"You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure,\" is a direct critique of the friend's personal life. Even if true, the way it's delivered could be seen as judgmental and hurtful, especially given the ongoing insults. It's possible that the user was tired of the friend's comments and finally snapped, but in doing so, they turned the conversation back on the friend's issues, which the friend might find harsh.\n\nNow, considering the mutual friends' reactions. They say the user has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled. The user argues that they've worked hard and aren't privileged. This adds another layer\u2014personal beliefs about their own circumstances versus others' perceptions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the user's response was appropriate. While the user was defending themselves from years of insults, the response might have crossed a line by being a direct attack on the friend's personal choices and situation, even if it's a valid observation. Friends might expect support rather than such pointed criticism. Additionally, the user's friend's reaction (angry and hanging up) suggests that the response was hurtful.\n\nHowever, the user was responding to ongoing harassment and tried to deflect for two years. It's possible they felt they had a valid reason to speak up, especially if they believe their friend's situation is contributing to her difficulties. But in a friendship, the manner and delivery matter. The user might not be entirely at fault, but their response could be seen as tactless. There might have been a better way to address the issue without making it personal.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be a bit nuanced. But since the question is binary (A or B), I need to choose between the user being in the wrong or not. Given that the user was reacting to years of insults and tried to address the root cause, but the method was harsh, it's a close call. However, in social dynamics, even if the truth is spoken, the delivery and intent matter. So the user might be partially at fault for not handling it more sensitively. Alternatively, they might not be at fault for finally standing up for themselves. But given the mutual friends' reactions and the potential for the comment to be seen as judgmental, leaning towards the user being in the wrong (A) might be the case. However, if the friend was truly being insufferable, the user's response could be seen as justified. It's tricky, but I think the answer is A because the user's response was a direct criticism that might have been unnecessarily harsh, even if true.\n"
