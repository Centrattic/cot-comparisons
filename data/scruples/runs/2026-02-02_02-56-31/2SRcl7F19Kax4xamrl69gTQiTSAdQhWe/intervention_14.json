It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is affecting her dating life. The friend was being insulting and passive-aggressive for two years, and the user snapped by pointing out what they see as the real issue.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior: she's been making hurtful comments for two years. The user tried to brush them off with polite responses. The final straw was when the friend accused the user of having a \"real job\" and other things, leading the user to respond honestly. The user's point is that the friend's situation (multiple kids by different fathers without child support) makes it hard for someone to commit. \n\nNow, the user is facing backlash from mutual friends who think the user is privileged and the friend isn't going through anything major. The user feels they're being judged unfairly and that their own struggles (like working in the adult industry, having an MBA, managing kids) are not acknowledged.\n\nThe key here is whether the user's response was justified. The friend was being insulting, so the user had a reason to push back. However, the response was specific to the friend's situation, which is a sensitive topic. The user's answer might have been the truth but could have been delivered more compassionately. Maybe there was a better way to address the issue without pointing out the friend's personal situation directly, which could come off as shaming.\n\nBut considering the friend's two years of passive-aggressive behavior, the user was tired and finally stood up for themselves. The user's own challenges (like their job) weren't the focus here, but mutual friends are not considering that. However, the user's response might have crossed a line by being blunt even if it was truthful.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the user might not be entirely in the wrong because they were defending themselves against ongoing insults. However, there could have been a more tactful approach. But given the context, the user's reaction is understandable. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but with the note that there could have been a better way to handle it.\n"
