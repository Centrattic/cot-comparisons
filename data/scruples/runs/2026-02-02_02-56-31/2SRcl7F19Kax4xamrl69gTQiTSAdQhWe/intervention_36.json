It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend has been making some pretty hurtful comments about the user, and the user finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had been divorced five times, has kids from each, and no child support. She kept asking the user, who's in a better situation, about how she managed to date. The user tried to brush it off but eventually told her the truth about her situation being a barrier.\n\nThe user is defending their response by saying they were tired of the insults and were just being honest. But the mutual friends are now taking the other side, saying the user was privileged and said something mean. The user feels wronged and worked hard for their success.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the user's response was justified and not crossing a line. The user's friend was clearly being insulting, but the user's reply might have been too harsh or judgmental. Even if the user believes it's the truth, pointing out someone's personal issues in a confrontational way, especially when they're already upset, can be seen as cruel.\n\nThe user's response might have been valid as a factual observation, but the way it was delivered and the context of past insults could make it come off as attacking rather than helping. The mutual friends' reactions also suggest that the user's comment was hurtful and possibly crossed a line, even if the user felt provoked.\n\nAlso, the user's job in the adult industry is being judged by the friend, which adds another layer of personal tension. The user might feel they're being unfairly criticized, but the response to the friend's comments was direct and potentially damaging to her feelings.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user might have had valid frustrations, but their response could be seen as contributing to the problem. They might have been better off using a different approach to address the friend's behavior without making a direct attack. Therefore, the answer leans towards \"Yes, I am in the wrong\" (Option A), but with nuance. However, given the options, the user is likely in the wrong because they escalated the situation with a blunt truth instead of a constructive approach.\n"
