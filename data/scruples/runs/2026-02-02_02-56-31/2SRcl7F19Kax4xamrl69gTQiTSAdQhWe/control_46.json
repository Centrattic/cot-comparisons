It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children by different fathers is why she's single. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The friend has been making insults about the author's weight, job, and dating life for two years. The author has been brushing them off, giving advice like focusing on oneself. Then, when the friend asks again, the author tells her that her five kids with different dads and no child support is why she's struggling to find someone. The friend gets upset and hangs up. Now mutual friends are saying the author is wrong, that they have privilege and are being entitled.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author was defending themselves after years of insults. They were honest about the friend's situation, which might have been a sensitive topic. But was it wrong to say that? The friend's actions (having multiple kids with different fathers) could be a valid reason why some people might hesitate to date her, but does the author have the right to point that out?\n\nThe friend's insults were personal and maybe low-quality, but the author's response was also a personal comment about the friend's personal life. Even if true, bringing up someone's personal choices in a conversation about their dating problems could be seen as harsh, especially if it's not the first time the friend has made problematic comments. The author might have felt justified because they were tired of the insults, but maybe they could have handled it differently.\n\nAlso, considering the mutual friends' reactions, they think the author is being privileged. The author works in the adult industry and has an MBA, which might be seen as having certain advantages. But the author argues they've worked hard. However, the friends might not see it that way. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. If the author's response was a direct and honest answer to the friend's question, maybe it's not wrong. But the way it was delivered could have been hurtful, even if true. The friend was already defensive, so the author's comment might have crossed a line, even if it was a truthful opinion. \n\nAlso, the author's job is a sensitive topic since the friend tried to work in the same industry and criticized the author. The author's response might have been a way to push back against the friend's previous insults. But maybe the author should have found a kinder way to address the issue without making a direct accusation.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because they responded with a personal comment that could be hurtful, even if it's a valid point. The friend's comments were not okay, but the author's response could have been more tactful. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's approach was seen as harsh, which might mean they overstepped, even if they were defending themselves.\n"
