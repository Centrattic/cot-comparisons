It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's single because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making a lot of insulting comments about the author, and after two years of brushing them off, the author finally snapped and gave a blunt response. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and not understanding the friend's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's friend was making repeated, hurtful comments that were both personal and dismissive. The author tried to defuse them with polite responses but eventually felt cornered and responded with the truth they observed. The friend then reacted angrily and ended the conversation. \n\nThe key points to consider are: Was the friend's behavior justifiable? The friend's comments were clearly insults, targeting the author's weight, job, and relationship status. The author was defending themselves after being attacked repeatedly. However, the author's response was pointing out a specific issue (five kids with different fathers) that the friend might find sensitive. Even if the author's statement is factually true, it's a personal matter and could be perceived as a direct attack, especially if it's a source of pain for the friend.\n\nThe mutual friends are siding with the friend, suggesting they feel the author overstepped. The author is defensive, feeling that they've worked hard and aren't privileged. But the friends are pointing out that the author's response was harsh and maybe not the friend's fault. It's possible that the author's comment, while honest, was not the best way to address the situation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone is being insulted, responding with a personal truth about the other person's life could be seen as crossing a line. The author might have wanted to set boundaries, but the method could have been more constructive. The friend's behavior was problematic, but the author's response might have exacerbated the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for standing up for themselves after enduring insults, but the way they chose to respond could have been more tactful. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the friends are reacting negatively and the author's comment was a direct personal critique, it's possible that the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they addressed the friend's personal life in a way that might have been hurtful, even if the friend was being insulting. Alternatively, if the insults were so severe that the author was justified in pushing back, then B (not in the wrong) could be the case. The balance here is tricky, but since the author's response was a direct personal attack on the friend's situation, which might not be the most appropriate way to handle it, even in self-defense, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
